      "Students come to IIT Kanpur with many hopes and aspirations. While coming to their new home, it is expected that they get a community of people that provides them with fruitful interactions and an accepting environment. However, is this true for everyone?",
      "According to the Freshers’ Survey conducted byVox Populifor the Y24 batch, for a question regarding their sexualities, approximately 12% of the batch does not identify as heterosexual. This means that a significant number of students fall under the queer umbrella, and their experiences deserve attention too.",
      "This article aims to shed light on the experiences of queer students on campus,questioning the inclusivity of our environment and what more needs to be done.",
      "We conducted a series of anonymous interviews of queer students, and talked to the managers of Unmukt of the 2024-25 tenure to understand the challenges faced by them and reflect on how we can make IITK a more inclusive space for everyone.",
      "“I had really high and positive expectations from college… especially when the apparent “brightest minds of the country” come here. And I had heard of Unmukt – the gender and sexual diversity club at IITK as well. But the reality was quite the opposite”",
      "– Y23 UG student",
      "“Well, I thought IITians were well read and educated, boy was I wrong my first ethics session and its homophobia and misogyny galore”",
      "– Y23 UG student",
      "These are some of the responses of the interviewees when asked about their expectations from the people of the campus in terms of acceptance towards the LGBTQIA+ community.",
      "There was a stark difference between what people expected the community to be before they arrived here and how it is.",
      "From seniors making casual homophobic jokes during early wing meets to outright derogatory comments about queer identities, initial interactions often leave queer students feeling alienated.",
      "Post graduate queer students have also faced the brunt of the homophobia widely prevalent in the campus, with one 5th year PG student sharing how the initial conversations went-",
      "“The lab environment is largely heteronormative and the one time the conversation happened, one of our lab mates said they don’t support the LGBTQIA+ due to religious reasons”. However, he went on to say, “My initial friend group has always been supportive, or at least they did when I came out. Few of them are proud allies where we had meaningful discussions about various aspects covering gender and sexuality, whereas few don’t know much but unconditionally extend their support”. Another PG student claimed, ”Didn’t really come here with any expectations but I always found people around me here, accepting so I never really had to do the whole ‘coming out’ kind of thing.”",
      "“IITK is no different from my hometown (or my ug alma mater) when it comes to a supportive environment. The vast majority is unaware, and the rest are mostly conservative. The only aspect different is the sense of community (thanks to unmukt). Neither my alma mater or my native had a queer rights organization”",
      "Overall, all the interviewees agreed that the campus doesn’t present itself as an accepting place as a lot of them expected it to.",
      "We now look at how the daily conversations and interactions with their peers look like for queer students.",
      "“There were many many incidents with my wingmates and my department friends where they just said pretty homophobic and transphobic things openly out loud and it would get very uncomfortable for me”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "All of the interviewees reported witnessing instances of queerphobia from the people around them, with whom they regularly interacted. Here are some examples elaborating the queerphobic environment :",
      "“One such incident would be when my wingies were discussing, “If you were to become a baapu, what would you do if your bachha came out as gay?”…Even one of the sweetest and closest friends at the time, who I knew to be pretty kind-hearted, was like – “Agar mera bachha gay nikalega mai to uska gala kaat dunga”…”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "“If a girl has a boycut – chakka, hijra. A boy doesn’t actively talk about pussy – chakka. A boy doesn’t like sports, cars, gym, etc – chakka. A boy listens to Taylor Swift – chakka. I could go on and on with examples…”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "“I didn’t think people would be openly and blatantly homophobic like they are here, I thought they would keep their homophobic views to themselves. But here everyone takes pride in being queerphobic and keeps saying queerphobic things either to sound ‘cool’ or just for fun,”",
      "-PG Student",
      "Evidently such an unaccepting environment hinders the interaction queer people have with their peers. It also makes them conscious of themselves and the way they are perceived.",
      "“Consciousness as in it made me question every single action or behaviour of mine – how I talked, how I walked, what things I talked about with them, etc etc. Basically, every interaction I ever had with anyone, I had to make sure I didn’t give anything away.”",
      "– Y20 UG Student",
      "“Like I met my partner online here. We both live on campus… Initially we both would hesitate holding hands while walking in the campus, but we are both feel freer now, although whenever there’s a big group passing by, or a group of boys, we usually don’t hold hands.”",
      "-PG Student",
      "Due to all of this negativity, queer people are forced to remain closeted, this also implies that they are hidden from other queer people too. We found that it is extremely hard for queer people here to connect with other queer people because of the anonymity that everyone is forced to maintain.",
      "“It is almost impossible(to find other queer people). Even the one queer guy I found was sheer luck I’ll say. Because every queer person here is closeted, so unless you are out, other queer people won’t find out (unless they have a strong gaydar)”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "” It’s not easy to connect with other queer people on the campus, mostly because a lot of them are closeted for various reasons.”",
      "-Y20 UG Student",
      "From the responses it is evident that the campus community is largely queerphobic and it is difficult for queer people here to fit in. The next question is, are there any support systems on campus that can help them?",
      "Cognizance, an event for freshers focusing on gender sensitivity and queer awareness, is the only compulsory queer-awareness event on campus, however that too has some drawbacks as the event is conducted by the CTM’s who themselves aren’t sensitized enough to take a session. Some queer people believe Unmukt should take a more active role.",
      "“Cognizanceis a joke amongst my batchmates. It is something that is constantly being made fun of from time to time. But even personally I don’t like how it is being conducted and think more well-informed people should conduct it with better slides which have more than just Wikipedia-pasted information”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "“I didn’t even blame the kids; they didn’t know much. But the sad part was the CTMs didn’t either.”",
      "-Y23 UG Student",
      "The managers too believe the responsibility should lie withUnmukt.",
      "“I think it’ll be better if theUnmuktmanager and secretaries conductCognizance. We’d be able to touch on more sensitive topics.”",
      "-Auhona, Unmukt manager (2024-25)",
      "There are ongoing discussions to shift this responsibility toUnmukt, whose members may be better suited to lead such sessions with greater sensitivity and depth.",
      "Unmukt is the gender and sexual diversity forum of IIT Kanpur. They raise issues and awareness on all topics related to gender and sexuality, and advocate for a more inclusive campus for queer people.",
      "However, the body faces several challenges in the conduction of its events which include low participation and queerphobia, majorly stemming from the stigma that is attached to it.",
      "“Yes, there’s a lot of difficulty, both in terms of participation and the hate we receive. This is something any queer body faces—you get a lot of stigma attached to your organization. Because of this, people aren’t very willing to attend our events, and many mock those involved with Unmukt.”",
      "-Ragha Shrutilaya, Unmukt Manager (2024-25)",
      "There is a stigma attached not only to attending the events of Unmukt but also to being a part of Unmukt, and this often devolves into mocking and bullying.",
      "“There is no concept of “being an ally” thing. What I have heard in my case, since I went on to become a manager, probably I belong to the community.”",
      "-Auhona, Unmukt Manager(2024-25)",
      "“The secretaries in my tenure often told us that their wingmates questioned them about why they were part of Unmukt. I remember one guy who had been with us from the beginning, but he had to leave because he was being bullied for being a secretary of Unmukt.”",
      "– Ragha Shrutilaya, Unmukt Manager(2024-25)",
      "This  creates a gap between queer students, those interested in joining, and the organization itself. This is largely due to the perception that being associated with Unmukt automatically means someone is queer. As a result, both allies and queer individuals hesitate to engage with the group out of fear of being judged or outed.",
      "Auhona remarked –",
      "“Any event that Unmukt organizes sees low participation, and a major reason for this is the stigma attached to it. People worry about how they will be perceived if they attend.”",
      "Addressing this issue, a manager clarified,“A common misconception is that people think being part of Unmukt means you are gay. That’s completely untrue. There are many cishet (Cisgender Heterosexual) members on our team. You don’t have to be queer to support the community.”",
      "Ultimately, the stigma surrounding Unmukt stems from deep-rooted queerphobia.",
      "As pointed out by one of our interviewees, Unmukt is seen as a “gay club”, and those associated with it face ridicule and isolation. This pressure forces some students to cut ties with the organization or avoid it altogether. Unfortunately, this only worsens the struggles of queer students, who desperately need the safe space Unmukt strives to provide.",
      "The support systems are scarce, and those that exist face serious problems. This leaves queer students to face the queerphobia themselves, while hindering their ability to interact fruitfully with their peers.",
      "Although IIT Kanpur often presents itself as a space of open-mindedness and academic excellence, the lived experiences of queer students paint a different picture. From casual homophobic jokes to violent rhetoric it is embedded in everyday interactions.",
      "These aren’t isolated incidents. Nearly every queer student we spoke to recalled moments of discomfort, fear, or invisibility, whether it was feeling the need to police their mannerisms, avoid holding hands with their partner on campus, or being unable to connect with others like them due to the enforced closet many are pushed into.",
      "Even institutional efforts meant to offer support, like Cognizance, fall short due to the lack of proper sensitization among those conducting them. Meanwhile,Unmukt, the only body actively advocating for queer rights, is often met with ridicule, low participation, and stigma.",
      "The result is a culture of silence and suppression. Queer students are not just struggling with acceptance they are often struggling alone.",
      "We must move beyond surface-level inclusion and start having necessary conversations about queerphobia on campus. True change will only come when awareness is met with accountability from peers, from institutions, and from ourselves.",
      "To conclude, as one of our interviewees put it:",
      "“Since this is meant to be read by the campus junta, I would probably just want them to know and believe thatqueer people are so much more than being queer.",
      "",
      "Because a common rant I hear from homophobic people is that “gay people try to shove their sexuality in our faces”. I am here to work hard, study, make my future, make friends and have fun. I don’t ask for sympathy from anyone just because I am gay.All I ask for(and probably every other queer person as well)is to not feel isolated and left out, solely because of a little part of myself.I have a life outside of my sexuality, just like you…",
      "",
      "I only ask for people to understand me, nothing else. And no, I am not mentally retarded or mentally ill or abnormal – I worked hard to crack the same exam that you did to come here, and completely by merit, so my sexuality has no relation with my potential.”",

      "On the 10th of February 2025, Mr Ankit Yadav, a PhD scholar in the Department of Chemistry, took his own life. He was a research scholar who joined the institute in July 2024 with a UGC Fellowship.",
      "A statement from the Kanpur Police Commissioner via a post on X noted the occurrence of the suicide and indicated that the necessary legal procedures were set to begin.",
      "During the late hours of 10th February, students visited the Director at his residence in orderto raise concerns regarding the circumstances of the incident. Following this, the PhD and PostDoc students of the Chemistry Department wrote an open letter titled, “Urgent Request for Judicial Inquiry into Suicidal Incident and Mental Harassment by Prof. Parthasarathi Subramanian.” The letter indicated that 10 students had left the said professor’s lab in the past few years. We reached out to people who were previously involved with the Professor’s lab and tried to understand their views.",
      "Disclaimer: This letter is not written/compiled by Vox and represents the views of the individuals involved.",
      "Disclaimer: This is an account of people who formerly worked at the lab, presented here in a concise manner. These are personal testimonies compiled by Vox and  represent the views of the  individuals involved",
      "Multiple former members recall that their initial interaction with Prof. Parthasarathi Subramanian was pleasant, but this changed soon after joining the lab. It was made clear from the second day that lab timings were strictly enforced—8:30 AM to 9:00 PM. Students were expected to be inside the lab at exactly 8:30 AM. Even a short delay would result in a phone call from the professor, warning them about their future in the lab.  Additionally, students were often required to work in the lab at midnight.",
      "These constraints extended tomeal breaks. Students were allotted exactly 40 minutes for lunch, and extra time spent was questioned. A tea break at 5:30 PM was permitted, but they were required to return precisely at 6:00 PM. On multiple days, dinner time was disrupted by the professor, who would begin long discussions on Chemistry research at 8:45 PM.",
      "Several students confirmed that CCTV cameras were installed in the lab, and theysuspectedthe professor had remote access to live footage. When away from the lab, he would call one student and ask them to pass the phone around to verify everyone’s presence.",
      "This also extended to monitoring and purchase of chemicals. While most labs purchase standard chemicals commercially, students here were expected to synthesise them manually, which significantly increased their workload.",
      "Weekly work reports were mandatory in his lab, and students were required to conduct a minimum offive successful reactionsper week. Failure to meet this resulted in reprimands. Additionally, every Saturday, a Literature Group Meeting was held, and every student was required to present a paper. This is different from other groups, where usually one student would present each week or every other week on a rotating basis.",
      "The immense pressure led to physical and mental health deterioration. At least one former student reported weight loss and frequent fevers due to stress. Others struggled to even speak to their families due to the mental burden.",
      "A student recalled an incident where someone was caught speaking in Hindi inside the lab. The professor claimed that the student was “destroying the lab culture” and threatened expulsion. Another described how even minor mistakes would be repeatedly brought up for months, used as a pretext for constant scolding.",
      "Some students described a feeling of helplessness —even those who left the lab found it difficult to recover professionally.",
      "Despite all these incidents, most students never officially reported the professor’s behaviour. The primary reason?Fear.",
      "The professor frequently threatened students with expulsion from the lab, knowing that leaving mid-PhD would destroy their academic careers.  The intense mental stress made students feel isolated and incapable of seeking help.",
      "Some students needed recommendations and certificates from the professor for future applications, forcing them to endure the environment.",
      "Following these events, we conducted a survey among PhD students in the Chemistry Department to assess the current situation and gather insights on their experiences. Out of nearly 300 PhD students in the Chemistry Department, 107 of them responded to this anonymous survey. We present the data and anecdotal evidence collected here.",
      "Majority of the students find their supervisor fairly approachable. However, 43 students find their supervisor unreasonably strict or dismissive of their concerns.61% of respondents (65 students)stated that they had not personally experienced power abuse from their supervisor.",
      "However, the remaining respondents either directly faced or witnessed instances of discrimination, mental harassment, undue pressure, or threats. These included instances of",

On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely difficult and 5 being very easy),only 17.7% of students (8.4% rated 1 and 9.3% rated 2)found it very difficult to get leave. In contrast,nearly 60% (27.1% rated 4 and 32.7% rated 5)found it relatively easy to take leave, with 22.4% remaining neutral.",
      "While most students did not find taking leave extremely difficult, a notable fraction still experienced inconsistencies in leave policies across different labs.",

      "85% of students (91 out of 107)reported that their labs had no audio-video surveillance, while12.1% (13 students)confirmed its presence.Around 3% (3 students)preferred not to disclose this information.",
      "“At IIT Kanpur, research scholars are no longer treated as scientists but as laborers burdened with deadlines. Their schedules are micromanaged to the point where even their lunch breaks are monitored.”– Anonymous Response.",
      "The survey reveals that a majority (72.9% or 70 out of 96 respondents) do not feel comfortable reporting academic harassment due to fear of retaliation. Many students have refrained from lodging complaints, citing risks to their careers, lack of independent grievance mechanisms, and concerns about bias.",
      "Among those who did report issues, authorities approached included the Head of Department (HOD), Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC), Director, and Dean of Students’ Affairs (DOSA).",

A smaller proportion indicated negative experiences, with 11 respondents (10.3%) stating their concerns were dismissed once or twice and six respondents (5.6%) reporting multiple instances of dismissal.",
      "When asked whether the supervisor asked them to complete his/her personal tasks unrelated to research work, 16 respondents (15%) stated that they were asked once or twice, and 13 respondents (12.1%) reported being asked multiple times.",

      "Executives of the Student Gymkhana organised a candle march from Hall – 7 to Kargil Chowk in memory of the lost soul. Following this, an open house with Gymkhana Representatives was conducted at the OAT. This was attended by a large number of students who, after elaborate discussions, arrived at a comprehensive set of demands. We summarise the set of demands and the response from the administration in the next paragraph.",
      "Immediate suspension of Prof. Parthasarathi Subramanian: Until the external committee’s investigation is concluded, Prof. Subramanian be suspended. Additionally, he should not have any communication with the students in his lab till then. He should also be relieved of his position as the Maintenance Warden of Hall 10.",
      "Prof. Parthasarathi has been relieved of his position as the Maintenance Warden of Hall X.",
      "Regarding Prof. Subramanian’s lab: As communicated to the student representatives, the lab has been closed until further notice. However, it should be ensured that the lock be installed by the institute and not by the professor. Further, ensure that surveillance footage from labs is preserved and presented to the investigation committee.",
      "Prof. Parthasarathi’s lab has been sealed until further notice and he no longer has access to the same.",
      "Regarding the investigation:A fully independent committee without  no faculty member from any institute should be constituted. It should be composed of ex-IFS/IPS officers, ex-defence officials etc. to ensure independence and a fair investigation. Additionally, The committee should also collect statements from the deceased student’s family and conduct an open house with students.",
      "The Director agreed to co-opt 2 student members in the committee to ensure a transparent and fair investigation, as student members can facilitate necessary testimonies to be considered by the committee. Additionally, it was clarified that the report of the committee would be prepared by the end of February, post which further action can be taken. The Director clearly stated that he would not hesitate in taking necessary steps, if so deemed fit based on the findings.",
      "Reviewing labs across campus:An anonymous committee be set up that reviews all research labs in the institute and converse with students in each lab to understand the atmosphere and situation associated with each lab.",

Students who have any grievances that are not being addressed by their departmental functionaries such as the DPGC Convener/HoD can send an email to this ID. Only the DoSA would have access to the emails received, and the complaints shall be resolved in a confidential manner with an option of escalation to the Director, if required.",
      "The Director opined that video recordings in some cases may be necessary since the lab can contain equipment but expressed strong discontent with audio recordings.",
      "Regarding the Institute Counselling Service: Address issues of trust deficit with ICS and investigate breach of confidentiality. An ICS feedback form be floated, so that anonymous feedback can be collected. Additionally, it is proposed that a portal be set up where students can anonymously chat with counsellors online to express their distress without revealing their identity",
      "It has been informed that a Centre for Mental Health and Well-Being has already been approved and work is ongoing regarding the same. This would be run only by professional third-party experts.",
      "Faculty sensitization: A psychometric check of all faculty should be conducted, especially during recruitment. Faculty who has been expelled from other institutes should not be considered for recruitment at IIT Kanpur and a su icient check in this",
      "The Director communicated that conducting a psychometric test for faculties during recruitment is a step that can be looked into. He said that discussions would have to be taken up for the implementation of the same.",
      "The Director and DoSA conducted an open house with the PG students of the Chemistry department. Additionally, it was communicated that an Open House for other departments would also be conducted after the mid-semester exams.",

      "The Undergraduate Academic Review Committee (UGARC) at IIT Kanpur reviews the undergraduate curriculum every ten years to create a student-centric education system that rivals top global universities. UGARC 2020-2021 introduced significant changes, including new degree options like BTM/BSM and BTH/BSH, which offered tailored pathways for industry and research, as well as Study Resource Centres (SRC), inter-departmental degrees, and academic counselling and guidance centre (ACG). These changes aim to provide flexibility and maximise learning potential. This article explores the effectiveness of policy implementation, the timeline for upcoming batches, the challenges in executing some proposals and the roles of students, faculty, and administrators in driving these academic reforms.",
      "Through an interview with Prof. P. Venkitanarayanan (ME), chairperson of the implementation group for UGARC 2020-21, we learned that small changes, such as updating individual course contents or offering a new elective, are generally easier to faster. However, large-scale changes, such as overhauling the curriculum or introducing new degree programs, require extensive consultations and discussions across multiple departments and stakeholders, necessitating substantial coordination, time, and human resources.  The approval process for major changes is lengthy and involves multiple layers of review and approval, including input from departmental committees, faculty boards, and external accreditation bodies. Additionally, there can be resistance from faculty, administrators, and students accustomed to the existing system. Overcoming this resistance requires extensive communication, negotiation, and sometimes compromise.",
      "As explained by Prof. Nitin Saxena, the chair of UGARC’21, updating the curriculum is crucial for staying relevant in a rapidly evolving world, aligning with global standards to prepare graduates for international environments, and giving institutions a competitive edge. Interdisciplinary courses promote integrated learning, enhancing the educational experience. Progressive academic policies and a modern curriculum boost the institution’s reputation, attracting top talent and maintaining an active academic community. Curriculum updates are also essential for maintaining accreditation, improving rankings, and enhancing employability by ensuring graduates possess in-demand competencies and are proficient with the latest technologies.",
      "Several proposals, such as a granular grading system, modularising IC courses like MTH101 and ESC101, and introducing an ethics course and the SCHEME basket, have already been implemented and adequately integrated into our academic structure.",
      "To this end, the report also proposes these significant changes:",
      "These new degree options address two key issues in our current academic system:",
      "Prof. Nitin Saxena, chair of the committee, emphasised that restricted departments must accommodate diverse interests.",
      "The proposal aims to shift from one-size-fits-all degrees to more flexible degree options that fit the requirements of students with different interests and aptitudes. It pushes for three significant changes:",
      "The regular BTech/BS programme is split into three tracks- the regular BTech/BS degree, the BTM/BSM degree, which will have a mix of technical and industry/management-related content, and the BTH/BSH degree, an honours track, which would require additional DE credits compared to the regular BT degree.",
      "Secondly, the creation of a Study Resource Centre(SRC) is proposed to accommodate different interests. The SRC will offer new courses related to ethics, communication, IT, technology, entrepreneurship, and management. The SRC staff will be hired based only on research and teaching skills, forming a cadre of non-tenured faculty. This is the same process as recruiting tenured faculty.",
      "Lastly, it entails the creation of inter-department degrees. This would be a 4-year programme offered by a pair of departments, with the number of credits being the same as any other BTech degree.",
      "As we understand from our discussion with Prof. Nitin Saxena, the impact of these changes would be vast and expected to solve issues such as poor attendance, high failure rates, poor academic performance and disinterest leading to mental health problems, disenchantment of course instructors and dilution of BTech degrees.",
      "As explained by Prof Nitin Saxena, the committee recognized that students’ diverse backgrounds and varied aptitudes invariably lead to a wide diversity of perceived student abilities. Thus, even the high ideals of the teacher and the tall spirits of the student have not been able to circumvent the termination of a good fraction of these students. The motivation behind this change was the students who had nothing to show for their efforts at the end of 4-5 years of being in this institute due to their degrees being terminated.",
      "To help ‘academically deficient’ students, the creation of an Academic Counseling & Guidance(ACG) centre is proposed. The idea would be to divide students into categories- A, B, C and D in order of their credit accumulation rates. Parents of C and D category students would be alerted, and their performance shared. By doing so, the ACG would also act as a conduit between the Institute and parents, so that parents do not abruptly receive the news about termination. The ACG would regularly meet with these students and counsel students in vulnerable categories (B, C, D). They would recognise the hurdles they face by conversing with the students and sensitising instructors to their issues.",
      "The option of an Alternate Degree would arise when, even after providing all support and monitoring, some students struggle to complete all their courses. These students can complete 300 credits with some support and be offered an alternative degree.",
      "This proposal aims to provide timely support and guidance to these students so that each can have a fruitful end to their time at a campus that does not hinder their prospects.",
      "Another proposal of UGARC aims to add more flexibility to coursework by introducing the following options:",
      "These changes help accommodate student preferences, skills, and expectations, creating a more personalised educational experience.",
      "These changes aim to take a step away from the one-size-fits-all model and strive to offer an enormous scope of opportunities for UG academics.",
      "Through interviews with Prof. P. Venkit Narayan (ME) and the Dean of Academic Affairs (DOAA), along with insights from various departmental faculty members and students, we explore the current status of these changes and the roadblocks faced along the way.",
      "Prof. P. Venkitanarayanan highlighted that establishing interdepartmental degrees was particularly challenging due to the nature of the program. Departments had to align their curricula, share resources, and agree on joint degree programs, which involved overcoming bureaucratic hurdles and differing academic priorities. Despite these challenges, there has been progress, with some departments already working on templates for interdepartmental degrees.",
      "Specific proposals did not require extensive resources, such as introducing the honours program for both bachelor programs (namely the BTH/BSH programs), which were quickly adopted and implemented by most departments. Bachelor of Technology (Management) (BTM) and Bachelor of Science (Management) (BSM) degrees, on the other hand, have yet to see such progress. Prof. Venkitanarayanan emphasised that new programs BTM and BSM were thoughtfully designed to offer students flexible and inclusive pathways into management studies without any CPI restrictions. The selection process will be crafted to attract students who are genuinely inclined towards management, regardless of their academic standing in other subjects.",
      "Prof. Venkitanarayanan highlighted that programs like Honors and BTM/BSM are set to be available to students by their fifth or sixth semester, starting with the Y22 batch. This aligns with the committee’s vision of providing more tailored and relevant educational opportunities to students, ensuring that those with a genuine interest in management are given the chance to pursue their goals. However, this program remains to be behind the proposed schedule.",
      "Despite this careful planning and clear vision, the DOAA pointed out that the full-fledged implementation of these programs has been slower than anticipated. The delay has been attributed to a need for more resources, including faculty and administrative support, further complicating post-COVID recovery efforts. The DOAA also noted the difficulty in finding qualified and willing faculty members to lead these programs, which has been a significant roadblock. The groundwork for these programs has been laid, but their successful implementation will require overcoming the current resource constraints and ensuring that the necessary support structures are in place.",
      "One of the critical initiatives of the UGARC’21 is the proposal to establish an academic counselling group (ACG) and a study resource centre (SRC). These initiatives aim to provide specialized academic guidance and support to students, particularly those who are academically weaker. The role of ACG counsellors is distinct from that of existing counselling services. While the latter provides general psychological and emotional support, ACG counsellors focus on academic guidance. Prof. Venkitanarayanan emphasised the recommendation of UGARC regarding the need for qualified counsellors who are well-versed in departmental requirements and capable of assisting students needing academic guidance. The implementation of ACG is being actively pursued with a plan to hire 30-40 counsellors for the entire institute to help students categorised under C and D grades.",
      "Similarly, the establishment of SRC has faced setbacks due to the need for additional resources and trained personnel. The SRC is intended to offer courses managed by the Industrial and Management Engineering (IME) department and be accessible to all students, not just those who are academically challenged. Training non-regular faculty to assign grades and ensuring the centre’s courses are relevant and effective are ongoing challenges.",
      "According to the DOAA, the ACG includes various components, such as the ELC and ethics courses, and emphasises the availability of academic mentors tailored to assist the students. However, the DOAA highlighted significant challenges in implementing the ACG effectively. For example, if a student from the Mechanical Engineering department is failing a statistics course, only the Statistics department can adequately provide the necessary support. Moreover, the DOAA expressed concerns about bringing in external experts, citing their potential lack of understanding of the rigorous academic environment at IITK.",
      "The Departmental Monitoring Committee (DMC) formation at the PG level was mentioned in the PGARC’21 report as a positive step, as it helps doctoral students on a per-semester basis, guiding them in their research journey. This has been a successful implementation, according to the DOAA, with five members assisting each student on how to proceed further in their research.",
      "Another significant change is the proposal to allow admissions through channels other than the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). This change aims to diversify the student body and open opportunities for students with different talents and backgrounds. Departments such as Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Biological Sciences and Bioengineering (BSBE), and Chemistry have agreed to pilot this initiative. It will be implemented starting the next academic year.",
      "Challenges with Internship Credits",
      "Another significant issue raised in our discussion with the DOAA was the process for claiming internship credits. Students are required to enrol in the semester and claim these credits as a course, which also involves paying to register for the semester. While this system is in place, the added financial burden on students has been a point of contention.",
      "UGARC’s efforts to implement new rules and update the academic curriculum are essential to maintaining the institution’s growth and relevance. While progress has been made, particularly in areas requiring fewer resources, implementing larger-scale changes faces significant challenges. Interviews highlight underlying systemic issues that impede the adoption of new proposals, including resource limitations, the challenge of recruiting staff to lead new initiatives, a lack of administrative support, and the ongoing impact of post-COVID recovery. The timeline for implementing these initiatives remains to be determined, with outcomes largely contingent on the availability of resources and other constraints.",

      "On February 19, 2025, the Council of Students for Hostel Affairs (CoSHA) held its second emergency meeting in the Senate Hall to discuss the recent eviction notice served to the Dhobis, whose deadline to vacate was set for March 6. This meeting was attended by Hall Presidents, Gymkhana representatives and a number of GBMs.",
      "According to the published minutes, “The central theme of the discussion was that the students, being the majority stakeholders of the service, were never consulted before the eviction notices were served to the Dhobis.”",
      "The institute’s long-term modernization plan was a topic of discussion. The Director’s proposal (as reported previously), which involved establishing a central laundromat with industrial-grade washing machines operated by the Dhobis, was unanimously opposed. As recorded in the minutes, “As part of a long-term modernization plan, the institute wanted to eventually set up a central laundromat with industrial grade washing machines operated by the dhobis themselves. The CoSHA, representative of the student body, was unanimous in its disagreement with the same, citing reasons of hygiene, convenience and concerns of privatization.”",
      "The basis for the eviction was another focal point. The notice deemed Dhobi Ghat unsafe for residence based on two reports—from the Structural Engineering Laboratory of IIT Kanpur and the Department of Civil Engineering at HBTU. The minutes note, “It was noted that neither of the two reports were made available to the GBM to see and…  stated that despite emails sent to 9 professors concerned with the above two bodies by Vox Populi, six of them failed to acknowledge the existence of the reports and three did not reply. The Chairperson, CoSHA then confirmed that he and the Chairperson, Students’ Senate had seen the report from the HBTU but not the other report.”",
      "On the idea of using hall-14 for the storage of clothes, the minutes state, “The CoSHA agreed that rooms in Hall 14 would never be an option as firstly the sparse quantity was not enough for the Dhobis to carry out daily work and secondly as student intake will increase over the years the Dhobis would gradually be forced out again.”",
      "Concerns were also raised about the manner in which the eviction notices were served. One entry in the minutes reads, “It was pointed out that despite the institute acknowledging its humanitarian obligation towards the Dhobis, they were always threatened with ultimatums, police threats, and a large swath of security guards always accompanying the people serving the notices. They were also told that bulldozers would be used if they did not vacate.”",
      "Lastly, a discrepancy in official communications was discussed saying that “GBMs present in the meeting pointed out a major incident where an English version of a letter given by the institute directly contradicted the Hindi version and how the legal authorities would only consider the English version in case of any discrepancy. This contradiction in the notices was dismissed as ‘a typo’ by the institute.”",
      "The CoSHA, in its meeting on the 19th of February, 2025, keeping the best interest of the students in retaining the washerman services, decided unanimously the following courses of action henceforth.",
      "(i) A two way GBM between the dhobis and students where they could discuss the student stance adopted in this meeting.",
      "(ii) A three way Open House between the Dhobis (Service givers), Students (Service receivers) and the Director must be held before their eviction on the 6th of March, 2025.",
      "(iii) The students would not accept any alternative for the dhobi services in the near future, and the student representatives would present a stance of dissent against automation in this regard.",
      "(iv) The students, as the receivers of the service, would not accept the institute administration acting without listening to their stance on the matter.",
      "The CoSHA and its members present the following points to the administration after consultation with the Dhobis in the two way GBM:",
      "The next day, student representatives met with the Dhobis to confirm their support for the demands outlined in the CoSHA meeting, which the Dhobis affirmed. Later that evening, hall presidents and the PSG Chair met with the Director to discuss the proceedings",
      "According to a Gymkhana representative present at the meeting, the Director rejected the students’ opposition to mechanization and reaffirmed that modernization was essential for sustainability. Students also maintained that Hall 14 was not a viable storage space for the Dhobis. One of the Hall Presidents suggested setting up of tin sheds for storage of clothes, as the existing godowns had been declared structurally unsafe in the reports. Currently, sixteen six-foot-by-six-foot tin shed structures have been erected at one end of Dhobi Ghat.",
      "Tin Sheds erected at one end of Dhobi Ghat",
      "On March 4, student representatives, professors, and several GBMs gathered at Dhobi Ghat to discuss the evolving situation. The meeting concluded with three unanimously agreed points –",
      "In addition to these demands, those present at the meeting demanded that the Senate convene an emergency meeting to pass a resolution on the issue. Gymkhana representatives acknowledged the existence of this channel, but also added that the proceedings of CoSHA themselves serve as a strong expression of student opinion and demands.",
      "The following day (5th March), President, Students Gymkhana informed the senate via mail that  “the Director has officially confirmed the postponement of the Dhobis’ eviction deadline until a proper dialogue between the administrators and Dhobis is held, in the presence of the Director and students upon his return to campus.”",
      "On March 8, 2025, a meeting was convened in the Faculty Building to address the ongoing Dhobi issue. In contrast to earlier demands for an open house session, the meeting was open to Dhobis and 4 Gymkhana representatives only. Senior officials including the Director, Deputy Director, DoSA, DoAd, and the Registrar were also present. We spoke to a gymkhana representative to understand what was discussed in the meeting.",
      "Key points included:",
      "In summary, the three key demands outlined in the CoSHA meeting—",
      "Werenotaccepted by the Director and other officials.",
      "Neither the student representatives nor the Dhobi community agreed to the proposals presented at the meeting. Both groups confirmed that further internal discussions are needed before reaching any final decision.",
      "The Director concluded by agreeing to send an official email to the campus community by the following day. The email is expected to detail the complete history of the issue, outline the current situation, and present the administration’s future plans, thereby ensuring transparency and addressing any communication gaps. As of today, students have not received  this mail by the Director.",
      "On March 9th, four cameras had been installed at Dhobhighat—three near the drying sites and one at the entrance. With no toilet facilities available, Dhobis are forced to use open spaces for defecation and have objected to the camera placements, arguing that these installations restrict the areas they rely on for this basic need.",
      "Until further updates, thedemolition is set to begin tomorrow."

      "On January 3, 2025, the dhobis received their third eviction notice (each of the  dhobhis received it separately), requiring them to appear before the Institute authority on Monday, January 20 under the Eviction Act of 1971. The notice, signed by the Estate Officer, stated that occupying the Type IA quarters, stores, and other structures at the dhobighat was illegal, and it accused them of engaging in unauthorized commercial activity. As mandated by law, they were asked to present their case on the designated date. After the meeting on January 20, the institute issued a public notice on the issue. We spoke with the dhobis to learn more about their perspective.",
      "The notice is premised on the claim that –“After examination of the documents produced before the undersigned, Estate Officer, of opinion that the opposite party is in unauthorized occupation of the scheduled premises.”",
      "The dhobis contest this claim, saying that their occupation of the premises is legally recognized and historically documented. They cite official allotment letters (refer to website) issued by the Estate Office, which they claim formalized their residence and workspaces in Type IA houses, storage facilities (godowns), and designated washing tanks (haudas) at the dhobighat. According to them, these allotments, dating back to the 1960s and continuing until at least 2002, contain no specified expiration date, hence their argument that their tenure was intended to be long-term.",
      "They further argue that their occupancy has been acknowledged through consistent financial transactions with the Institute. Since 1989, they have been making regular payments for rent, water, and electricity, which they state were officially recorded and processed. As proof, they present payment receipts and utility bills, the most recent of which date to January 2020. They argue that these transactions demonstrate institutional recognition of their legal occupancy over the years.",
      "In addition to these financial records, the dhobis point to official government-issued documentation linking them to Dhobighat. They note that their Aadhar cards list Dhobighat as their registered residential address—an inclusion they argue would not have been possible without valid proof of residence.",
      "For some Dhobis, the notice says that – “The opposite party did not submit any document supporting any authority/allotment in his favour for occupation of the instant scheduled premises”",
      "The dhobis state that they formally drafted a response letter and allocation documents outlining their objections to the eviction notice. According to them, they attempted to deliver the letter and Documents  in person to the Estate Office during the 20th January hearing, but officials refused to accept it. In response, they sent the letter via speed post, attaching copies of their supporting documents, including allotment letters, payment records, and identification proofs. However, they report that the Estate Office did not acknowledge receiving these documents.",
      "Response Letter by the Dhobis",
      "In particular, they claim that photocopies of key documents were dismissed, though no explanation was provided for their rejection. An order sheet issued on January 28 stated that “the opposite party presented xerox copies of letter number.…. in support of occupancy of said house. The veracity of these letters cannot be ascertained due to not being in original form”. The dhobis state that since they had to submit these proofs via speed post, it was not feasible for them to attach the original documents.",
      "The notice claims, among other things that –“The opposite party admitted that he has been occupying in the house no. 39A of Type-I without any authority in his name..”",
      "The dhobis refute this claim, calling it a fabrication. They tell us at no point did they acknowledge their occupation as unlawful and argue that this statement misrepresents their position.",
      "Efforts to seek clarification from the Estate office regarding the recent eviction notice for Dhobighat workers yielded no response. However, the President, Students’ Gymkhana informed Vox that the Institute Director was open to providing a statement",
      "According to the Director, the primary reason for the eviction is the structural instability of the Dhobighat buildings rather than the validity of the workers’ allotment letters. Additionally, he emphasized the Institute’s sustainability goals, noting that per capita water consumption on campus is three times higher than the standard, with unmonitored water wastage at Dhobighat.",
      "To address these concerns, the Institute plans to introduce a centralized, industrial-grade laundry system, which is expected to improve efficiency (Faster Washing Cycles) and reduce water consumption. Until the new system is operational, the existing water tanks at Dhobighat will not be demolished. The affected workers will be provided temporary storage space for clothes at Hall 14 and offered employment within the new mechanized system.",
      "The Director also  stated that the workers would be eligible for housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and help from the institute, with alumni offering interim rental support until permanent housing is secured through the scheme.",
      "The dhobis, in their response, outline their position in the response letter (translated from Hindi) as an issue centered around livelihood instead of residence –",
      "“If the Institute requires the dhobighat site for some other purpose, the Institute needs to provide us with appropriate alternate arrangements and relocate our workplace somewhere else on campus premises. Our work requires the following:",
      "And given the nature of our work, we (our family) need access to our workplace throughout the day. If the above conditions are met, we are ready to leave our current workplace and place of residence. But we are shocked that even after 6 decades of our sincere service, the Institute, instead of initiating a constructive dialogue with us about possible relocation, has served us with eviction notices. To end, we only wish to carry on our services to the community in an undisrupted manner and earn our livelihood in the process. This work is the primary source of income for my family”",
      "As of now, the final ruling orders the dhobis and their families to vacate the premises within 30 days (6th March). The verdict further states that if they “refuse or fail to comply,” they will be “liable to be evicted…, if need be, by the use of such force as may be necessary.”",
      "This report covers events as of 19th February, 2025. Further developments on the issue include a CoSHA meeting and discussions of student representatives and Hall Presidents with the director. Vox is awaiting the official release of the meeting minutes and will publish an update once they are available.",

      "The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is an initiative by the Government of India to evaluate and rank higher education institutions based on comprehensive criteria. Introduced in 2015 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), now known as the Ministry of Education, it provides students, parents, and policymakers with valuable insights into institutional performance by assessing parameters liketeaching, research, employability, and infrastructure.Additionally, NIRF encourages a culture of excellence and innovation, aligns Indian institutions with global standards, and serves as a strategic tool for resource allocation and policy formulation in higher education.",
      "The NIRF rankings for 2024 are released across16 categories.IIT Kanpur participated in five of these categories:Overall,Engineering,Research,Innovation, andManagement.While it secured notable rankings such as 4th in Engineering, 5th Overall, and 7th in Research, there was anotable dropin theInnovation categoryfrom 1st in 2023 to 5th in 2024. InManagement, IIT Kanpur ranked 29th, reflecting its newer and evolving management programs​. This article delves deeper into the performance factors and the reasons behind this shift in ranking.",
      "Disclaimer:For the overall section of the NIRF rankings, we initially interviewed the then DOAA, Prof. Shalabh. However, upon reviewing the draft for verification, he requested that his comments not be published, as his tenure was about to end and advised us to seek the same information from the new DOAA. We then reached out to the new DOAA, Prof. Ashoke De, who redirected us to the Institute’s ranking cell, which operates under the Deputy Director, Prof. Braj Bhushan. Subsequently, we contacted the ranking cell but have not yet received a response.",
      "The Overall category in the NIRF rankings provides a comprehensive assessment of higher education institutions, evaluating their performance across multiple disciplines and functions. It focuses on factors like teaching quality, research output, graduation outcomes, inclusivity, and perception, offering a broad perspective on an institution’s overall excellence.",
      "Our analysis of NIRF reports shows that IIT Kanpur is the only top-five IIT withfewer than 300 faculty membershaving over15 years of experience. Additionally, the number offemale faculty members at IITKis thelowestamong IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Roorkee. Nevertheless, IIT Kanpur maintains thehighest faculty-to-student ratioamong the top IITs,standing at 0.068,surpassing IIT Madras, IIT Bombay, IIT Roorkee, and IIT Delhi.",
      "We reviewed the online course offerings of IITs via platforms like MOOCs and noted a surge in courses from IIT Kanpur in 2020-21, followed by a decrease the next year.",
      "An intriguing finding related to research funding was that while institutes like IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, and IIT Madras have each received approx. 326, 408, and 499 crores, respectively, forsponsored researchaveraged over the past three years, IIT Kanpur has secured only₹237 crores.Though the number of sponsored research projects has been on the rise, thetotal fundingreceived has seen adecline.",
      "According to the Deputy Director, Dr Braj Bhushan Singh, there are two primary reasons for lesser research funding. First, the number of faculty at IITK has traditionally been significantly lower than that of other old IITs, which inevitably reduces the number of researchers. Second, there is less focus on writing large projects when a group of faculty members comes together. Over the past few years, the institute has recruited a significant number of faculty and is now encouraging faculty to bid for large projects.",
      "Another observation based on the data submitted by IITs to the NIRF was that IIT Kanpur (IITK) has received thelowest funding for consultancy projectscompared to other top IITs. Addressing this, the Deputy Director explained that consultancy projects largely depend on faculty expertise, leading to various project types. Regarding funding, he emphasised that the allocation of funds is influenced by the size of the faculty. Theinstitute’s funding for consultancy projectshasalmost tripled in the previous three years, as reflected in the submitted data.",
      "After analysing data across various other IITs, it’s evident that the percentage of students pursuing higher studies has dropped significantly over the past three years. However, IIT Kanpur continues to haveone of the highest percentages of studentspursuing further education, with24% of undergraduatesand26% of postgraduatesopting for advanced studies after graduating from IITK in the academic year 2022-23.",
      "A concerning number that we came across while researching was the average number of full-time PhD students that have graduated in the last three years. This number was218 in IIT Kanpur, being the second lowest in older IITs, compared to the likes of Bombay, which had the highest, 328.",
      "Peer perception refers to evaluating an institution’s reputation and quality as assessed by other institutions. It involves feedback collected from academic peers (such as faculty members, researchers, and administrators) and industry professionals familiar with the institution. This peer perception score helps NIRF assess how well the institution is regarded in terms of its academic and research excellence, infrastructure, and overall contributions to education and society. This is done through a large-scale survey conducted by NIRF itself, thereby creating a comprehensive list that takes into account various sectors, regions, and other factors. This list is dynamic and is updated periodically. The following infographic shows the scores of top IITs in the peer perception category. IIT Kanpur lacks here as compared to top IITs, scoring significantly lower than IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, and IIT Bombay.",
      "Innovation, as a category, was only introduced in 2023 to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across Indian higher education institutions. NIRF Innovation aims to motivate institutions to focus on research and development that leads to practical solutions and helps build a globally competitive environment for fostering advanced innovations.",
      "In 2024,808 institutes registeredin this category, whileonly 10 were ranked and published.IIT Kanpur ranked1st in innovationin the year of the category’s inception but experienced a significant decline to5th in the latest 2024 edition.To delve deeper into the reasons for this fall, we at Vox Populi interviewed Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, former professor-in-charge of SIIC, IITK. The following part of the article is primarily based on this interview.",
      "When asked about the rankings, he remarked, “Rankings are a very interesting thing. We are happy when we get a good ranking, and we absolutely don’t like the concept when it’s bad. I am not a fan of these rankings as they don’t capture the parameters that should be captured.” He also shed light on the challenging task of data collection, stating, “The whole process of collecting these data from the startups of the institute is not a trivial task. Last year, when I was involved, I personally had to call them all to get the data as they don’t have any incentive to give the data for NIRF.” He also pointed out thatstartups have a long gestation period.At IIT Kanpur, thebulk of startupsthat started on a productive scalehappened after 2019.So, the numbers can go up again in upcoming years.",
      "Adding along similar lines, Prof. Braj Bhushan said,“Last year was the first time it was announced, and we did a better job in providing data than many others, resulting in a high rank. This year, others have also provided full data, and the criteria is also different.”",
      "In the Research and Innovation Output section, IITK has214 patents granted in the past three years (2020 – 22)and a total of56 crores in innovation grantsfor the same period. This number is relatively low compared to other top IITs like IIT Bombay and IIT Madras. Prof Bandyopadhyay, while talking about these statistics, explained, “Products/technologies/designs (that are patented) are developed, mostly, with the extramural funds(mostly provided by government funding bodies like DBT DST etc.)which faculty members secure. The 214 patents granted refer to similar products or designs developed using these funds, often called R&D funds. On the other hand, 56 crore rupees refers to the funds IITK received in the past three years to support startups at SIIC through incubator-related activities(from sources like government agencies, corporate donors, and CSR contributions). These two numbers are not correlated in our case. However, since R&D funds earned by faculty can technically be considered innovation grants, I believe some IITs might report these grants, along with direct incubator/startup funding, as the total innovation grant received in a year.”",
      "Another aspect of this is the commercialisation of patents, which measures the ability to earn money through the patents post-granting. IIT Kanpur lacks here as well, withonly seven commercialised patents in 2022 and a total of 18 over the past three years.“IIT Kanpur is conservative in its approach compared to other IITs,” he added. “IIT Bombay has a system where they initially give the patent at a lesser price with an agreement to finish the deal after the buyer pays a certain amount after a few years. This is well reflected as they have a combined 77 commercialised patents over the past 3 years. We, however, are not yet ready to have this kind of system. Our location puts us at a disadvantage as well.” Conversely, Prof. Braj Bhushan shared an optimistic view regarding the number of granted patents over the years: “Thenumber of patents grantedfor IIT Kanpur hasincreasedfrom64 in 2021 to 140 in 2023.Also, in a remarkable display of innovation, IIT Kanpur has achieved a significant milestone by achieving anexceptional licensing rate of around 14%.”",
      "In the financial support for innovation part, VC (Venture capitalist)  and FD (Foreign Direct)  investments are considered a metric that helps promote startups.The following infographics show the data for top IITs.Prof. Bandyopadhyay expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the submitted data, stating, “I am not sure how reliable the data is for these investments. The scrutiny is very uncertain, and the gap is significant.”",
      "Pre-incubation and incubation are crucial for fostering startups. IIT Kanpur has itsown incubation centre called SIIC.On asking about pre-incubation, “Pre-incubation is when you are preparing a startup before it becomes a company,” Prof. Bandyopadhyay explained. “I am strictlyagainst having a pre-incubation centreat IIT Kanpur as you cannot make startups sign an agreement that guarantees they will be incubated here after pre-incubation, and without agreements to stay with IIT Kanpur for incubation, promising startups may move elsewhere, leading to a loss of potential contributions to the institute’s innovation ecosystem. I experienced this when a student of mine went to incubate at IIT Bombay after getting initial support from IIT Kanpur. Our location works against us here as well.”",
      "Regarding the metric ofcredit courses offered in innovation, IIT Kanpur hasno such courses for UG.“Here we are lagging”, he admitted. “IIT Bombay has an advantage in this field. They have a dedicated centre for entrepreneurship. They operate with visiting professors’ practice and have a flurry of courses on entrepreneurship. We must pick up on this. I have recently started a course in this domain. It is a 600-level course that is open to UGs as well. It’s called Healthcare Ventures and Enterprises. I expect similar initiatives to be taken in the forthcoming time.”",
      "In conclusion, Prof. Bandyopadhyay offered his thoughts on the future of innovation at IIT Kanpur. “These rankings tend to derail the true aim of institutions, which is why I don’t fully support them. Look at BITS Pilani—their industry conversion rate is much better, and they don’t care about rankings. We should focus more on building a robust innovation culture than chasing rankings.”",
      "He also outlined some key initiatives that could help IIT Kanpur regain its footing: “First, we need to establish an emotional connection with our startups. They should feel a sense of belonging to the incubator, which is crucial for overcoming challenges. Second, we need to attract more investment by preparing startups for pitches and improving their standards. Third, we must showcase our startups better to the outside world. Unless we strengthen these fundamentals, we can’t expect to climb the rankings again.”",
      "In conclusion, NIRF gives a deeper insight into an institution, from teaching and graduation outcomes to research and development. While IIT Kanpur has demonstrated notable achievements in specific areas, such as maintaining a high faculty-to-student ratio and excelling in the number of students opting for higher education, there remains a need to strengthen its focus on innovation, research funding, and faculty recruitment to enhance its overall performance.",

      "This article is based on our conversation with Mr. Suresh, the Secretary of the Samiti.",
      "What do you think of when you hear the word “cooperatives”? If our guess is correct, Amul is the first name that comes to mind. Cooperatives—in simple terms, businesses that are owned and controlled by their members—are a familiar concept. However, you might not know that one such workers’ cooperative exists at IIT Kanpur. Shramik Vikas Sahkari Shram Samvida Samiti Limited, more commonly referred to asSamiti, is a workers’ cooperative predominantly made up of sanitation workers at IIT Kanpur. In this article, we explore its formation, operations, current structure, and the challenges it faces.",
      "In a previous Vox article titled “Prayas and Its Beginning” published on March 29, 2014, we spoke with Mrs. Vijaya, whose contributions were integral to the establishment of Samiti. The following excerpt from that conversation highlights her role:",
      "“Mrs. Vijaya Ramachandran, or Vijaya didi, as she is affectionately known, came to IIT Kanpur in 1968 with her husband, Prof. R. Ramachandran of the Physics Department. Few people know that she is not only the inspiration behind Prayas but has also actively fought for workers’ rights on campus. Even fewer are aware that she is the daughter of former President of India, Dr. R. Venkataraman.”",
      "After interacting with her housekeeper’s son, she realized that there was a stigma among faculty about their children studying alongside underprivileged students. This observation played a pivotal role in inspiring the concept of the Opportunity School. Her connections at the school helped her learn more about the workers’ families on campus and the issues they faced—particularly regarding their pay.",
      "Between 1988 and 1989, during her interactions with institute workers, she discovered that instead of receiving the officially mandated income of ₹32.60, they were paid a mere ₹16. Determined to address this disparity, she made it a focal point of discussions among the workers. This collective action eventually led them to mobilize and confront the contractors over the payment of minimum wages. Although the contractors temporarily agreed to the stipulated wages, the relief was short-lived, and workers continued to face problems such as irregular payments and unsafe working conditions. These persistent grievances eventually spurred the workers to consider forming a union, which led to the establishment of Samiti.",
      "As these issues persisted, the groundwork for forming a workers’ society was laid in March 1991 with support from Mr. Suresh, then working withNankari Samaj Kalyanin Nankari, Kanpur. He was approached by students and members of the campus community—including worker g Vishnu Shukla, a worker and Abhay Shukla, son of Professor A. P. Shukla. In March 1992, a workers’ society was officially established.",
      "Initially, the administration refused to assign any work to the newly formed society. Finally, in May 1992, the then Director, R. C. Malhotra, granted permission to form a workers’ cooperative—what we now know as Samiti.",
      "Acquiring work contracts has been a significant challenge for Samiti since its inception. The first type of work assigned to Samiti was sanitation; during a trial period, they were also given some maintenance tasks. Although construction workers constituted a significant portion of Samiti’s membership, they were not assigned construction projects. In 1993, the cooperative organized a hunger strike to pressure the institute into awarding them construction work. The protest, which saw the participation of 400–500 students, faculty members, and workers, eventually led the institute to agree to their demands.",
      "The campus’s student community has long supported Samiti and its workers. For example, in previous years, students in Hall 4 directly assigned painting work to Samiti workers—without any involvement from a contractor or the institute—paying them out of their own pockets. Later, the institute began recruiting manpower from Samiti for various labor tasks and even awarded the contract for the Hall 4 mess for a brief period.",
      "Unfortunately, over time, Samiti lost many of its work profiles and became limited primarily to sanitation work. The Hall 4 mess contract was revoked after a year when the hall administration changed. Further setbacks arose when an official from the Institute’s Works Department (IWD) modified a CPWD norm. According to Central Public Works Department (CPWD) norms, labor cooperative societies can undertake projects valued up to ₹50,000. However, a new institute policy stipulated that tenders would only be floated for contracts exceeding ₹75,000—effectively excluding Samiti from many opportunities, as most of their work fell below this threshold. Additionally, a new rule mandated that manpower could only be supplied by registered companies rather than cooperatives. These setbacks restricted the scope of the Samiti’s operations, forcing them to adapt to a narrower range of work.",
      "Samiti comprises two tiers of membership: general body members and a board of nine members elected from the general body. The general body is predominantly made up of sanitation workers, with a smaller number of mess and construction workers; approximately 8–10 of its members are women. To promote inclusivity, the board of directors has reserved seats: one for a Scheduled Caste (SC) representative, one for a member from the Other Backward Classes (OBC), and two for female members. Elections are held for the positions of chairman and vice-chairman, who represent Samiti. An appointed secretary handles tenders, finances, profit distribution, and other administrative tasks.",
      "Criteria for Joining Samiti:",
      "Those who meet these criteria must complete an application and pay a nominal joining fee of ₹50. Once processed, they can purchase shares at ₹100 per share, with a cap of 250 shares per person.",
      "Currently, Samiti handles the sanitation work for Halls of Residence 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, as well as for certain parts of the academic area.",
      "Samiti’s financial management follows a structured approach. A portion of the profits from contracts is distributed among the workers, but a significant part is reserved for future use. Specifically,",
      "During our conversation, Mr. Suresh mentioned that there were discussions about removing Samiti from the sanitation contract—a proposal that led to an uproar among the workers. A protest in 2022 involving nearly 1,000 people ensued, which ultimately resulted in the contract being retained by Samiti.",
      "When asked about the support from the administration and the student community, Mr. Suresh opined:",
      "“The institute has a problem with Samiti because it is a cooperative of workers. If we start getting work in all domains, the institute will have to address our collective demands. It’s easy to handle scattered, contract-based workers, but a united front like ours poses a threat to them. As for student cooperation, it has become almost negligible over the past few years. It’s a sad testament to our current condition. If this campus community doesn’t support us, we will soon be out of work.”",
      "Samiti’s journey at IIT Kanpur reflects the complexities of balancing institutional policies with the aspirations of workers seeking fair opportunities. While the cooperative has provided a platform for workers to unite and strive for better conditions, it has faced significant challenges in maintaining its position and scope of work. The evolving relationship between Samiti and the institute highlights broader issues surrounding labor rights, contract policies, and governance.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the lives of your professors beyond the lecture halls and labs? Were they just like us as students? What paths might they have taken if not for academia?",
      "Vox is back with Season 2 ofCandid Conversations with Professors @IITK, where our professors share their journeys, interests, and unfiltered insights into life at IITK and beyond.",
      "Join us for the fourth part of this series, as we sit down with Professor Dootika Vats from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. In this insightful interview, Professor Vats reflects on her academic journey, the life lessons she would share with her 20-year-old self, and her hobbies, from cooking to her love for cinema. She opens up about her favourite spots on campus, her passion for teaching, and the deep connection she feels with her students. An all time foodie, she also shares her culinary indulgences and her dream dinner companions. Read on to discover her inspiring philosophy, academic insights, and much more!",
      "",
      "I’d probably be jobless, homeless somewhere. If I were not a faculty member, I would probably be doing some corporate job in management-type situations. Not that I would have enjoyed it a lot. I would have just been doing that because I would have turned my brain off and said I would just do what people do. I chose this profession because I gave it some thought. If I were to choose a career at this point, though, I would be a terrible film writer, a horrible one. If you asked me when I was 11 or 12, I would be a cricketer. So, the answer is very different based on when I would decide.",
      "I would first tell my 20-year-old self to stop being so enthusiastic about everything in life and that bad things will happen to you. Don’t be so overly optimistic all the time. I’m still very positive, but I would probably just let my 20-year-old self know it will be challenging. So just be prepared for a little bit for what you know life has prepared for the future and that not everything can be solved with a positive attitude. Like kimannat mangne se, shiddat karne se, puja karne se aapko kuch milta nahi, aapko kaam bhi karna padta hai,vaise positive attitude rakhne se kuch milta nahi, aapko uske liye kuch karna padta hai.",
      "I used to love cricket when I was growing up, but unfortunately, for cricket, we needed more people, and boys and girls didn’t play together at that time. I find it so amazing to see young children, boys, and girls playing together these days. But actually, I’ve never played as much; I initially liked to play TT a lot, but nowadays, in the evenings and during the day, I have to work. I have also played tennis, especially during those 2 years of COVID.",
      "I also read as much as possible.  I love cinema and world cinema, so I love watching movies in theatres.  I love creating movies. I have a movie recommendations tab on my homepage, and I encourage all students to email me new recommendations. Whatever language you want, I can watch it. I like to cook when I have time. I sing horribly, but I like to sing in the confines of my house.",
      "Office and my home. Honestly, I don’t hang out much on campus because most places are crowded with students. I want a sober, nice, and quiet place. Sometimes, on the weekends, I sit outside CCD, go with a piece of paper or my iPad, and read something. Otherwise, favourite spot? It’s the tennis lawn.",
      "I am what you call a food snob. I am a very high-maintenance person when it comes to food. If I say I like pizza, people assume it’s Dominos. But it’s not Dominos. If you talk about a particular country, then it’s Italy. Italian food is the best food. I will not hear any arguments against it. Among Indian cuisines, I like Mughlai food a lot, and since I am a non-vegetarian, I eat everything that moves. I love Lucknowi Chicken biryani. I also love Chinese, Mexican, and Korean food a lot. I also love cooking, but I don’t get much time nowadays. On campus, there used to be a kathi roll shop. The guys moved somewhere outside now, and the rolls aren’t that good anymore.",
      "Oh, this one is tough because I hear something new and feel like this is campus lingo, but it turns out it is just something that this generation says, and it is not really specific to this campus. During my first year here, I was introduced to many lingos, and I know there’s something called Batti, as well as informal names of different departments. Once, I learned BT because somebody said “BT hui”. I kept wondering what that person meant because I wanted to act like a cool professor.",
      "“Master of None”.  I would like that.",
      "I come from an academic family. So, it’s sort of by default. But I knew I wanted to study more, for as long as possible. Again, coming from an academic family, doing a master’s or PhD was natural. I was a mediocre student all my life in the sense that I never studied and always got medium marks in high school and undergrad.  Then, in my master’s, I felt that I should become a bit more serious, and during my PhD, I felt that if I was doing it seriously, then I could do it.",
      "And then I also realised that I have some other life skills that, in general, academic people don’t have. I can read a room. I can have conversations with people. I can sell my work better because I know how to speak, talk, or make a story. So, I realised I had some soft skills that I could use, and I just had to work a little harder academically. But I had it in me. So I was like, oh, this seems fun, and I can do whatever I want. And be my own boss. I get to travel the world. I am also passionate and slowly became more passionate about the topics I was reading about. Yeah, so it was like a natural, organic way where I grew into the idea of being an academic. And I also like teaching a lot. I enjoy interacting with young people.",
      "A great perk of this job that I’ve found out now, having been at the job for a few years, is that I’m turning older. But your kids remain the same age. I mean, not you, but the concept of a student will always be that. And that’s quite interesting because, you know, I’ll always have access to what the youth is thinking, how they are feeling, what language they speak. They no longer say ‘suspicious’; they say ‘sus’. You know, so you have to keep in touch with that young energy. And it’s a great, great plus to have.",
      "I am also from IIT Kanpur. I grew up here, so I have seen massive changes since I was a kid. There is also a lot more construction on the campus now. I don’t think the campus has changed as much as my understanding of the campus has changed. As somebody coming from the American educational system where all majors are treated equally, at least in spirit, I was very against the idea of hierarchy among the departments. I thought there were different students with different capabilities. I don’t mean any offence, but slowly, what I’ve come to realise is that from the point of view of an instructor teaching a course, there is a reason that these preconceptions exist. I don’t believe in them. Though, I understand that they exist and why they exist. But this is not just limited to the IIT Kanpur. It’s a country-wide issue. I would love for majors and opportunities to be much more equitable. But sadly, we’re very far away.",
      "I travel a lot. I went to Mexico for the first time last month, and it was very nice. I’ve been to Finland also. We went up to the mountains at midnight, saw the Northern Lights, and trekked through the snow. I went to China in December of 2019, which was very interesting. I was in Hangzhou for a conference. It’s a fantastic city, a fantastic place, and it has great food again. Then I came back and went to London before returning. That was when I was accused of spreading COVID because I went to so many places. In December 2019, I went to 10 places.",
      "I strongly desire to travel, and Vietnam is at the top of my list. The country’s vibrant culture and amazing food are incredibly appealing. What excites me even more is the French influence on Vietnamese cuisine, a legacy of their colonial history, which I find fascinating and can’t wait to experience. Korea is another destination I’m eager to visit, and the motivation is purely for the food. I’d love to dive into the country’s culinary delights—just to eat and savour everything!",
      "So, this past summer, I was in the US for about a month. A few of my former students flew to where I was just to meet me. And we hung out; we went for a trek, went to a brewery, had a couple of beers, and just hung out with them. And I found that very, very rewarding. Just the idea that they found it valuable and interesting to dedicate some time off from work, fly to the city I’m in, and hang out with me. I was bowled over by the level of investment they’ve had in the time we have together. And it’s very rewarding for me to continue to invest in the students who work with me in such a way. I reinforce the feeling that the experience that they’ve had working with me has meant something.",
      "The challenge is that every year, students graduate. Students don’t realise that the faculty has to say goodbye to them every year. In the beginning, we emotionally connect with not every student but a couple of students in the classroom who might have reached out to us. Then, some students are working with us on projects, etc. We’re interacting with them. We’re sometimes getting to know their family problems. We’re sometimes getting to know their life goals and struggles—helping them make decisions, investing in their future, and writing letters of recommendation. Beyond all the technical ways we contribute, these personal connections matter. Students often leave, and if the relationship is good, they value it. But what students might not realise is that they mean a lot to us while they’re here. They move on, and we return to square one with a new student. This cycle repeats every year. It can be emotionally draining at times. I have this theory—if I reflect on the faculty I had as an undergrad, many seemed jaded and cynical, keeping their distance from students. I suspect I might become that person in 5-10 years, or at most in 20. One can manage only so much of this emotional cycle while maintaining one’s mental well-being. How much can we give? We invest. You come. You go. Occasionally, a few students will look back and acknowledge the effort. A few will genuinely value it.",
      "Every faculty member is different; not everyone feels the way I do. But for me, the hardest part is when students leave—especially those I work with closely. Meeting them for two hours every week, building that relationship, and then seeing them move on to, hopefully, a great future they’ve worked hard to achieve—it’s both fulfilling and challenging.",
      "I think many professors were probably just average students. In my opinion, the idea that you need Einstein-level brilliance or obsessive dedication to become a professor is entirely false. To be on this side of the table, you need perseverance, a lot of patience, and perhaps not being particularly good at—or interested in—other things that are often more appealing. Sure, there’s a subset of exceptionally bright professors, but I can confidently say that most students here are likely smarter than me. So, this notion that being a faculty member requires exceptional genius or Curie-like dedication is simply not true. What other myths are there? That we’re fun people. Some of us are, but our idea of fun is different. That’s partly because of age. Your definition of fun now will probably change when you’re older, too. Think about your parents—some are fun people, but their idea of fun is different. It’s just a matter of perspective.",
      "Pankaj udhas ke Gaane Lagao aur Suno, that’s also fun for a lot of people.",
      "I think many faculty possess a deep sense of empathetic understanding that students often don’t recognise. This empathy comes not only from our own life experiences but also from years of working with students. The challenges and worries you face aren’t new to us—last year, there were likely four other students with similar concerns. If you can overcome the initial intimidation or fear of approaching faculty, you might find this empathy accessible. Of course, not every faculty member is the same, but many of us are open and willing to connect in this way.",
      "If I could have dinner with three people, it would be Irrfan Khan, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Piku. Although, if we can squeeze in an extra chair, Jane Austen would be a lovely addition, too!",
      "Irrfan Khan’s death hit me hard. I started genuinely appreciating his brilliance later in life, and by then, he was gone. The magic of watching his films for the first time can’t be recreated now, and knowing there won’t be new ones feels heartbreaking. Harmanpreet Kaur intrigues me. She’s around my age, chose a different path, and is now the Indian cricket captain. I admire her drive but sometimes question her attitude. I’d love to understand her better over a conversation. Piku is an authentic character—probably the most accurate portrayal of an independent, working woman in her late 20s or early 30s I’ve ever seen in Hindi cinema. She reminds me of myself and many of my friends at that stage. I’d love to chat with her, though I’d have to catch up on Satyajit Ray films beforehand to avoid her judgment! And Jane Austen, of course, would add elegance, wit, and timeless insights to the table—how could I not invite her?",
      "I attended, listened, and understood the concepts in most classes during college, except for the morning ones. But I never did homework. In our college, there was no homework. There were only two exams – midterm (December) and final (April/May). I used to study only during those two weeks. But my approach was straightforward – understanding the concept was important. Until I understood, my mind would itch. But once I understood, I felt no need to study further.",
      "I wasn’t a hardworking student, though I cared about learning. I wish I had worked harder during my undergrad. I hadn’t learned how to work hard back then. This all changed when I started my master’s in mathematics in the US. I struggled a lot and was close to failing three classes. For the first time, I felt challenged in the classroom and didn’t know how to handle it. I didn’t have the habit of working hard or an interest in abstract maths. Finally, I withdrew from all my courses and decided I didn’t want to do this; I wanted to do something else.",
      "Then, I took CS and statistics courses, which I had never studied before. Statistics made sense because I could clearly see how to move from one step to the next. After months of struggling with maths, this gave me confidence. I felt that this could be done. However, I realised I was quite behind in statistics because other people were much more experienced.",
      "That’s when I actually started working hard. I took a loan for my master’s, worked two or three on-campus jobs, and had to complete courses—in just three semesters instead of four. So, I started working explosively. My mother still says, “I can’t believe you’re working from your own will,” because as a child, I was never like this. But that phase taught me how to work hard, something I had never done before.",
      "See, I am unique. It could be a mix of different characters. A little tinge of Parineeti Chopra from Hasee Toh Phasee. Then, a touch of Rani Mukherjee from Dil Bole Hadippa. And 20% essence of Piku, but not too much—just a little. And yes, Fleabag, maybe 5%. So, it’s like this mixture of all these characters combined somehow.",
      "There are a few guiding principles I follow. One is the idea of Karam karo, phal ki chinta mat karo, but in a different sense. I focus on doing the work without worrying about whether I’m good enough. I leave the evaluation to others and don’t stop myself from trying because I think I might fail. That’s how I approach my work life.",
      "In my personal life, I believe in maintaining a positive attitude— this can happen. Not blindly optimistic like our win is guaranteed, but rooted in the belief that good things can happen if you work honestly towards them.",
      "Another principle is that money isn’t a driving factor in most decisions—probably because I have enough to be comfortable. I focus on maximising joy and doing things that genuinely bring me happiness. That’s what matters most to me.",
      "I’m generally very impressed with the student body. Collectively, students are articulate, well-positioned, and principled. At the same time, there’s also a touch of mischievous, unprincipled behaviour, which honestly leaves me bewildered at times. Since this is a candid conversation, I’ll say it outright—why PDA? Why public displays of affection? From what I understand, you have rooms, don’t you? Sometimes, it gets so uncomfortable that I can’t even sit in the CCD. While showing affection is okay, other things should perhaps remain private. That’s something I find rather alarming.",
      "Beyond this, I’ve noticed how much stress students take about their future, as if every step they take will define their entire career. This mindset stems from the constant reinforcement over the years—the idea that excelling in the 10th and 12th grades, or JEE, guarantees a successful life. I find this perspective quite puzzling because I was never like that. I was much more carefree, so it’s hard for me to understand why students burden themselves so much.",
      "I’ve had so many positive interactions with students over the years and had the privilege of mentoring quite a few. In the last batch of MSc students who graduated in June, I taught them two brand-new courses—Data Science Lab and Statistical Computing. These were entirely new courses, so I was learning and figuring things out alongside them. It was a fascinating journey for all of us. When they graduated, something happened during the event that moved me so profoundly that I said, “Chalo shaam ko sab ghar aajao.” And just like that, there were 40 students in my tiny house! It was such a joyful experience, watching their journey from not knowing how to sit at a computer or what a URL box is to now landing data science jobs at reputed companies. For them, it was also a very special memory; for me, it’s one I’ll always cherish. Teaching those courses was incredibly challenging since it was my first time with that content, but seeing how far that gang of 40 came made it all worth it. It’s a memory I’ll hold close to my heart.",
      "One of the most underappreciated skills is learning to be a responsible citizen. Unlike questions and answers, which are right or wrong—life outside doesn’t work that way.In the humanities, there’s no absolute right or wrong, only well-articulated or less well-articulated answers. Similarly, real-life issues require empathetic understanding—considering where someone comes from and why they make certain decisions. Understanding that there is a right way and a wrong way, but it also depends on whose shoes you are wearing. Life is full of grey areas, and we need to embrace that nuance.",
      "I didn’t go to an IIT. I was thankful and never had that experience, but I had to suffer through spending time with many IIT graduates during my master’s and PhDs. My first advice is that we all should be very proud alumni of the institutes that have shaped and formed our formative years but don’t stay with that attitude once you leave this place. You should try to get away from this chip on the shoulder or the feeling of pride that I am better than people because there are different people and journeys.",
      "Another thing is that students, mainly when they come closer to graduation, start thinking that their next decision will shape their entire life. It’s a long journey. I am 34. I have friends with whom I went to undergrad and master’s and who are adapting their careers even now. The next thing you do should increase your life value in some way in either happiness, finance, or pride. But it need not be the final target of your life.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the lives of your professors beyond the lecture halls and labs? Were they just like us as students? What paths might they have taken if not for academia?",
      "Vox is back with Season 2 ofCandid Conversations with Professors @IITK, where our professors share their journeys, interests, and unfiltered insights into life at IITK and beyond.",
      "Join us in the 3rd part of this season, with Professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, as we explore his thoughts on the campus culture and college times, his favourite culinary indulgences, his love for the sea, and his dream dinner companions. We see how his father, as an agricultural scientist inspired him to get into academia and become a professor. In the interview, he discusses the joys of teaching, the challenges of fostering innovation in India, and the simple philosophy of living without regrets, among many other things. Read on for more!",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "When I have free time, I like to watch the most nonsensical movies and serials like Crime Patrol, something I can watch and forget—just to be distracted for an hour.",
      "Any favourite spot you have on campus?",
      "My office. If you track my location, you’ll only find me in my apartment and my office, and earlier at SIIC, I don’t go anywhere; I don’t venture on campus.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "All the departments’ nicknames, from Basbey to Hathora to Batti and many more, and Tempo High Hai. Some of the campus lingos infused are from outside Kanpur, such as bakaiti, etc. I recently learned from an Instagram post that it is Kanpur lingo.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I like the sea, so I would love to travel to some remote islands in Indonesia or the Maldives or Mauritius, and other places. And if I have company, then perhaps Antarctica. I don’t enjoy cities for traveling purposes.  But you know, with time, I have become a little less agile. So, strenuous treks nowadays, for more than a day, are a challenge for me, but in a day, if you ask me to make a 20-kilometer round trip, I’ll happily do it.",
      "Who is the character/personality you most resemble?",
      "One obvious person is my father; I’m a carbon copy of my father, and he was exceptionally curious. Just to give you a hint of what he used to do, he was an agricultural scientist. His research area was to develop a strain of rice that would grow in salt or deep water, both of which are bad for the growth of rice. So he did genetics and came up with a breed of rice that could grow up to a foot really fast. He was very excited about describing that to me when I was in 9th or 10th grade. That’s what shaped my imagination, and I’m just equally excited about Science. It could just be a trivial question, but if it is a question that has come to my mind, I generally like to go into its depth. I think like him, and I’m really easy-going and approachable. And I, too, am a foodie, in fact, a big-time foodie.",
      "Apart from that, I may be a little bit of Aamir Khan type. I’m a perfectionist, but I love to have fun.",
      "What is your favorite food?",
      "Mutton Biryani",
      "What cuisines do you enjoy?",
      "I pretty much enjoy all sorts of cuisine, but I am a little more into food with a good aroma, so I am just in the right place. Awadhi cuisine is perhaps the most aromatic, light cuisine. So I love that. After that, possibly Mediterranean cuisine. I like that. Unlike many people, I am not a huge fan of Italian food.",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive, or fictional, who would they be?",
      "A fictional person would certainly be Professor Shonku. I think none of you know this. He is the creation of Satyajit Ray, the great Bengali scholar, film director, and author. Professor Shonku was the character in his science fiction books. On the one hand, he was intense with Science but completely unorganized, too, and he did crazy stuff that would generally be on the side of the good.",
      "The dead person that I would love to be with would be Mendeleev. Just imagine the power of his imagination that he not only created the periodic table and placed the elements in their places but was also confident in saying that there would be other elements that would be placed here. That’s the power of logic. I am a huge fan of logic and its application.",
      "The living person whom I would like to watch across the table would be Amitabh Bachchan. Not just because I am a huge fan of his movies because I grew up with his movies, but also because I like his professionalism. He has many negative things about him, which I’ve read, but still, nobody can deny that he is a thoroughbred professional at the age of 82.",
      "What inspired you to get into academia?",
      "As I said, like my father, I was academically good when I was growing up, just like any faculty member here. My father was a very, very brilliant scientist, and he would often engage me in deep scientific discussion, disregarding the fact that I was not mature enough to understand. Some of his excitement just got transmitted. So, I thought that this might be a fun career. I was quite determined to be in academia from Day 0.",
      "If you weren’t a professor, what would your profession be?",
      "Perhaps a medicine doctor. I think that medicine is also about connecting the dots. Unlike surgery, I make a distinction. So medicine is like patiently listening to patients’ history, then connecting dots to figure out exactly what the limit might be, and then prescribing the medicine. I think that trait is very similar to what we do as bench scientists, where we study phenomena.",
      "What’s your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "Every night when I go to bed, I should not have any regret that I have done anything wrong on that day. That’s it.",
      "As a Professor, what are some rewards and challenges that you have experienced?",
      "The reward is love and recognition of people that I have worked with, particularly those who reported to SIIC, the companies that I helped create, which are currently valued at more than 500 crores, and I’m pretty sure they’ll acknowledge.",
      "To do Science in India is a challenge because your imagination goes much ahead of realities because there are way too many hurdles on your way, which are non-scientific; that is the challenge. Otherwise, I guess most faculty members of IIT Kanpur and I have a very good life.",
      "What would you say to your 20-year-old self?",
      "Whatever you are doing, try to be the best in it, whatever it is. If you are trying to learn exercise, try to be the best at it. If you are trying to drive the car, be the best at it. Whatever you do. Another thing that I have learned and realized much later is that fiscal prudence and financial planning are very important. If I were 20 years old again, I would have done much better financial planning today, knowing where things can go wrong.",
      "What is something students do that totally confuses you?",
      "Oh, you’ll not like the answer. The steadfast refusal of students to learn is actually very mind-boggling because IIT Kanpur has some of the smartest kids in the country. Still, they have this attitude that I don’t want to learn much of the things.",
      "What are the most valuable skills a student can gain from college?",
      "How to get along with people and how to interact with people.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "There was a student from the mechanical department, Btech. He wanted to take my course, but he had no biology background. He had to spend hours with me to learn because I teach an advanced-level subject. He was able to grasp it and then run with it, and then eventually, he’s doing biomechanics for his PhD. I really enjoyed it.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "Perhaps just one word, ‘transformation’, because I am a basic scientist, an absolutely basic fundamental biologist. Still, somewhere along the line, I was made the head of the SIIC, and now I think I have become more of a baniya than a scientist. There, I had to learn, at least, the technology aspect of a very broad domain, from aerospace to biotechnology to tribal technology. That has been a transformation, and that has actually transformed my life.",
      "What are some changes you have seen in IITK throughout your tenure?",
      "Well, IITK, over my tenure, has become increasingly more ambitious regarding research objectives and what it wants to achieve, which is on the positive side. Infrastructure quality has improved but students’ sincerity and honesty, on the other hand, has gone down.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "That we take ourselves too seriously. That’s not at all true. I tried to explain this to my students. In the classroom, I have a job. My job is to teach and assess whether you have learned what I taught there. Outside the classroom, I am just another person.",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "I was fun-loving, like if we talk about extracurricular activities, I used to be a Boy Scout. My scout group used to participate in national competitions, so I gave a lot of time. I grew up in a small town, so I did not have other kinds of opportunities like, you know, playing tennis or football, and athletically, I was never good. But scouting is something that I enjoyed, and I devoted a lot of time to it. Despite that, I did pretty well academically, but there was a phase during my Bachelor of Science when I was like many of you; academics took a back seat, a serious backseat. But the difference is that I took full responsibility for my mistakes and did not expect to be accommodated despite not doing what I was supposed to do. But after this, I never looked back, I must say.",

      "Recently, the Administration Section of IIT Kanpur issued an eviction notice to the residents of the Type-1A, Type-1B, and Dhobi Ghat accommodations of the institute, directing them to vacate the premises by December 17, 2024. The decision has initiated conversations across the campus, raising questions about its cause, impact, and future course.",
      "In order to give a thorough account, Vox Populi spoke with a range of stakeholders, including affected residents, administrative authorities, and others, in order to understand the implications of this notice.",
      "The eviction notice states that inspections conducted by two institutions, the Structural Engineering Laboratory, Civil Engineering Department, IIT Kanpur and Department of Civil Engineering, Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), identified critical structural issues with the Type-1A, Type-1B, and Dhobi Ghat accommodations.",
      "As per the notice, the report from the Structural Engineering Laboratory described these buildings as being in a “severely dilapidated condition” and noted that they “did not meet the seismic requirements of the present earthquake codes.”",
      "The notice also mentions a third-party inspection carried out by the Department of Civil Engineering, HBTU, which reportedly concluded that “the buildings are depleted and unsafe and also cannot be restored by retrofitting.” Based on these findings, the notice declares the structures “uninhabitable,” recommends their demolition and requires residents to vacate within 21 days.",
      "To understand the perspective of the Structural Engineering Laboratory, we reached out to nine professors and the Principal Security Officer of the lab. Of these, six professors stated they haven’t worked upon it or were unaware of any such investigation, while the remaining individuals have not responded so far.",
      "Additionally, we contacted the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DOIP) and Registrar of IIT Kanpur and also the Department of Civil Engineering at HBTU for their insights. However, we did not receive a response so far.",
      "On November 27, 2024, personnel including male and female SIS guards and staff from the IIT Kanpur Estate Office served eviction notices to the residents of the above-mentioned area. Additionally, banners were displayed, stating that the premises must be vacated within 21 days due to safety concerns. Warnings written in red ink on the walls said that electricity and water connections would be cut if the premises were not vacated by the stipulated deadline, as outlined in the notice also.",
      "Residents of the above-mentioned area include 17 Dhobi households, several security personnel, employees of the institute’s offices, departments and labs, etc.",
      "The Dhobi households residing in Dhobi Ghat have long provided end-to-end laundry services to thousands of students and staff on campus. The demolition of Dhobi Ghat would affect these services. In light of this, Vox reached out to the Dhobis to gather their perspectives on the matter:",
      "TheDhobis said that they were issued the notice twice, second time on November 30. The notice was also affixed to the doors and walls of their houses by the administration.",
      "The sudden issuance of eviction notices caused significant unrest among them. In response, they organized themselves and sought support from faculty members, students, and administration to help raise awareness about their situation.",
      "Following is a letter shared by Dhobis regarding the points raised by them:",
      "The primary concern raised by the dhobis was the need for an alternative housing and workplace arrangement within the campus if the institute required them to vacate Dhobi Ghat. They stated that moving off-campus would create significant challenges for their work.",
      "According to them, handling large volumes of clothes daily requires flexible hours and round-the-clock shifts, which would not be possible with fixed working hours. They also shared that relocating could reduce efficiency, compromise the safety of clothes, and increase service costs due to logistical difficulties. Additionally, they stated that they have no housing arrangements outside campus.To understand the issues raised by Dhobis better please refer to the following coverage of Vox Populi:Dhobighat: A Laundry List of Injustices – Vox Populi",
      "When we reached out to the other residents of the area, they expressed their concerns, stating,“We have no choice but to leave and seek alternative housing outside the campus and continue our work from there. Some residents have already left. We cannot request alternative arrangements as the institute is not obligated to provide them.”",
      "The following section of article is based on our conversation with the Dean of Administration (DoAd), Professor Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava",
      "Professor Vaibhav states that the eviction notice is not targeted at any specific group, including the Dhobis, but applies to all residents of the area, which also includes institute staff.",
      "Professor Vaibhav claimed that several Dhobis associated with the institute are already operating from outside the campus.The administration suggests that the Dhobis residing at Dhobi Ghat could follow a similar model.(In response to Professor Vaibhav’s claim, the Dhobis contended that most of those operating from outside the campus use the institute’s Dhobi Ghat for washing purposes.)",
      "He adds that the institute is ready to assist residents in making alternative arrangements outside the campus, should they request such support. Some residents (not Dhobis) might be getting the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as an alternative.(When asked, the Dhobis mentioned that no formal written assurances have been provided to them.)",
      "Regarding structural reports and comments mentioned in the eviction notice, Professor Vaibhav directed us to the DOIP, as the former did not have access to the reports.(When we reached out to the DOIP regarding this matter, we were redirected to the Registrar and the Deputy Director of the institute. Subsequently, we contacted both the parties, but have not received a response yet.)",
      "When asked about the future use of the vacated space, he emphasized that the institute’s priority order is: Students & Faculty > Staff > Other groups (e.g. Dhobis). The utilization of the area will be decided accordingly, based on the pressing requirements of the institute, whether for hostels, labs, or other facilities.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the lives of your professors beyond the lecture halls and labs? Were they just like us as students? What paths might they have taken if not for academia?",
      "Vox is back with Season 2 ofCandid Conversations with Professors @IITK, where our professors share their journeys, interests, and unfiltered insights into life at IITK and beyond. Here’s the first part—stay tuned for the next parts, featuring some of our other professors, with different stories!",
      "In part 2 of this season, we join Professor Amit Kuber from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, whose journey in life is marked by both passion and perseverance. From hosting impromptu game shows in his school days to becoming a mentor and a role model for his students, his commitment to learning and teaching has remained steadfast. In this interview, he also touches upon his love for music and Pokemon showdown, his affinity to infinity, and his desire to help students beyond the classroom.",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "Studious plus involved in extracurricular activities. I liked arranging game shows. I started this when I was in school. One time when 31stDecember was around the corner, I dug out some old clothes of my father and hosted a KBC-like tournament in our apartment. Even in my college times, students used to participate, and teachers used to be judges; it was fun.",
      "Any favorite spot you have on campus?",
      "One could say my office, I spend a lot of my time here. Spots depend on memories. When I stand on the balcony, I remember my first PhD student, Shantanu. Whenever it rained, we used to watch it from there.",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "I generally do not have much free time. But, I like to practice music, especially when I have company. Pokémon Showdown is my hobby. I used to participate in anime society tournaments here but haven’t gone in the last couple of years.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "People generally try to avoid using them in front of me though I had a couple of students who talked to me in that language. My first-ever student on campus, Harshit, told me a lot of lingos.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "I am not that old to think of my memoir, but it would be ‘Expinfinity-exploring infinity within’- Infinity has been a concept that has always fascinated me, and adding ‘exp’ or `exponential’ makes it grow faster.",
      "What are some changes you have seen in IITK throughout your tenure?",
      "The number of students has increased, but the number interested in studies has either remained the same or has declined. Many students from the Y13 and Y14 MTH batches went for higher education. Now that number has gone down to 1 or 2. That change haunts me. I try my best to do something about it.",
      "Also, the number of peacocks has decreased. I used to wake up because of peacocks when I initially came to the campus. Now I can hardly hear them. The size of the forest area has also decreased. The amount of infrastructure has increased, yet due to the large number of students, now there isn’t enough place to hold exams. The LHC staff is helpful, but the space is inadequate.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I haven’t thought of that. Even when I was studying abroad, my family supported me for food and accommodation, and I was very conscious about never spending a single pound unnecessarily. But whenever I go to any place, I try to live like the locals. I don’t like to go on tours. Places have to be explored being with the locals, not like a tourist.",
      "As a Professor, what are some rewards and challenges that you have experienced?",
      "The reward is that people open up. They share their problems & joys. If someone needs me to be present somewhere, I’m always there. The greatest joy is that I can be of some help, especially to students.",
      "As far as challenges are concerned, investing a lot of time and energy without worrying about consistent output is not encouraged. Also, as a researcher, I can’t put a tag on myself. In my master’s, PhD, and postdoc, I didn’t work only on a single topic. Finding an identity as a mathematician and switching between different roles on a daily basis has also been challenging.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "Recently a fresher told me that several students think that the instructors for large courses only teach while the rest of the work is handled by TAs and office staff. This is a myth since an instructor-in-charge has to work hard on all fronts–setting question papers, making seating arrangements, and handling administration, including email communication. They cannot completely rely on their TAs or office staff, since they need to own the responsibility for every mistake committed by any of their teammates!",
      "Students generally need to remember that professors are also humans. They have their own set of challenges and problems, and they are also trying to do something good for the students. Here, the reputation of a professor usually only depends on whether they grade well or not. Now that shouldn’t be the case. I feel like learning should be given more priority than just grading. The final outcome of a course is not a single letter that you get; it’s what you learn and the skills you develop in the process. Professors who are trying to be strict, say about grading or discipline in the class, have broader goals in mind. They want to see their students grow in multiple dimensions. Nobody wants to bother students on purpose. Maybe professors don’t communicate enough about what they are trying to achieve, but through proper communication, I feel that this problem can be resolved.",
      "Students have a lot of expectations. If you get zero marks and you’re expecting that I should pass you just because there are other people doing so, that is not fair. Some standards should be maintained. Sometimes we need to become a stone-hearted person while making hard decisions because students only learn through experience. Achievements should be celebrated, and poor performance needs to have repercussions in your life. We can’t all be too generous and spread positivity through marks!",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive or fictional, who would they be?",
      "I have watched a lot of television as well as movies. Ash Ketchum, who was the protagonist of Pokemon, would be the first. I wasn’t too young when I started watching it, but I followed it for 25 years. Ash likes to help people and is faithful, loyal and caring about his companions.",
      "I am also a big fan of Harry Potter, for he embodies the principle that despite loss, you need to stay on the path of truth. Even though they are fictional characters, I idealized them to some extent because of their qualities.",
      "Finally, Alexandre Grothendieck–the greatest mathematician of the 20th century–who basically lived mathematics.  My friend, Sayantan and I are also involved in a long-term project of translating his autobiography into English.",
      "What’s your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "“Irrespective of your circumstances, do your duty as you ought to!”",
      "Just push on, no matter what is happening. Asha Bhosle shared this philosophy several times in her interviews. I’ve also seen her in person. Her life was tragic, but she always says that whenever she stepped inside a studio, all her worries were outside, and only her voice was inside.  I try to follow that to the maximum extent possible.",
      "What is something students do that totally confuses you?",
      "There are so many things. The latest one would be students listening to seniors even if their advice contradicts that of instructors. That definitely confuses me.",
      "Also, I feel like the younger generation is not willing to commit to whatever aspect of life. Fear of commitment is something I feel is a big issue. I’ll tell you one story. I was watching Taskmaster- they usually have some team tasks. Here, 2 teammates were given 2 different letters of instruction, and they did not know what the other one got. One person was told to fill up a bathtub with as many objects as possible, whereas the other person was told to wrap the same bathtub. From the older team, one person actually finished filling up the bathtub with objects and then helped the other one wrap it. On the other hand, members of the young team kept obstructing each other. There was no coordination or synergy, and they did not think about the bigger picture. I went for a session organized by the Counseling service. One girl asked me how she should talk to her peers from the class? I think she was a PhD student. And she told me that even if she asks a simple question to the person sitting next to her, they are not willing to answer because they look at her as a competitor.Not everything is about competition, right?  You are living on campus. This is a residential campus, which means you have to live as a family. But people don’t do that. And there is very little cooperation. Everybody is living in fear. And that fear can be of the unknown. That can be fear of missing out, which you call FOMO. Why not make a choice and have the courage to face problems on the chosen path? If you realise that you made a bad choice, then you go back to a fork and make a different choice. People are willing to keep all the options open until the last moment possible and not commit. Yeah, it’s a simple commitment. I wasn’t talking about commitment in the context of relationships, but that’s also an issue!",
      "In the past, if you had an uncle working in a bank and he helped you to get a job in the bank, then you could be employed there until retirement. I’m not suggesting that. But if it gives you time to do something else, pursue a hobby, then that’s not a bad option. There are many singers and music directors who survived that way. For example, a lot of Marathi people like Shrinivas Khale and Mangesh Padgaonkar used to do some menial jobs, but those jobs gave them the opportunity as well as financial stability to pursue alternate careers. The best job is one where you are doing something you like, and somebody’s paying you for that.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "There are many.  One day, we had some elective course presentations going on until 2:00 AM. At that time, I got a call from two of my students who were working with me then. They said they were really excited because they found something new and -wanted to meet immediately. I asked them to come, and we discussed until morning. The residential campus has its perks, and sometimes the boundaries of time just vanish.",
      "Any advice for the student body?",
      "Be a good human. Things that you earn are not necessarily in terms of comfort, luxury or money; in the long term, those things don’t matter.",

      "A time capsule, akin to a time-travelling treasure chest, captures the essence of an era- our biggest dreams, core values and the milestones that define us—so that generations down the line can uncover and reflect on who we were and what we believed in.",
      "While this might come as a surprise to much of the campus junta,in 2010, as part of its golden jubilee celebrations,IIT Kanpur devised a unique way to safeguard its scientific heritage and glorious legacy— by preserving it for posterity in a time capsule. Remarkably, this was only the second such capsule created in India at that time. The then President of India, Smt. Pratibha Devi Patil, was herself present at the event.",
      "The director at that time, Prof. SG Dhande proposed the idea of this time capsule followed by the creation of a committee headed by Prof. SP Mehrotra and comprising Professors Ashwini Kumar, Ashok Mittal, Avinash Kumar Agarwal, Manindra Agarwal, Rajat Moona and Mr Phool Chand Gond as members.",
      "",
      "Breaking from tradition, gun-metal, also known as red brass, was used for the outer casing of the capsule instead of the usual stainless steel. The project, led by Professor Avinash Kumar, was primarily designed and executed by about 50 students from the institute in a Mechanical Engineering Lab with a budget of around 2.5 lakhs.",
      "To ensure the longevity of the contents, acid-free paper was used for storing printed information as regular paper, made from cellulose, can attract insects when exposed to water or oxygen. Most of the information was stored digitally and sealed with a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent interaction with oxygen.",
      "Addressing the common issue of data retrieval in time capsules, the team included external hardware- a 16 GB pen drive holding all the documents in digital format, along with a notebook computer equipped with the necessary software and cables to access the data in the future.",
      "The 3-foot long capsule is composed of two sections—an inner cylinder measuring 6 inches in diameter and 17 inches in length, and an outer shell that encases it. This shell is made up of three separately cast segments, which were assembled after the contents were securely placed inside. At the time of burial, the total weight of the capsule was approximately 285 kg.",
      "Several interesting things were placed inside the capsule after 6 months of deliberation, in both hardware and digital form. These included photographs collected over 50 years, an aerial map of the institute, a replica of the President’s Gold medal, copy of statutes, ordinances and acts, a weekly menu of a student hostel mess, information about birds spotted in campus, annual reports, R&D publications, copy of ‘courses of study’ booklet in microfilm, minutes of first and hundredth Senate meetings and the Board meeting, and the IITK movie of 2009, among others.",
      "If you haven’t yet guessed the location, let us break it to you. You might have wondered about the large white rock when passing through the Main Auditorium. Perhaps, you have even taken a picture there, unaware that this marble rock, weighing around 10 tons and transported from Banswada, Rajasthan marks the spot where the Time Capsule is preserved. The capsule encapsulates the Institute’s rich history and the aspirations of our generation, embodying our commitment to shaping the future with our unique vision and ideals.",
      "As we reflect on the treasures buried in 2010, one can’t help but wonder—if a time capsule were to be buried today, what new milestones, achievements, or symbols of our era would we choose to preserve?",

      "",
      "Have you ever wondered about the lives of your professors beyond the lecture halls and labs? Were they just like us as students? What paths might they have taken if not for academia?",
      "Vox is back with Season 2 ofCandid Conversations with Professors @IITK, where our professors share their journeys, interests, and unfiltered insights into life at IITK and beyond. Here’s the first part—stay tuned for the next parts, featuring some of our other professors, with different stories!",
      "In part 1 of this season, we sit down with Professor M.K. Harbola to dive into his world outside academia. From his unique approach to teaching quantum mechanics to his passion for jogging, reading, and daily exercise, Professor Harbola shared a glimpse of his multifaceted personality. Reflecting on the evolution of his teaching philosophy, the joy of connecting with students, and the challenge of being a “tough grader” with a purpose, he offers candid thoughts and refreshing insights into the experiences that shape his journey.",
      "What character or person does your personality resemble most, if any?",
      "You should tell me.I don’t analyse my personality. Because I’m still evolving. I keep changing as a person, a researcher and as an educationist. So it’s very difficult to say. You will also realise as you grow older that you are evolving continuously. You do not resemble somebody all the time.",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive or fictional, who would they be?",
      "I don’t have any preferences, and I don’t believe it would have been good only if a specific person came. It’s not like I’ll go out with Einstein; he will give me knowledge and all. Knowledge I’ll collect anywhere. It should be a fun interaction. So it could be anybody, certainly not a criminal or gunda, but anybody nice to talk to because every person gives you joy, no matter what. At your age, you think it would be fun only if you go with certain people. But it is not like that. The person accompanying doesn’t matter. If you have a wide range of topics to talk about, you can enjoy with anybody. It’s up to you what you extract out of the conversation.",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "I jog every day, swim every day, go to gym every day, and read a lot.",
      "What do you like reading?",
      "A lot of things, as long as it is creative. Right now, I am reading “Code Dependent”; it’s about how AI affects life and its negative and positive shades. I also read the book “Invention of Surgery”, so that’s a wide range of reading material. In the fictional genre, I read a lot of Hindi literature.",
      "What inspired you to get into academia?",
      "It is interaction with people; It helps you grow;  and there are many more things. Number one is creating knowledge, and number two is sharing it and the joy of doing it. So, young students may swear a lot and tell many things about me, like a tough grader and all, but I enjoy interacting with them. What matters to me is that some student looks back after a few years and says that he gave us good stuff; he gave us a different perspective.",
      "So in your courses, like quantum mechanics, students find it difficult when they’ve just arrived after giving jee. What do you have to say about that?",
      "So, when the quantum mechanics course was first introduced, I taught it for the first time. It would have been very easy for me and the students if I had gone there and started the Schrodinger equation and solved some problems with it, and that way, I would have finished it. However, students would not get anything from that and would have no perspective. So, I made a very unique course. I did not touch any elaborate equations for about half the course. I tried to show them different phenomena, what they are, and how a new theory is needed to understand it all. So their expectation should be to come to a place where they can learn a lot. In doing so they will face new challenges, and they’ll also have to put in a lot of work. But, their expectation is that this is a physics course and it is approached with a JEE style of problem-solving.",
      "So the challenge is how do you get that across to the students? What is being taught is the way real things happen, and this is what is useful, and this is what you have to work for. So first, I tried to tell students that the world is quantum mechanical, not classical. I got them to write essays on how classical physics is a good approximation to quantum mechanics. After doing all this, I held a presentation of their essays in L20, spending 4-5 hours in the evening. I arranged snacks for everyone. But nobody will tell you this part. After doing so much, students don’t appreciate it. They only say that I am a tough grader. My teaching was not hard; it was different.",
      "I’ll give you a similarity. Based on gender or other differences, people are treated as inferior. But in reality, they are just different, not superior or inferior. And you can learn from each other. Similarly, my courses are different because they give you a new perspective. I work really hard for it. They look tough because students are not willing to accept the difference. Nobody talks about the good aspects.",
      "The second time I taught this course, I got a play organised. That play was attended by 1000 people. I had to work a lot for that and spend a good amount of the institute’s money. I got the play translated into Hindi. This was the first-ever staging of the play in Hindi. But students didn’t see the play as something extraordinary, nor did they appreciate that they were in such a course. This disappoints me.  But I am willing to take on the challenge and will continue working this way.",
      "When I taught this course for the first time, I worked for 10 months, 7 days a week, 10-14 hours a day, to develop the material for the course. But the response came that I taught a very hard course. Come and sit in the class and see. Nobody will tell you that I gave an A even at 25-30 marks. So, this is very disappointing in the sense that these same people are the leaders of tomorrow. But I’m not going to get discouraged. Out of them, even if 5 or 10 understand it, it’s fine.",
      "If you weren’t a professor, what would your profession be?",
      "Oh, surgeon. You will be interacting with people and doing things. But not an administrator.",
      "Any favourite spot you have on campus?",
      "This campus is so beautiful. On top of the new engineering science building or faculty building, you get a beautiful view. Earlier, I really loved going to the backside of the campus, behind Hall 13 and Hall 10. That used to be a beautiful place, where in winter there used to be vapours coming up and winter birds used to be there. It was a low-lying water area. And I think as students you should go around and see a lot of such things.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "Many of my fellow students and I learnt a lot of them and gave some new ones when I was a student. A fair number of them are used even now—some I don’t like, like fakka. One is chaapu, which was also used in our time. Baikaati is dadagiri, and someone who did very well is known as baikaat. Another is the maggu and bulla session. These are what were there during our time as well.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I like traveling a lot in India because there is a lot to see. Next, I want to visit Ajanta-Ellora, one place I’ve not been to, or the Meenakshi Temple and Rameshwaram. In the northeast, there is a place I’ve been to near Imphal, Loktak Lake, a freshwater lake. For now, I am exploring India. If I am going abroad, then I’ll go to Southeast Asia. It is culturally much more interesting.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "It’s not a myth but a perception that Professors do not have a human side. Students think profs are givers – of lectures, tutorials and they just give us grades. They don’t interact; they do not see us as fellow human beings, but if they interact, they will find we are also human beings; we have worked hard, we have gone through a lot of things, maybe what you will see as you grow; that’s why this is a residential campus so that you grow up as a citizen. The human aspect of students is gone because, in the years prior to coming here, they were only doing problem-solving.",
      "Teaching and Grading is just one part; the other part is the human aspect. It’s a place with an environment; everybody is part of it, and we professors, students, and staff are all part of it. It will make things much better if we all see that. Otherwise, I can just come and teach; students will study, I will give grades, and they will swear, that’s it.",
      "What would you say to your 20-year-old self?",
      "What is interesting is what he would tell me. He would say to keep going the same way but reduce the times you’ve made a mess of things. I’ll tell him this: Live the way you should live and enjoy. The rest is not in your control.",
      "Now, he would tell me… you’ve grown up well.",
      "Maybe I’ll ask him- Have I been fair to you? Have I been how you thought I would be?",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "I was like any other student. I had fun. I made fun of profs, I imitated them, but I also talked to them. You should have fun at your age, but everything has an upper limit. I did everything, even bunked classes, but within a limit. I have bunked class and gone to see movies, too.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "Not from here; this is one of the places I come from. There was a new engineering college, so I visited and took some lectures. Then, 7-8 years down the road, I got an email that said, “You don’t know me, but you took some lectures for us, and that inspired me, and I am leaving Cambridge for a PhD, and I remembered you.” No better reward than this.",
      "From here, there was one student; once, there was a discussion in the class on how you want to grow and what you want to become, so he said I want to become like you.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "People around me.",
      "What’s your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "People around me.",
      "Is there anything you want to say to the student body?",
      "Live your life to the fullest, enjoy, and be happy. I would like to see you do great in the next 10 years. Be honest and be caring to others. One complaint or observation is that students who have gotten advantage of the old value system have now started questioning it. It’s not good. There is no escape from what is to be done, and that is being positive.",

      "This article comprises general content about the campus life and culture. It is not an investigative report.",
      "Bhandi – The art of drinking.",
      "Have you been in that senior’s room, listening about how ‘liquid luck’ is the best way to make connections, and how social drinking is the way to go? Fast forwarding many nostalgic semesters, did we really socially drink, or did it simply lead to many nights in which we’re not quite sure what really happened?",
      "Well, what exactly does it mean to bebhand?And what do we mean by social drinking? How can we quantify it? What amount of the ‘liquid luck’ do us muggles need to drink to be addressed as abhandsomeone? Well, the urban dictionary doesn’t really say anything about that, and sorry to disappoint you, but if we’re being real here, there isn’t a good answer to that. It’s very subjective- a person can have a couple of shots and go flying and another might have an entire bottle and still see the world standing still. Everyone has their own capacities. So, how do you know what you can take and what works for you? It’s like you’re thrown into the sea, blissfully unaware of even how to swim.",
      "There are many different ways you can do it – what, when, why, how, and with whom gives rise to infinite possibilities. Broadly however, we can look at drinking in two major categories – Social drinking, and Binge drinking. Social drinking refers to moderate alcohol consumption in a social setting. Binge drinking, on the other hand, involves consuming excessive amounts of alcohol in a short period, often leading to impaired judgment, memory loss, and increased risk of harm.",
      "Let the Numbers talk",
      "We, at Vox Populi, conducted a survey to understand the trends and culture of drinking, with 700+ responses from the campus community. Surprisingly more than half of the respondents have open conversations about alcohol in their household. On the other hand, a majority of people stated that despite having open conversations about it, consuming alcohol isn’t acceptable in their family. Among all the respondents, 50.6%(358)have already tried alcohol, 46.8%(331)have not, and 2.7%(19)are not comfortable sharing this information.",
      "Amongst the respondents who have tried alcohol, most of them (90%+) started off in a social setting, either with close friends, at a social event like a club party/event, or with their family members. The amount consumed in a session varies from person to person, and among the respondents who have tried, the frequency isMonthly or lessfor 65%(230),2-4 times a monthfor 13%(46),Neverfor 12%(42)andMore often that 4 times a monthfor the rest. 60% of the UGs have tried alcohol either before or after coming to campus or aren’t totally opposed to trying it in the future. The number is the same for PGs. It is also worthwhile to note that only 7% of the UGs had tried it before coming to campus, while for PGs it was around 30%.",
      "Out of the 330 respondents who haven’t tried alcohol yet, 55.5%(183)of them cited the reason to be their Morals, 16.1%(53)cited Health, 10%(33)preferred to avoid risky situations, and 7.9%(26)attributed it to their family. The rest, 10.5%(35), cited various reasons including money, high chances of getting addicted, and not having any incentive to try. Most of them (84.6%) do not plan on trying it in the future as well.",
      "What does our campus community have to say about drinking?",
      "“Alcohol is only harmful in two ways.",
      "This only reflects the lack of maturity which can be overcome by getting out of your shell, learning more about the world around you and simply learning to be a responsible person towards everyone. Also learn to enjoy the company of people without alcohol; it’s just a fun thing to consume sometimes. Seek professional help if you’re in deep sorrow, alcohol does nothing.”",
      "“Just love the talks after getting a bit drunk and I think it brought me closer to my true friends too. A thought I wrote down while drunk reads-“You are your filters- I think I want to say that the idea or the existence of a person constitutes and is constituted by the information which he values. The world is noise, and what you filter out of that noise is your reality. Basically, you are what you see, and you see what you choose.”",
      "I think I went quite deep with that shit.”",
      "“There should be awareness on drinking. People should know that drinking is harmful, whatever be the quantity. And one should only drink (responsibly) if they feel like; not because of peer pressure or to look ‘cool’.”",
      "“In this world nothing is a bad habit, the rules what we made will decide the things. Remember, everyone has their own set of rules and ethics.",
      "May be ur ethics book is large that doesn’t mean everyone’s has to be large, someone’s has just one line.”",
      "“Jab tak jeevan sahi chal rha ho, jo mann me aaye krro.",
      "By jeevan I mean, tumhare academic goals, career goals, relationship goals, economic stability and health ofc.Inside of campus, the stigma of “drinkers” is a well reduced thing which has its pros and cons, but as long as the person is self-aware, jo karta hai krne do:)”",
      "Some Myths and Facts:",
      "Myth:- Small amounts of alcohol are good for you.",
      "Fact:- According to WHO, ‘No level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health’.",
      "Myth:- You are allowed to drink inside your hostel rooms.",
      "Fact:- This is False. You are not allowed to consume/possess alcohol anywhere on campus.",
      "Myth:- Women are less likely to consume alcohol than men on campus",
      "Fact:- According to the survey, the percentage of men and women who have consumed alcohol is almost the same.",
      "Myth:- It’s acceptable to drink over the age of 18 all over India.",
      "Fact:- The legal drinking age is actually 21 in most Indian states, including U.P., 25 insome and are actually variable.",

      "Disclaimer: This article represents the first part of an ongoing story. We have reached out to  the administration and other individuals not represented in this piece. Upon receiving their perspective, it will be included in a follow-up to ensure a more comprehensive account of the matterOn the 8th of September, the Dramatics Club was set to perform two street plays one of which was titled, “Asteen Ka Saanp”. First staged in 2015, the play has since been showcased multiple times on campus and in competitions, including Antaragni 2015 (where it won a Bronze medal). However, when the club attempted to stage it again this time, the Administration prohibited the performance. Read on to find out what led to the play’s cancellation.",
      "Background",
      "The Dramatics Club was set to perform their Nukkad on September 8th, as announced in an email sent to students on the evening of September 7th. The email outlined the themes of the two plays for the event, includingAsteen Ka Saanp, which read “The Natak sheds light on the growing concern of Islamophobia in India, where prejudice and discrimination against the Muslim community are on the rise. We explore how third parties, including political groups and media, exploit this issue for profit and power, fueling hatred and division for their own gain.”",
      "The next day, Gymkhana representatives received multiple calls from students raising concerns that the play might hurt religious sentiments. Along with voicing objections, some callers reportedly cautioned the representative against potential repercussions including the possibility of filing an FIR against the representative.",
      "Shortly after these calls,the Director conveyed to a Gymkhana Representative that objections had been raised against the theme of the play and that theNukkadcould not proceed due to safety concerns.",
      "The representative suggested that the wording in the email may have led to a misunderstanding, giving rise to the objections. When the representative mentioned that the students from the dramatics club sought clarity on why their play was cancelled, the Director invited students, including representatives from both the Gymkhana and the Dramatics Club, to meet with him for a resolution.",
      "During the meeting, the representatives attempted to explain the script and flow of the play to the Director. Reportedly, the Director felt that the play portrayed facts selectively. He instructed them to add lines to the script. He also asked them to send an apology email clarifying the play’s content to the campus community prior to the nukkad’s performance. Following back and forth between the director and the students, the meeting concluded with the Director suggesting that, the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA), the Associate Dean of Student Affairs (ADSA), and two Gymkhana representatives, review the script and submit their recommendations the following day.",
      "After receiving the recommendations, permission was still withheld, stating that sensitive topics should be presented in a sensitive way. When the representatives expressed their grievance regarding the decision, the Director held another meeting with Gymkhana and Dramatics Club representatives. Another group of students present at the meeting conveyed the concerns of those who had objections to the play. According to the students objecting to the play, outrage was guaranteed if the play proceeded. The discussion concluded with the Director instructing both groups to discuss the script, stating that the play would only be allowed if both the parties agreed to the revised script with the President and the Chairperson moderating the meeting.",
      "Later that evening, a meeting was held between the objecting students and the representatives. The objecting students began by expressing their concerns about the use of the term “Islamophobia” arguing that it misrepresented and defamed the country. One participant stated that vast majority of people in the country are not Islamophobic, and the play is generalizing an exception. The students also accused the Dramatics Club of defaming the country in their dialogues, claiming the play was hurting national sentiments",
      "In response, the Dramatics Club representatives contended that challenging prevailing stereotypes would naturally involve dialogues and depictions that might make some uncomfortable. They argued that the play was a satire on Islamophobic attitudes, meant to make people think critically, not to hurt anyone. Much of the meeting was spent with the Dramatics Club providing context to the dialogues and citations for the figures used in the script.",
      "Ultimately, no resolution could be reached and thus the play couldn’t be performed.",
      "Fallout",
      "Simultaneously, social media posts appeared, offering commentary on the play’s content. These posts described the club as left-leaning and disrespectful toward Hindu sentiments, while also singling out individuals from the club. Club members reported being called names and labels by their peers following the release of these posts. However, the said post was later taken down.",

      "In May this year, Hall 13’s Hall Executive Committee (HEC) completed its first tenure. As the next elections for HEC are around the corner,  we explore the development of HEC, covering its initial setup, challenges, and recent changes. Vox spoke to hec members, alumni and conducted a survey to look at election problems, the unique block-wise system and reviewed past efforts to establish a functional HEC.",
      "A HEC is a committee that represents the collective views of the residents, coordinates with administration and manages the day-to-day functioning of the hall. It handles the hall budget; and arbitrates intra-hall disputes, if any.",
      "The demands for creating an HEC in Hall 13 gained traction due to various issues faced by its residents. These issues included (but weren’t limited to):",
      "The impetus for change was catalysed by a group of PG students from the design department, who had seen how HECs functioned at other halls. A PG student stated, “Almost all PGs had joined in,” emphasising the broad-based support for the initiative. Discussions with hall administration were carried out, but they proved inconclusive.",
      "There were also previous attempts by UG Y22 students after COVID-19 to establish an HEC. However, their attempts were shut down with the reasoning that their tenure would be too short, given the time it takes for campaigning and elections.",
      "Initially refusing their demands last year, the hall office and wardens eventually agreed to the formation of an HEC for Y23s after the Students’ Gymkhana got involved.",
      "The HEC of Hall 13 follows a block-wise structure, with each block (A to F) having two positions for student representation, assigned randomly. In 2023-24, two wings in the F block were allocated to MDes students, so one HEC post, Mess Secretary, was reserved exclusively for them. Additionally, residents from each block can only vote for the two posts designated for their respective block.",
      "Also, differing from other halls, there is an absence of a president within the HEC. When asked about the rationale behind this distinctive arrangement, Sambhav (a Y23 HEC member from MDes.) responded, “We aimed for a structure that ensures equitable representation of every block, so we can prioritise the concerns of each block.”",
      "This framework was created by students during discussions with wardens, the hall office, and Gymkhana representatives. When asked about the same, Dhwanit Balwani, ex-PSG, said, “First-year students are new and don’t have administrative experience. They don’t know how to run a team of students together while leading as a president. They don’t have enough calibre for such a task. This can also result in one person having irregular power over others.”",
      "Dhruv Misra, the current PSG, stated “The role of Hall President involves a significant amount of responsibilities, and it’s unfair to expect first-year students to be aware of all the nuances at the very outset. The responsibilities of the Hall President were dealt with majorly by Dhwanit (as PSG) and I (as Convener, CoSHA). There is no specific representative for Hall 13 in CoSHA, but all the concerns of the Hall are put forth by the Convener, CoSHA in the meeting, and since it is open to the entire campus community, the entire HEC or any individual from Hall 13 can attend.”",
      "In our survey, 68% of Hall 13 residents largely agreed with Dhruv regarding not having a Hall President.  Vox also attempted to reach out to the ex-Warden, Prof. Mohite, however, he was unavailable for comments.",
      "The HEC elections, conducted by the Election Commission in October, took place two months after the Y23s arrived. The code of conduct was enforced immediately, followed by campaigning and a soapbox. Mess, Maintenance, and Sports secretary positions saw the highest nominations, with four contestants each. Cultural secretary had two candidates, while accounts and common room had one each.",
      "On Election Day, a technical error in the online polling portal led to uncounted votes. A second round of voting using paper ballots was held the next day, but the turnout was significantly lower.",
      "From the survey of 220 responses, 51% voted in both elections, while 23% did not vote at all. Among non-voters, 30% felt their votes wouldn’t matter, and 28% cited a lack of awareness and transparency.",
      "NOTA won against candidates for Maintenance and Accounts, leaving these positions vacant. In the first HEC meeting, it was decided that one member would manage three positions, with no additional nominations, unlike other halls.",
      "The survey collected responses to gauge people’s impressions of how effectively the students believed the HEC could conduct its duties given its unique characteristics.",
      "When the GBM was asked about their views on the block reservation system, 51% of the respondents opposed it. We then asked whether residents felt the HEC was biased towards one hall. Notably, nearly 44% of participants perceived such a bias, indicating a significant concern. Additionally, one of the residents mentioned, “The HEC closes the mess citing pest control whenever there is hall day in any of the parent halls,” and various others shared similar sentiments, suggesting potential influence from the parent halls.",
      "Next, to assess the accessibility of the HEC to the residents, we asked them to rate it on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not accessible at all and 5 being very accessible. The responses varied widely, ultimately averaging out to a score of 2.72, highlighting a significant disparity in residents’ perceptions of HEC accessibility.",
      "When questioned if the HEC was able to make an impact in their tenure, 73% of people denied the notion. They pointed out the problems of washing machines not being solved despite continuous requests, and the quality of mess food fluctuating among other reasons.",
      "We also sought residents’ opinions on two major HEC initiatives: the Diwali Celebration and the Hall Day Celebration.",
      "The Hall Day Celebration received mixed reviews. Some responses pointed out issues with management by HEC and some deemed the event expensive. One respondent pointed out, “The Hall day celebrations created a lot of controversies and even fights within the hall residents and HEC. Even within the HEC all the members were not in favour of Hall day. It was somehow forced on the Hall residents.“",
      "The Diwali Celebration received mainly positive reviews. With people calling it a better initiative than hall day. One respondent noted, “The HEC did an exceptional job organising the event, setting it apart from all other halls. From the morning Diwali Pooja to the evening firecracker show, everything was magnificent, attracting large numbers of attendees from other halls.”",
      "Note:The following part of the article is based on discussions with :",
      "Deepankur Kansal,Y18, an HEC Member of Hall 13",
      "Vedaant Sikka, Y18, President, Students’ Gymkhana 2021-22",
      "The first UG batch residents of Hall 13 were the Y18 batch. Initially, Hall 13 faced several issues, mainly regarding basic amenities in the mess. This led to a need for a Hall Executive Committee (HEC) to improve living conditions. Many students approached the Hall Warden, and it was decided to establish an HEC, but without elections.",
      "The initial structure had each of the 36 wings selecting a wing representative among themselves. These 36 representatives were divided into four groups of nine, focusing on Mess, Maintenance, Sports, and Cultural activities. However, this structure faced difficulties as no one had signing authority for any of these domains.",
      "To address this, the size of each group was reduced from nine to two, giving these individuals the authority to make decisions based on discussions with the entire group. This change reduced the total number of representatives from 36 to 8. Although this structure functioned better, many members lost interest over time, and the number of active members dwindled. By the end of the HEC’s tenure, some financial issues in Hall 13 led the warden to decide against having an HEC in the future.",
      "When the Y19 batch arrived, they were not allowed to form an HEC. However, in November, a new warden, Professor PM Mohite, took charge. The President, Students’ Gymkhana and the Convener of COSHA resumed discussions with the new warden, successfully advocating for the formation of an HEC. This time, members were nominated based on interviews rather than elections, and notably, the HEC did not have a president.",
      "Shortly after its formation, a mid-semester break happened, and as students did not return to campus due to COVID, limiting the HEC’s activities.",
      "Later, during the tenure of Vedaant Sikka, the Convener, CoSHA for 2020-21,the initiative to form an HEC for the upcoming batches (Y20 and later) was takenl. A model for the same was discussed in the CoSHA and a proposal was passed which suggested the following:",
      "Overall, it was stressed that Hall 13’s concept differed from other UG halls, focusing primarily on improving facilities and organising cultural events like Hall Day v/s the role of parent UG HECs which additionally involves participating in GC & other inter-hall events.",
      "However, due to uncertainties about the residence and the late arrival of the Y20 and Y21 batches, the formation of the HEC did not work out as planned. Furthermore, the structure was not carried forward for subsequent batches of Y22 and Y23.",
      "Vedaant believes that a better structure to implement for HEC would resemble his proposal.",
      "He also discussed how the mixing of undergraduate and postgraduate students in the halls, initially implemented as a temporary measure due to a crunch in hall capacity, is not the ideal model, due to their fundamentally different expectations from halls. With the recent increase in hall capacity, he emphasised the need to revisit this arrangement and reduce UG-PG mixing in halls to the extent possible",
      "As this tenure of the Y23 HEC has concluded, some faith has been built that freshers can handle their own affairs. The current HEC has vowed to ensure that the next HEC is formed and a transfer of power takes place smoothly. They have secured support from the warden for future tenures. Starting next year, any vacant HEC positions could be filled through the standard renomination and interview process in consultation with the warden.",
      "With a new HEC set up in Hall 13, questions come up about how to ensure fair and adequate representation. Considering the significant presence of postgraduate students in other UG halls, should their representation be proportional to their numbers there as well? Similarly, does the precedent set by Hall 13 suggest that fresher undergraduate girls should have representation in the HEC of Hall 4? These are questions that merit further investigation.",

      "Cycle repair shops located in front of hostels have been a vital part of campus life for a very long time, providing essential services to the community every day. However, recent developments have put these shops at risk, as vendors have been asked to vacate their spaces. In this article, Vox delves into the current structure of the working of these shops, explores the challenges in their functioning, and examines the changes proposed by the estate office. We also spoke with various stakeholders to understand the impact of these developments on both the vendors and the campus community.",
      "There are two types of cycle shops on campus: those that rent shops through Estate Office tenders and are officially allowed to sell bicycles, and those operating with a vendor’s pass issued by the SIS Office, which only permits them to repair bicycles within the campus. The former can be found in various locations, including the Old Shopping Complex and MT, while the latter are located at the entrances of different halls, with eight such shops in total. Due to their proximity to the hostels, the vendor shops tend to be more accessible to students. Vendors with a pass are permitted only to arrive in the morning, repair bicycles throughout the day, and leave campus with their tools by evening.",
      "Vox spoke with a cycle shop owner near a hostel to understand the process of obtaining a vendor pass. The owner explained that they usually receive a form from the security office, which requires signatures from the hall’s warden and two other professors before being submitted to the Estate Office. This procedure has been in place for as long as these vendors have been on campus, some for up to 20 years. A vendor’s pass costs ₹360 per year, whereas renting a shop is much more expensive. Although these vendors typically operate under passes, over time, they have built permanent sheds and have begun selling second-hand bicycles, which is not permitted under the pass.",
      "A cycle shop owner at the Old Shopping Complex, who has the shop tender, noted that his earnings significantly declined after COVID-19, especially when outside vendors were allowed on campus during the peak student arrival period (July-August). He told that his specialized gear repair skills attract off-campus customers and have kept him in business, unlike other shops that closed due to lack of expertise. He also mentioned that the cycle shop vendors near hostels have further affected his business.",
      "In June, cycle shop vendors attempted to renew their passes as they usually do. However, this time the Estate Office refused to process the renewals for all vendors. When the vendors inquired about the issue, they were informed that the Security Office would now handle the pass renewals. However, when they approached the Security Office, they were redirected back to the Estate Office, leaving them caught in a loop. By mid-June, security guards at the gates warned the vendors to renew their passes or vacate the space, as they would be denied entry to the campus after July 1st. However,the eviction process was halted following the intervention of some Hall Presidents, who met with the Estate Office to address the issue..",
      "However, later a letter was sent to wardens of various hostels, whichstatedthat the cycle shops in front of the hostels encroach on institute land. Wardens were requested to allocate space for cycle shops within the hostels, if needed, through a tendering process. The deadline for this process was set for August 31, 2024.",
      "When asked about the possible impacts of removal of these shops on the cycle shop vendors and their services, they highlighted the following concerns:",
      "Vox spoke with Mr. Dhruv Misra, President of Students’ Gymkhana, to understand the reasons behind this alteration. He highlighted that the primary concern is security. The Security Office had received complaints about security risks, including unknown individuals entering the campus and gathering at these shops. He pointed out that if any unfortunate incidents occur due to these shops, it would be unclear who should be held accountable since they are not part of the official tender process.",
      "He also mentioned that the cycle pumps (compressors) are provided and funded by the hostels themselves. Additionally, he stated that all vendors plying on campus have to undergo a formal registration for legal and safety purposes. In return, the institute would provide them with facilities, such as secured space for their equipment.",
      "Vox reached out to the Estate Office and the Dean of Administration for their opinion on this matter. However, they refused to comment, stating that the issue is still under process.",
      "When asked about the impact of these measures on the campus community, Dhruv acknowledged that it would affect them. He claimed that the goal is not to take away facilities from them but to provide them in a proper and designated manner.",
      "Regarding the next steps, he stated that to expedite the process, the management will soon organize a meeting with all hall wardens. This meeting will aim to resolve disputes and provide the vendors with a designated place at a minimal cost.",
      "As of August 30th, the meeting with wardens has not been organised yet.",
      "Amidst these developments, when we reached out to the cycle shop vendors again, they told us that no shops had been allocated to them inside the halls, as of August 30th, 2024. Additionally, they have been instructed to vacate their current spaces by August 31st, 2024.",

      "The field ofSpace Science and Astronomyhas progressed significantly in recent years. India, along with many other countries, is actively exploring space and has ambitious plans for future missions aimed at achieving scientific and technological advancements.",
      "Despite this progress, a few years ago, India, and IIT Kanpur in particular, faced a gap in educational offerings in the field of astronomy and space engineering. According toProf. Pankaj Jain, Head of theDepartment of Space, Planetary & Astronomical Sciences & Engineering (SPASE), IITK, “In India, while many research institutes contribute significantly to the field of astronomy, such as ARIES in Nainital, the National Center for Radio Astrophysics in Pune, and the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, these institutions primarily focus on research rather than education. Though some offer PhD programs, they generally do not provide undergraduate or Master’s degrees. Historically, academic involvement in astronomy in India has been limited, but this trend is now changing and expanding.”",
      "The concept for the department was introduced quite a while ago, around 2018. However, it got delayed due to COVID and other factors. And then there were several reviews before it actually took shape.",
      "The department followed a structured process to establish itself. Initially, a proposal was formulated by either an individual or a group of members. This proposal then underwent an initial review within the institution, involving feedback from various departments. Following this, the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) conducted a critical review of the proposal. After the EPC’s evaluation, the proposal was returned to the departments for additional feedback. It was then reviewed by a National Advisory Committee, consisting of prominent experts in the relevant field, before proceeding to the Academic Senate. Once the Academic Senate approved the proposal, it was finally submitted to the Board of Directors for the final decision.",
      "After completing this rigorous process, the SPASE department was officially established on January 12, 2022, under the leadership of then-Director Prof. Abhay Karandikar of IIT Kanpur.",
      "Establishing the SPASE department at IIT Kanpur presented several significant challenges. One of theforemost issues was determining the viability of job opportunities for graduates.With ISRO being the main employer for space roles in India, there were concerns about sufficient job opportunities to justify the department. Assessing the job market was crucial to ensure meaningful employment for graduates.",
      "Funding posed another significant hurdle. The department required substantial financial resources to support research, especially for hardware and experimental work. Initial funding of3 croresfrom IIT Kanpur was allocated, but it has already been utilized. To establish a solid foundation, the department estimates that around10 croreswill be necessary, with a long-term goal of50 croresto support the recruitment of additional faculty and ongoing initiatives. Securing this level of funding has been an ongoing challenge, though the department has obtained some support from the Space Technology Cell and IIT Kanpur.",
      "Another challenge was building awareness about the new department. Initial efforts to promote the department faced obstacles, with many on campus unaware of its focus. To address this, the department is actively working to increase its visibility and attract students through outreach programs.",
      "Space considerations present another substantial challenge. The department requireslarge lab spacesto accommodate the extensive hardware. Efforts are underway to acquire aspace-qualified detectorfrom the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which will be used to teach students about space-qualified instruments and their operational standards. The department is also exploring the potential of launching this instrument once it is fully operational.",
      "The complexity of working with hardware, as opposed to software, is evident. Space science involves large-scale projects such as rockets, observatories, and telescopes, all of which demand significant space and resources. The integration of hardware into the curriculum and the development of physical infrastructure underscores the department’s commitment to advancing space science education and research despite these considerable challenges.",
      "The SPASE department is currently staffed byseven full-time faculty members, complemented by Dr. Prashant Sharma, a joint faculty member, and two visiting faculty members. Additionally, Dr. Deepak Dhingra from the Earth Sciences Department has been closely associated with SPASE.",
      "The SPASE department features cutting-edge facilities to advance its research and educational goals. The Space Instrumentation Lab is equipped with charged particle, gamma-ray, and X-ray detectors, essential for monitoring space environments and serving as a student training ground. The Optical and Infrared Astronomy Lab offers optical instruments and a telescope, focusing on adaptive optics to enhance observational accuracy.",
      "The Radio Astronomy Lab is setting up experiments and a large antenna for the SWAN network, a national project aimed at creating a large-scale telescope.The SWAN project proposes anationwide radio astronomy networkwith 1000 sq. m arrays at multiple locations, including one currently atIIT Kanpur’s SPASE department.Operating at50-500 MHz, the network will study fast and slow radio transients and high-resolution imaging. This initiative will involve over40institutes across India and train hundreds of students in advanced radio astronomy research.For more information, lookhere.",
      "The Planetary Science Lab models planetary phenomena and includes a Planetary Geology Lab for studying planetary rock samples. Additionally, the Data Analysis Lab provides advanced computer systems for analyzing astronomical data. Collaboration with the Civil Engineering Department Lab, located near the airstrip, supports geodesic studies and space-based observations.",
      "Regarding student enrollment, the department currently has12 Ph.D. students. The M.Tech program began with modest enrollment: one student in the first year who left for a job, and two students in the second year, who also departed for similar reasons. The department is working to attract more students through the GATE exam and is optimistic about increasing enrollment in the future.",
      "The SPASE department at IIT Kanpur envisions growth and innovation over the next two to three years. The primary goals include expanding the faculty to attract experts in rocket control, satellite operations, and space technology, with plans to collaborate closely with ISRO. A key initiative is to establish a center for payload development to train students in designing and building space-qualified payloads.The department also aims to delve into exciting areas like space settlements, exploring challenges related to extraterrestrial habitats. Ensuring that courses remain aligned with global advancements is a priority, addressing the need for updated and relevant education.Additionally, fostering industry partnerships is crucial. The department seeks to collaborate with industries and startups on joint projects.",
      "Prof. Pankaj Jain emphasized, “We are committed to leading in space exploration research and inspiring students to tackle the engineering challenges of venturing beyond Earth. IIT Kanpur’s strong intellectual foundation positions us perfectly to drive these pioneering efforts and prepare for humanity’s future in space.”",
      "The response to the Space Department’s research initiatives at IIT Kanpur has been promising. The department has observed significant initial interest in its courses, particularly those focused on astronomy and planetary science. Upcoming additions, such as a course on space technology and an undergraduate course offering a broad overview of the field, are expected to further boost interest.",
      "Despite being in its early stages, the department has already achieved notable research milestones. For example, a recent collaboration with theCosmic Ray Observatoryled to the discovery of a subtle deviation in the cosmic ray spectrum around160 TeV.This intriguing finding is set to be featured in an upcoming publication. Additionally, research utilizing data fromASTROSAT, India’s pioneering space-based science observatory, has provided new insights into neutron stars and their flux variations, contributing to the understanding of their equation of state.",
      "Dr. Ishan Sharma’s work onasteroid formationhas also yielded valuable findings, enhancing our understanding of how asteroids take shape.",
      "Notably, Dr. Prashant Pathakdiscovered a new giant planet,Epsilon Indi Ab, orbiting a Sun-like star. His research has been published inNature.  Read the research paperhere.",
      "As we explore new frontiers in space science, the SPASE department at IIT Kanpur is leading groundbreaking research and innovation. Their commitment to advancing space exploration and nurturing future scientists highlights India’s growing role in cosmic discovery.",
      "Vox wishes SPASE continued success and a Happy National Space Day to all.",

Kar Medical College, Kolkata. The march served as a collective call for justice and a demand for the protection and safety of women across India.",
      "The event was organized by Ms. Ritama K., a Ph.D. student at IIT Kanpur, along with her friends, as a demonstration of grief and solidarity with the victim. The march took place on the night of August 14th, symbolizing “women reclaiming the night” as Independence Day approached.",
      "Participants gathered at OAT and followed a route that included the Swimming Pool, Hall 2, Gate 3, Kargil Chowk, KV, and the Health Centre before returning to OAT. The march was well received as more than 1000 participants joined in. It was led by women and concluded with the national anthem back at the OAT.The mail circulated to the campus community regarding call for protest read, “We march not only to seek justice for the heinous crime that took place in R.G. Kar Hospital, Kolkata, but to demand protection and safety for every woman in every workplace across India.”",

      "In the 48th and final edition of As We Leave 2024, we turn the spotlight on the journey of an unlikely candidate—one that’s defined by the thrill of the ride and the miles covered. This time, it’s not a person but a cycle, that has lived through countless stories and endless campus explorations. From late-night sprints to quiet rides along empty roads, this humble companion reflects on its time at IITK with a sense of fulfilment.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As I barely hold myself upright with the help of my stand, reminiscing the past four years on this campus, I realize it’s been a hell of a ‘ride’. From scorching heat to spine-chilling nights, I’ve seen it all. From traversing the unexplored campus corners to staring into the nothingness of the academic area, I’ve done it all. So have a seat, tighten your helmets, and pedal through my journey, where I become something more than just a metallic frame.",
      "I remember my first day on campus, standing with my friends on a basketball court in front of what seemed to be a humongous red building, showcased for those glittery-eyed freshers to choose us. Anyways, it wasn’t long before I was chosen by one such freshman, full of hope and naivety, eager to spend the next four years together. If only I hadn’t been wearing my rose-colored glasses back then.",
      "The initial days were nothing short of a honeymoon phase. Early morning rides to class, leisurely spins around the kargil chowk, and occasional weekend excursions. It was bliss, and I reveled in the newfound freedom, my tires gliding smoothly over every path. I got to relax in the parking shed after every tiring day, assured of my safety as my tires were locked to the rods on the wall. My new friends and I, all happy and shiny, shared tales of our exciting rides and laughed at the minor bumps along the way. Gossiping about someone’s flat tires and showing off our latest six digit tattoos was a regular routine. But as they say, good things don’t last long.",
      "The initial enthu of protecting me was gone. And before I knew it, the parking shed was replaced by the open sky. There were also times when I felt utterly alone. One day, amidst the chaos of endsems, I got lost. My already panicked fresher had hurriedly parked me outside the library, forgetting to lock me in the rush to cram for an upcoming test. I knew my safety was compromised. To add insult to injury, I was even pushed to the ground. There I was, lying in the dirt, waiting for him.",
      "The sun dawned, and I was still there, my frame aching from the rough treatment. As hours passed, I started feeling sleepy, abandoned, and resigned to my fate. Just when I thought I’d be left to rust, someone finally picked me up. But as I was regaining my poise, realization hit me—it wasn’t my naive fresher!",
      "I was reluctantly taken to an unfamiliar location. The majority of my new companions were old, worn out cycles. They were lifeless, probably because of the cruel acts of weather and road. I longed for the carefree days of my past. Now, I was accessorized with a torn lock, a sad testament to my condition. My once vibrant coat had lost its luster in a matter of days.",
      "But knowing that this is what I was now, I started getting accustomed to this new normal. My new owner was no fresh-faced novice but a weary soul, worn down by the grind of existence. He lacked the zest to ride with purpose. The daily trudge from the gate to the classroom was so dreary that I found myself feeling sorry for him rather than for my own state.",
      "Days passed, and the hope of ever returning to my previous owner faded away. My frame was slowly being eaten by rust. I had accepted this new lifestyle. Months, maybe even years, went by. One day, I found myself on a new road. I thought my owner had finally found some zeal for adventure. Little did I know, this road was a one-way ticket to a second-hand cycle sale.",
      "As I sat among other forgotten pieces, potential buyers wandered by, scrutinizing us with varying degrees of interest. Finally, a fresher approached. The gleam in his eye and the excitement in his step, I knew it all too well. He bought me, and for a moment, I thought I might feel that old thrill. But the newness was gone, and I couldn’t muster the same outlook for life.",
      "Gone were the days of eager anticipation and joyrides. Now, every pedal felt like a reminder of my faded glory. The fresher, brimming with enthusiasm, tried to breathe new life into me. But all his efforts turned futile. The damaged roads on the way to the academic area, flanked by trees on both sides, occasionally flooding in the rainy season, all these did give me deja vu, but not enough to give me the love for life that I once had.",
      "We, as cycles, are meant to serve some purpose, a purpose I had failed miserably at. The ‘chain’ of events had me freewheeling through life, and inevitably, my owner got fed up with me. I was abandoned near the Hall 12 gate, left to withstand the harsh weather until a guard took me and parked me near one of those cycle shops. The place where I once stopped for checkups had now become my home.",
      "So here I am, a rusting relic, a monument to faded glory and forgotten rides. It’s ironic, really. I once dreamed of endless roads and thrilling adventures, and now I’m just a pile of scrap, a cautionary tale for shiny new bikes with dreams of their own.",
      "But hey, if there’s a lesson in all this, it’s that life keeps pedaling forward, whether you’re shiny and new or a bit rusty around the edges. Though my frame is weathered and my paint chipped, the memories of my journey remain vivid. For every cycle out there, take heed: cherish every pedal, every bump, and every scrape, because the journey, no matter how bumpy, is what defines us. Keep your spokes crossed and gears in motion. Each dent and scratch tells a story of resilience and adventure, of moments spent racing the wind or carrying dreams under the starry sky.",
      "As We Leave, I realize that it’s not about the shiny exterior but the enduring spirit within. Embrace the challenges, celebrate your small victories. And let’s be honest—without us, these nerdy brains would’ve had a tough time hoofing it to the gate for those metro rides to Z square!",

      "In this 44th edition of As We Leave 2024, Harsh Sharma, a Y20 student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, takes us through his memories at IIT Kanpur. He talks about the ups and downs he faced, and all the fun he had nevertheless.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Yesterday, I saw the reel posted by Vox stating that the “As We Leave” series for the graduating batch starts releasing the next day, and I suddenly realized that it is time that I finally start writing my own. After all, my whole college life had been all about doing stuff close to the deadlines (this time though I crossed the deadline, not the first time doing so).",
      "I have read many AWLs—some very emotional and inspiring, and others dull—and I always wondered what my AWL would look like. Like everyone else, I too believe that I have a lot of stories to share and am different from others, but deep inside I know that nothing in IIT Kanpur is unique to an individual. You always share experiences, and that is what made my hard days in college bearable- thinking that someone else would have been in the same position as me or maybe in a graver situation, and yet they survived.",
      "I am not trying to inspire you, nor do I believe I am perfect or even a good person for that. I am someone whose trajectory you should never follow, but as I just mentioned, someone would be living the experiences I did and feeling the same things I did. My AWL is just a recollection of my life at IITK. Instead of just sharing my story in a chronological manner, I tried to express my emotions—not too much, for I believe that even though someone can go through the same situation as me, we can’t ever share the same emotions. That is what I call emotional prints, different for everyone, and your emotional print defines the person you’ll become after every situation. If you had a rough night sobbing and crying, remember I had been in your place too; maybe I cried a little louder or you sobbed a little too much, but we all do make it to the end, for the end is as beautiful as the people we had in life. Don’t give up; it is all part of a bigger plan, and your role is just to keep on moving. Moreover, if you still want to derive some motivation or moral values out of this AWL, just follow the lines I did: Never give up, and whatever happens, happens for the best.",
      "My wingies with whom I had the best time on Campus, from L to R: Me, Saif, Prem, Mehul, Rishabh, and Navnee",
      "As I cleared JEE and saw my 3rd-standard dream of being an IITian turn real, I was elated and assumed the stereotypical lines of Bollywood movies “College me kaun padhta hai?” were true, and I have lived the stereotype to the fullest. Since the beginning of my Zoom days, I was always the try-hard kid—not the one who always tries to fit into different circles but the one who always wanted to try his hands at everything. Being someone who is not at all introverted, I quickly made friends in my department and with my wingmates, some of whom remained with me till the end of my time here.",
      "The first semester went bizarrely fast with me trying to cope with courses like MTH101 and PHY102, but I eventually ended up getting a B in both and a D in TA101. After all, I am bad at drawing, and that is the best excuse (evidently not) for folks like me. I also got into the first relationship of my life during the first semester, and fortunately, it is still intact, even though maintaining a long-distance relationship for more than three years was pretty tough. By the end of the semester, I had made more friends by participating in various competitions organized by different cells and councils, and I knew that joining more of them would help me make my circle bigger, even though this was never actually a plan.",
      "The second semester was dull and monotonous as the second wave of COVID hit the country, and the nth wave of procrastination hit me. I got addicted to helpful WhatsApp groups for passing the exams and eventually ended up dropping PHY103, afraid of the consequences after being caught cheating. This was the first blow to my studious life. From being admired for my dedication and hard work to dropping a course after being caught cheating, I quickly realized that college life was not going to be easy, and if I wanted to make the most of it, I had to be more cautious about everything I did here. I quickly resurfaced from it and started focusing on different clubs and activities. I joined Ecell, Udghosh, and Techkriti and tried to take gyan from seniors. I also got a summer project from the Astronomy Club, but the codes never fascinated me, and I eventually dropped out of it, realizing that this was not something that could hold me for life.",
      "The first year ended, and I was still anticipating the campus reopening. At the same time, the secy recruitment for SnT clubs began, and I was keenly eyeing only one entity—IITK Consulting Group—since it seemed like the best place for a person trying to break into consulting. This was a decision I made very early in my college life. I would advise any junior to completely exploit all the opportunities on campus before finalizing a career goal, unlike me, and even better if you don’t stick to one but keep on exploring more, as it drives you to keep on learning forever. I got recruited and was glad. At the same time, I got involved in more places—joining Antaragni, Community Welfare Cell, and becoming a Student Guide and Academic Mentor by the end of the third semester. The campus reopened for resource-constrained students, and many of my friends went back. Since I didn’t get the chance to go to campus, I planned a trip with my college friends, during which I nearly escaped death after slipping from a hilly trail. I still owe my friend Rishabh a life for saving me.",
      "Finally, as the third semester ended, I cleared all my courses again, although I was expecting an E or F in ESO209. When the news of the campus reopening finally came, I started preparing for the new life I had always anticipated. I arrived on campus on December 29, 2022, and I felt proud of my hard work for making it there because the vibe was entirely different. The fourth semester began with a lot of fun. For the first time, I saw the places I had only heard about from seniors, met those seniors who shared their stories, and experienced everything with people as excited and eager as I was. The campus felt like home to me from the very first day.",
      "Amidst all the fun and explorations, I met a whole bunch of new people, and my circle grew. Among all the fun, I also had to ensure that I studied well for the fourth semester, as I had to pass some of the most difficult courses like ESO202 and ESO201. However, those who knew me would tell you that I never cared about studies as much as I should have, so you should not follow my example. As I said, IITK is full of people doing the same forbidden things.",
      "During the E-Summit, I had the opportunity to network with many startups and their founders. One such founder, Mr. Sumeet Mahendra of RTIwala, played a critical role in my life. I connected with him regarding an E-Summit competition, and eventually, the conversation turned to him seeking web development interns from IITK. Although I was never into technology despite being an engineering undergrad, I didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity and asked him to schedule a meeting where we could discuss such prospects.",
      "I saw this as an opportunity to secure a project for ICG, as RTIwala appeared to be a promising startup with government accolades. In the meantime, I prepared a presentation to convince Sumeet to give a project to ICG. What happened during the supposedly 20-minute meeting, which lasted two hours, is an altogether different story, but apparently, I convinced him.",
      "The end of February also marked a significant moment in my life as I got the chance to work on an Inter IIT Tech Meet problem statement. The one-month journey changed my whole perspective on college life as for the very first time I realized that working on such challenging problems is what makes you an IITian for real and I would emphasize it in bold to anyone reading to try to participate in atleast one Inter IIT competition be it tech,sports or cult for it can teach way more than anything else on campus. Working on the problem statement, although very tiring and exhausting at times, was altogether fun. Thanks to all my teammates who bore me with my poorest jokes and all the seniors, who were ready to help me with even my dumbest doubts. Our hard work paid and we won the Gold Medal. This achievement gave me a sense of satisfaction as I remembered the lines I read somewhere “Agar IIT se graduate hote hue tumhari sabse badi achievement IITian hona hi hai toh tumne yahan aa kar kuch nahi kiya!”. With Inter IIT over, I again switched my focus towards RTIwala and started working as an intern with them. All three fests and their Pronites around the time came as a wave of celebration as I witnessed our college’s fests live for the first time.",

      "The end of February marked a significant moment in my life as I got the chance to work on an Inter IIT Tech Meet problem statement. The one-month journey changed my whole perspective on college life because, for the very first time, I realized that working on such challenging problems is what makes you an IITian for real. I would emphasize to anyone reading this to try to participate in at least one Inter IIT competition, be it tech, sports, or cultural, for it can teach you way more than anything else on campus.",
      "Working on the problem statement, although tiring and exhausting at times, was altogether fun. Thanks to all my teammates who bore my poorest jokes and all the seniors who were ready to help me with even my dumbest doubts. Our hard work paid off, and we won the Gold Medal. This achievement gave me a sense of satisfaction as I remembered the lines I read somewhere, “Agar IIT se graduate hote hue tumhari sabse badi achievement IITian hona hi hai toh tumne yahan aa kar kuch nahi kiya!” With Inter IIT over, I again switched my focus to RTIwala and started working as an intern with them.",
      "All three fests and their Pronites around that time came as a wave of celebration as I witnessed our college’s fests live for the first time.",
      "I was very confident about securing the leader position as I had put my best foot forward to prepare for the role, talking to seniors and my fellow secretaries to gather more insight into the workings. I was also putting in my best efforts to work with RTIwala to gain credibility from their end as well. At the same time, I offered two summer projects on behalf of ICG, one in collaboration with others and the second one alone. To handle all these things and to prepare well for the intern season, I decided not to retake PHY103, which I had dropped earlier, as I was aware I would not be able to put much effort into studying it, and my grade would be low—something I didn’t want for the intern and placement season.",
      "Having done all my preparation, I appeared for the interview, and when the results came, I was lost. I was not made the leader. I couldn’t understand why it happened, as my intentions and efforts were all for the best. I introspected into my 20-year-long life until then and realized that whenever I worked hard for anything, I never lost. So, why now? I wanted to be the leader not just to hold the PoR but because I wanted to harness the full potential ICG had. I thought it could give me a portal to work with amazing startups, startups that had fascinated me since the time of TVF, making me realize that “Mein beer hu.” I firmly believe that as a leader I would have done my best for ICG, but I also totally respect the panel’s decision not to make me the leader, as I believe they would have thought, just like me, the best for their group.  At the same time, I also think that if I had been made the leader, maybe I would have taken it as yet another easy win and would not have done the things I did because I was not made the leader. Today, I am thankful that it happened the way it was meant to, for God’s plan is better than ours.",
      "To revive myself from the blow, I went home, channeled my energy, and came back to campus. I am really thankful that my home was just an overnight journey away, so whenever I felt low, I went back home and talked with my family members—not about the problems in my life. I don’t remember if I ever shared any problem in my life with any of my family. I wanted to learn to fight things alone and always viewed these problems as insignificant to be shared, no matter how big they seemed at the time. Eventually, I realized this practice helped me learn that no problem in the world is bigger than you perceive it to be. I just talked with them and thought about how I have people in my life for whom I have to do something. Settling down easily isn’t an option as long as I can keep going.",
      "At the same time, the nominations for the manager of the Outreach Cell were out, and it was the last third PoR remaining to be filled at the time, as far as I remember. So, I applied for it as I was eager to gain a shortlist with Bain and BCG, which were supposed to be coming for the intern season for the first time. I’ll keep this part short: I applied for the PoR, got it, and didn’t make it to the shortlists of either company, thanks to my low CPI and my foolishness in forgetting to mention my Tech Meet Gold Medal on the resume I submitted to Bain. Not getting shortlisted was a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as I was not really expecting the shortlists.",
      "Phase 1 of the intern season was not very happening for me, as I only got one shortlist, and that too for a machine learning role, thanks to the online assessment. How I wish the interview was also with the video turned off. By the end of Phase 1, I was without any internship from the campus.",
      "But on and off campus, I was trying my hands at different things yet again. A new society was in the making—Product Management Interest Group—and one of the Y19 founders, Kritarth, knew me well from the Inter IIT time and asked if I wanted to join. Being an opportunist and eager to work for such a society, I said yes at once. I started helping them organize boot camps and workshops while also gathering insight about product management as a field, which looked like yet another domain where I could try my hands.",
      "At the same time, I saw a post on LinkedIn from a Y18, who I only knew by name, hiring marketing interns for his startup, and it was unpaid. I scrolled past the post. As the first two months of Phase 1 had already passed without me having any internship, I spent time on Workday and LinkedIn searching for opportunities. One day, I saw the same job opening for the unpaid marketing intern again. My gut feeling told me to download the app “Nevermind.” My inner voice said it truly holds what I want to do, an odd but intriguing name. I explored it briefly, closed it, and opened Instagram to procrastinate, but Nevermind opened instead with a question. Then I understood their USP—every time you open an unproductive app, you first have to solve a habit-building question. It was this eureka moment that led me to text the recruiter, Sriram, on LinkedIn, telling him I wanted this intern position. We got on yet another supposedly 10-minute call, which turned into an hour, with him telling me everything about his startup and saying, “Yes, we need someone to handle our business aspects, but for that, you need to prove credibility.” I started working hard to make the best use of this opportunity, from devising and executing strategies to gain downloads to leading pitches with VCs.",
      "Apparently, in a few days, the founders agreed to settle me as their co-founder and to let me lead the business and growth verticals. At this crucial step, I again pitched to Sumeet to help us as a mentor in our startup. His advice helped us a lot, and we reached out to multiple VCs across India, trying to gain some funding. While most of them liked our idea, and we managed to win Upstart’23 and also secured a pitching round in an international trade conference, we were not able to secure any funds. Still, we thought of implementing some strategies.",
      "By the end of 2022, I had no internship but only Nevermind in hand, and our core team decided that either we secure some investments by the end of March or Nevermind should end. I forgot to mention earlier, but in the fifth semester, I was also seeking projects with foreign professors to gain international experience. Although I got two such projects, one with a professor from Wharton, I decided not to continue with either as they were related to a domain I was least interested in—Web Development. It was tough for me to turn down such an opportunity, but I was firm about not doing something that didn’t fit my interest. It isn’t a decision I am really proud of, as I gave up something without really trying it, but deep down my heart told me, even if you try and make something out of it, would the journey be enjoyable? This was a question I always carried with me: if it isn’t about the destination but the journey, make sure it is happening and enjoyable. No worries if it is chaotic, but make sure you surf on the highest tides if there are any. But I know this is not for everyone reading. You might not be fortunate enough to neglect your responsibilities and just keep on following your passion. If you are not, just try to make what you do as enjoyable as possible; otherwise, the going gets tough.",
      "It might look like most of the things I did were to build a solid resume, and I won’t shy away from saying that indeed a few things I did were to give a boost to my CV—after all, no pursuit is without a cause. But some of the things I did were purely out of interest and passion—Nevermind and Inter IIT Tech Meets being two such things. Apparently, I got yet another chance to do what I love the most: work on another Tech Meet problem statement. This problem statement, although barely a week long, was more hectic than the last one, as I had to work more than 14-15 hours daily straight for nine days. Thanks to amazing seniors and the sweetest juniors who were ready to sit and work for as long as I did. Yet again, we won the Gold Medal, and I felt a sense of relief amidst the chaos in my mind, as Nevermind was still bootstrapped and the scholarship amount we secured from SIIC was on the verge of being completely burned.",
      "Another Tech Meet, another Gold Team",
      "In the middle of February, I received a very unexpected phone call from Sumeet Mahendra. He told me they were about to raise a round from a UK-based VC and wanted me to join them after graduation on a full-time basis in a leadership position. The proposed salary was good, the ESOPs were more than good, and the equity I was offered was beyond my imagination. I had two days to respond to the offer, as they had to submit my name to the VC for due diligence. I talked with as many people as I could about this offer, and while most said I should go for it, I turned it down.",
      "I thought, if a startup’s CEO, who has known me for barely a few months and has never met me in real life, has this much conviction in a third-year student, why should I settle for less? I knew there was a high possibility that Nevermind would not gain the expected funding and might shut down, and also the possibility that the placement I might get would not be as lucrative as the offer in hand. But I still decided not to go for it, as my gut feeling said my destiny was not there. Reflecting on my life, I see many decisions I made were based on my gut feelings, and somehow the trajectory I achieved through them turned out fine. I really believe decisions made from the heart and intuition are more inclined toward your best interest, as your inner voice would never let you choose something that could cause you unhappiness. Always listen to yourself before others, for you know yourself the best, and others know only a version of you. The 8 billion people in the world live different notions of life every day, and it is your notion and perspective of yourself that should matter most to you.",
      "By the end of March, Nevermind was history as we couldn’t secure any investments. It was another heart-wrenching event in my life, but I was prepared for it and thanked God for the learning experience. It was at this time that I started becoming serious about internships and summers. Around the corner, PMIG was also formalized as a group, and I saw yet another dream of establishing something for the campus community come true. I put in genuine efforts to do as much as I could for the group and the campus junta through it, and I am grateful to my co-leaders Ayush and Bhavya for having the same mindset as me. I wish to see the society grow in the coming years and students benefiting from it.",
      "Around the same time, I applied for the position of Overall Coordinator of Outreach Cell, but as destiny had it, I was not made the OC. This time, I was not sad about not getting the position, as Gitika and Utkarsh, who became the OCs, did complete justice to the position, and all of us managers from Outreach Cell are still the best of friends.",
      "Before the end of the th semester, two crucial events took place. GC happened, and I became the pool captain for Takneek, a pun to my identity of having no interest in tech. But this was something I genuinely wanted to do for Hall-3, not for the sake of improving my resume, as I already had many things on it. I can’t contain myself from saying that the entire GC was full of biases, especially against our pool (Aryans), and anyone who witnessed it couldn’t counter that. Long story short, I was impeached from my pool captain position mid-Takneek, as was the Aryans’ Galaxy pool captain. But by then, the Hall feeling had gone beyond any position or name. Everyone, especially our group “GC wale Launde,” neglected everything to win the GC for Hall-3. Although we couldn’t win any of the GC events, thanks to the organizing teams and their bias towards their favorite halls, the friends I made during GC are still very close to me. All the seniors, batchmates, and juniors developed a mutual feeling of respect for each other, and I am pretty sure that anyone who participated on behalf of Aryans in that GC can never forget the efforts we put into winning the cups.",
      "GC wale Launde",
      "During the end semesters for the 6th semester, I had no intern in hand, and my startup didn’t exist anymore. Suddenly, Accenture visited the campus to hire interns for a role where coding was not a prerequisite. I thought this might be my chance but wasn’t too hopeful, as I had had the same thought more than ten times before. But it happened—I was shortlisted after the test, thanks to my friends, and my interview went decently well. Summer break was meant to begin on May 4, and on May 3, around 8:30 PM, my roommate Mehul told me that someone he knew got into Accenture and asked me to check if I managed it. Although I was pretty sure I would face defeat yet again, the moment I opened the mail to find SPO’s congratulation mail, I told Mehul, and we both shouted at the top of our voices. Fast forward a few weeks or months, I went to Mumbai for my internship, explored the city, met new people, and worked. I knew I was not going to get a PPO, as the company had already announced it in the first meeting itself, yet I worked in the hope of getting one. As announced, no one got a PPO, but I still managed a LoR from my manager and some praises from the senior leadership of the company for my work.",
      "By the end of summer, back on campus, I started preparing for product roles, as my resume was more inclined toward it, and consulting looked like a far reach since my CPI was not in the safe bracket. With the semester starting, I was enjoying the peace of a single room and the vibe of Hall-1. One day, while sitting in the canteen, a friend I made during GC in Hall-3, Avi, who was now Udghosh’s festival coordinator, approached me and asked if I wanted to be the Head of Media and Publicity of Udghosh. I declined, saying I wanted to focus on my placements and, as I had no idea about the vertical at all, I might screw up. But he convinced me to think about it for a few days. I was sure to turn down the offer as I didn’t want to shift to B-bot, leaving all my wingies behind, and I wanted some peace during placement sem. Still, one day I contacted Anand Patwa, who was the MnP Head of Antaragni and worked with me during the Inter IIT Tech Meet, to ask what I should do, and he said to go for it. I blindly followed his advice.",
      "I can assure you that joining Udghosh was an amazing decision in my life as it taught me the real meaning of management. The Core Team was wonderful, and being a novice to the vertical, I got much-needed support from them. The two months went by bizarrely fast, and the fest concluded well. Now, it was time to switch gears again as companies had started approaching for placements. The companies I was targeting the most were Flipkart and Groww. I worked hard on Flipkart’s PS, but as destiny had it, I didn’t make the shortlist. So while working on Groww’s PS, I was very reluctant and hopeless, completing the submission within 10 hours or so, not expecting a shortlist. But this time I did manage a shortlist. Fast forwarding to November 30, I had a single shortlist in 1.1, four shortlists in 1.2, and no other shortlists after that. I was pretty sure I’d manage an offer in 1.2, as two of the shortlists were for product roles, and I knew I had prepared well.",
      "I would also like to share a fact here that my sister, my very own sibling, was meant to be married on December 4, thanks to my father who didn’t ask me before finalizing the date. So, I slept through 1.1 as the company I was shortlisted for didn’t call me for an interview. 1.2 began with Groww’s interview, which went fantastic, and in the meantime, I appeared for the Tata1mg interview, which also went quite well. The second round for both companies was at the same time, and a senior from Tata1mg said it was my call where I wanted to go. At that moment, I chose to go for the Groww interview. The second round was better than the first one, but apparently, Groww had rejected all the interviewees after the second round, including me. I rushed to Tata1mg for a chance but couldn’t manage one as I had “made the choice” to go for Groww. Meanwhile, I missed the GD for Palo Alto Networks as I knew I had no scope there, and Groww and Tata1mg interviews were more promising. Then I went for the Indus Insights interview, but by the time my second round began, people were already getting offers, and I knew right from the beginning of the second round that they were doing it just for formality. Day 1.2 was over, and I had no job in hand. Day 2.1 was about to begin in a few hours, and I had no shortlist and had to reach home for the wedding. I didn’t pick up calls from anyone at home and avoided any messages. I prepared myself for Day 2.1 and sat there for 4-5 hours straight without any walk-ins. 2.2 was no different, except I mistakenly picked up a call from my father, and all he told me was not to worry and do what I felt like. I got back to my room after 2.2 and broke down in my room after midnight on the call with my girlfriend as I had no shortlists the next day either.",
      "Amid all this chaos, the only thing constant with me was my friends—Mehul, Rishabh, Avi, and Daksh—who all had a bunch of copies of my resume for walk-ins. I woke up on the 3rd morning to find I had a shortlist from Niva Bupa, and the interview began in an hour. Although hopeless, I still gathered the courage, prepared the introduction, and went for the interview. Mine was the first interview. I entered the room, and it went well for about 45 minutes. I came out expecting to hear updates about the following rounds, but there were none. The company took as many as 100 interviews, and it was already 8 PM without any result. I was frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. I went back to my room and couldn’t think of what to do. My sister’s wedding was the next day, and I had no clue if I should go home or stay. I broke down again—for the first time in my life, I broke down that way. Then suddenly, I got a call from my friend that the company’s HR wanted to meet me. I raced at my highest speed and reached Hall 12, and I managed an offer. It was the most relieving and comforting moment of my life, for I knew now I could go and fulfill my responsibilities.",
      "I left for home at the earliest and attended the function. On December 5, when I woke up after a tiring previous day, I got the most unexpected result of my graduation life—I got a backlog in a DC, in a course I never thought of. I tried reaching out to the course instructor, but he ended the call after hearing my name. I was tense again for the whole of December, trying to find a solution to the problem of degree extension and ranting about no compartment exams, etc., to my fellow friends who also failed. By the way, around 25% of the department failed the course. As I couldn’t find a way out of it, I thought of letting it be, for it was meant to be. Out of all the semesters I spent at IITK, the 7th one was the only one where I wasn’t expecting a backlog, and I managed it eventually, so life always has ways to bring you the unexpected.",
      "I spent my last semester doing everything I could before my college life ended, went on trips with friends, went on a solo trip, tried different “stuff,” and many more things. The semester ended with me passing all the courses, including PHY113, a substitute for PHY103. Yes, I did it with Y23s, so what? :’) Slowly, everyone started departing, and the realization that the faces of some of the best people would never be seen again hit me. So that’s how college life ended—not for me exactly, as I am still doing the modular DC in which I got an F.",
      "Rightly phrased: It’s never Goodbye!",
      "If this article is published before June 15, 2024, you might find me on campus, and I allow you to question me, “Bina campus se gaye As We Leave likh diya?” So, yes, for me, the leaving date is a bit later than others, but sooner or later, everyone has to leave.",
      "At the end, I sincerely want to thank all the friends I made here for coming into my life at the right time, fitting in just like the pieces of a jigsaw. I have been privileged to have the company of the best people in my life, and the only question I have in my heart as I’ll be leaving this place is whether I have been as good to the people here as they have been to me. I hope that as I leave this place, I leave a mark in the hearts of at least those who mattered to me.",
      "That was my journey, a collection of stories through the semesters, where I had no control over the upcoming challenges but still managed to survive, knowing that it was a phase and it would pass, and the best was waiting for me at the end. I embraced whatever I got as the best. Still, I would seriously suggest any junior reading this not to follow in my footsteps, but I know someone as foolish and opportunistic as I am would be at the same crossroads. Down the line in a few years, another AWL with more or less similar content will be published.",

      "In this 37th edition of As We Leave, Anshika Singh, a Y20 student graduating in the Department of Material Science and Engineering, shares her inspiring journey. She reflects on the challenges she faced during online semester and how her life took a magical turn thereafter. She reminisces about her cherished college moments, friendships and her experiences at Prayas, which provided her the with the best memories of her entire college life.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "After so much contemplation, I’ve finally decided to share this. Let’s start by introducing myself. This is Anshika Singh, a girl who comes from a very small village in Uttar Pradesh where modern facilities are scarce and very few have seen higher education or significant success. Our village struggles with frequent power outages and limited internet access.",
      "Like every other student, I was very excited to join college, though my excitement was tinged with apprehension. Before joining IIT Kanpur, someone told me that my branch, “Materials Science and Engineering,” had little scope in India, which was very disheartening for me. So, I joined IIT with the goal of working very hard, getting decent CPI, and switching to a so-called better branch.",
      "Due to Covid, classes were held online. From the first lecture on the Hello IITK platform, I knew I had to work extra hard. My limited internet access made attending classes and exams very difficult. While others enjoyed Bulla sessions, family meets, and department meetings, I battled to download lectures, open quizzes, and submit assignments.",
      "To solve this issue, I discovered a spot near a pond about a kilometer away from my home, where internet access was slightly better. Every day, I walked there to download lectures then returned home to watch them. This routine was exhausting, but somehow I was managing. During exams, things used to get more difficult. Without a proper place to sit and with inconsistent internet, I often couldn’t submit my answers on time.",
      "I vividly remember the PHY103 mid-semester exam, held on the Codetantra platform. Despite having a charged laptop, my battery ran low during the exam. I ran home for a charging point, plugged it in, and continued the test, but there was no internet access at home. Still, I tried to submit my answers, but it took around 20 mins for a single answer to upload, and then the submission failed.",
      "Then came the MTH101 exam. It was my first day of contracting Covid, and my body was weak. The fever and body aches were intense, but I had an exam scheduled. Under the scorching sun, I sat in the open, struggling to focus on the questions. My internet connection was poor, and it failed despite submitting my answers 5 minutes before the submission time. I took screenshots and emailed them, but my efforts went unrecognized, and my grades suffered.",
      "The rainy season brought its own set of challenges. During one exam, it started pouring heavily. I had no shelter, and my waterproof bag could somehow protect my laptop. My exam papers were completely soaked, and I could not write anything. My phone screen became wet, and it stopped working. I couldn’t submit my answers and had to run for cover.",
      "These and many such incidents left me devastated, and my grades suffered despite my hard work. At times, I felt hopeless and considered giving up.",
      "As I faced these challenges, I knew I had to find better ways to adapt if I wanted to succeed. I started waking up earlier and staying up later to find moments when the internet connection might be more stable. I contacted professors and explained my situation, hoping for some leniency or alternative submission methods, but their hands were often tied by rules.",
      "Despite multiple adversities, I always tried to find ways to adapt. I began seeking help from family friends, and acquaintances in town who had better internet facilities. On exam days, I would travel to their homes and give exams. But this wasn’t a perfect solution, as it was awkward to impose on them, but it was necessary for my education. These adjustments, though small, started to make a difference.",
      "Initially, my biggest insecurity was my lack of proficiency in English. Because of this, I would avoid speaking with people who were fluent in English, fearing that I would embarrass myself in front of them due to my poor language skills. So, I used to talk only to those who mostly spoke Hindi. I met many good people here. It was the first time in my life that I met such broadminded people, who later became my very good friends. It is very big thanks to these supportive friends that I began confronting this insecurity. They encouraged me to start interacting with everyone, significantly boosting my confidence.",
      "Realizing that I needed to diversify my college experience beyond academics, I sought other avenues to excel. I joined several clubs and took up various roles to broaden my horizons and gain new skills. These activities allowed me to meet new people, make friends, and learn from my seniors. I became the Secretary of the Design and Animation Club and the Secretary of the Photography Club. I joined the Student Placement Office as a company coordinator and became a student guide at the Counseling Service. Involvement in these clubs helped me a lot to strengthen my leadership and interpersonal skills. It has helped me interact with many seniors and connect strongly with them. These Seniors have always guided me and helped me to navigate all the challenges.",
      "I also joined Prayas as a Volunteer. Prayas is a society that aims to help underprivileged students near the campus by providing them with free educational facilities.During Covid, Prayas classes were running Online. I vividly remember my first class with Prayas. It was a science class for third and fourth grades. It was raining that day. I stood under an umbrella at my network spot and conducted the class. The eagerness and enthusiasm of the children were contagious. The students of Prayas were a constant source of inspiration. They faced numerous challenges yet never gave up on their education. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by my struggles, I thought about these children and their unyielding determination. It gave me the strength to keep going.",
      "Although there were many challenges but, with the support of my seniors and batchmates, college life has been incredibly rewarding. Their motivation and encouragement have always helped me stay positive and made my life much more beautiful. I started enjoying things. In Fact, I started enjoying the challenges I was facing. Instead of feeling demotivated, each challenge strengthens my determination and boosts my confidence to tackle it.",
      "In October 2021, students with resource constraints were called back to campus. I was selected after submitting numerous proofs of my struggles. Seeing IIT Kanpur for the first time in person was surreal.",
      "I still remember the day I was completing the paperwork at the Community Centre. A masked person was helping me with my luggage, and I assumed he was an official assigned by the institute to assist students. Later, I met Nishant, a senior and a very good friend of mine, and discovered it was actually him helping me. That moment was incredibly awkward yet memorable, marking the beginning of a wonderful journey.",
      "After coming to campus. Life changed dramatically; I finally had access to resources and facilities I had only dreamed of. Finally, I had a good internet connection, no electricity issues with such a big and beautiful college campus, a proper study environment, and access to all the academic resources, etc.",
      "Most of my friends were not resource-constrained, so they were at home. Initially, as an introvert, making friends was very challenging for me, and I had difficulty adjusting to the new environment. However, things changed when I met Khushi. I started hanging out with her. She is such a cheerful, happy, and fun-loving person who literally brought “Khushiya” into my life. Through her only, I met her friends Navneet, Swayam, Sahil, Akshay, Pratibha, and Mohan, and we all became best friends.",
      "Campus life felt like a dream. Every morning brought new experiences and adventures. We were always together, exploring and enjoying life. Night outs, cycling around campus, discovering new places, watching movies, dancing and singing loudly in front of L20 at night, sleeping on the floors in front of lecture halls, and doing random crazy things—these fun activities defined our days. This was the first time I experienced such freedom.",
      "With all the fun activities, I also focused intensely on my academics, and my grades began to improve. The experience of being on campus, with all its facilities and opportunities, was transformative.",
      "Though I initially joined many clubs, I decided to concentrate solely on Prayas. Experiencing Prayas in its offline form was heartwarming. The dedication and selflessness of the volunteers and the joy and respect from the kids were unparalleled. Every day, as we entered Prayas, students would greet us with “Namaste Didi” with such beautiful smiles, respect, and love on their faces. This warm welcome always touched my heart, inspiring me to do more and more for them.",
      "At Prayas, I took on the role of Manager. Throughout my tenure, we ensured that classes for the students ran smoothly and without any hindrances. We organized various educational and extracurricular sessions, such as Fine Arts classes, Sexual Awareness sessions, and Skating workshops. Celebrating festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Raksha Bandhan with the kids brought immense joy and a sense of community.",
      "I vividly remember the Diwali festival when we visited the students’ homes to distribute sweets and celebrate with them. Celebrating with these kids and their parents made my day the most wonderful, filled with warmth and happiness, making me feel as if I were celebrating with my own family.",
      "Visiting the homes of Prayas students to understand their family situations and manage their admission processes was a deeply fulfilling part. It gave me a deeper understanding of their challenges and always motivated me. The respect their parents give and how they welcome us is heartwarming. Every day after class, students eagerly asked, “Didi, Aaj mere ghar chaliye ..Mai aapke liye …(some dish) banaunga/banaungi.” And they also used to fight among themselves by saying “Didi aaj mere ghar jayegi”. These moments brought me immense joy and a sense of purpose.",
      "I coordinated with various people to arrange donations for cycles, books, and stationery, which were critical to the students’ needs. These donations significantly impacted their lives, enabling them to come to Prayas regularly and study effectively.",
      "One of the most memorable experiences was organizing the Annual Day event. It required meticulous planning and coordination. Students prepared various dances, dramas, songs, etc. The entire preparation period was such a good time when I got closer to these kids. On the day of the event, seeing the parents’ faces light up with pride and joy as they watched their children’s talents on display was completely priceless.",
      "No matter how many years pass, Prayas will always hold a special place in my heart. The small excuses the kids made, their naughtiness, and their cute, innocent explanations and questions are unforgettable. The work at Prayas was immensely fulfilling, giving me a sense of purpose and a deeper appreciation for the value of education. The children and their families became an extended part of my life, and their progress and happiness are my greatest rewards.",
      "My grades were finally improving. I also secured an internship through the Student Placement Office at Vedanta Resources. This opportunity provided me with real-world experience, allowing me to see how the concepts we learned in the lab are applied at the industry level. The experience was transformative. It gave me a real-world perspective on my field and allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had gained..",
      "I also received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from Vedanta. Given the challenging job market conditions, I accepted the offer.",
      "Reflecting on my journey, the people I met at IIT Kanpur have been the best part. From struggling in my village to thriving on campus, the support and experiences I’ve gained are invaluable. I will cherish these memories forever. The support from my family, friends, professors, and the Prayas community has been instrumental in my journey.",
      "The friendships I made on campus are priceless. I found a group of supportive friends who shared my values and aspirations. We studied together, participated in activities, and supported each other through tough times. These relationships have enriched my life and provided a strong support system.",
      "The experiences at IIT Kanpur have been diverse and enriching. The lessons learned, skills acquired, and memories made will stay with me forever.",
      "My advice to juniors is to stay resilient and never give up. There will be times when things seem impossible, but perseverance and determination will see you through. Embrace the challenges and use them as opportunities to grow. Focus on your academics, but also explore other areas of interest. Participate in extracurricular activities and join clubs. These experiences will enrich your college life and help you develop a well-rounded personality. Build strong relationships with your peers and professors. They will be your support system and can provide valuable guidance and advice.",
      "Stay involved in community service and give back to society. It will not only make a difference in the lives of others but also provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose.",
      "Finally, believe in yourself and your abilities. You have the potential to achieve great things. Stay focused, work hard, and trust the process. Your efforts will be rewarded, and you will achieve your goals.",
      "This is my story—a tale of struggle, resilience, and triumph. Despite the hurdles, I stayed positive and motivated, and I hope my journey inspires others to do the same.",

      "In this 35th edition of As We Leave, Ritick Gupta, a Y20 student from the department of Electrical Engineering, shares his heartfelt journey at IIT Kanpur. Through his experiences in the Music Club, friendships, academic challenges, and personal growth, Ritick paints a vivid picture of campus life, emphasizing the importance of seizing every opportunity and making unforgettable memories",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "“It’s 10 in the morning. I am alone in my dorm, sitting beside my bed and thinking of all the hardest goodbyes over the past two days. All my best friends have left except one more, who is leaving today. Meanwhile, a gentle wind flows through the empty corridor, entering my room and waving my messy hair. I could hear the rustling of the leaves which reminded me of the days we spent together at the same place, screaming, laughing, fighting and enjoying ourselves together like never before. The corridor was never that quiet before and it seemed as if it was insisting me to call my friends back to slam on their doors, run around, shout and make this place lively. I went deep into my thoughts to where this journey started.”",
      "Hey there!",
      "I am Ritick, you might have seen me walking past OAT with a guitar bag and a bag pack. Some might recognise me through MClub, my obsession with Guitars, some know me through my voice, some call me a seriousness breaker and I am also known for producing noise pollution at times. Yes, it’s from the high gain stuff ofc 😉",
      "These 4 years of my stay at IITK were majorly shaped by my friends and my interests. The beginning was overwhelming for all of us due to the well-known “pandemic” but yes, we all survived. We heard our seniors talking about their bucket lists during their stay at campus, for us going to campus was itself the first item on our list.",
      "It was finally in December 2021, the first item on our bucket list was checked out. The joy of experiencing the campus in real life could be seen on everyone’s faces. We were already sophomores but behaved like freshers, took pictures of almost everything we saw around, roamed around, made new friends, and enjoyed our new hostel lives.",
      "I had known many people during my online semesters within the wing, my branch and the club but I didn’t have many close friends. The first person with whom I started to spend most of my time was Manas, he was the one who introduced me to most of the people whom I know now.",
      "Yes, he was also the roommate of ourresponsibleneta Sheeshram.",
      "We all spent most of the time together struggling to manage loads of things at once.",
      "Days passed, we grew up, got wise and began to settle. It was this time when we had to decide on which group we wanted to continue from now on. I was involved in various clubs/societies like IITK Motorsports, Music Club, Drams, Udghosh and whatnot. In the online mode, all of them were much easier to handle but offline we had to be physically present. In the end, I had to choose just one of them. After a lot of thought, I finally continued to Music Club as I loved playing Guitar since my childhood.",
      "The first thing which I wanted to do as soon as I reached campus was to perform on the OAT stage. Well, it was the time, the music club opened after 2 years of lockdown and we got to meet our club members in person.",
      "Everyone had the excitement to witness live performances again and were tired of doing online covers. Most of us participated in our first offline Musical Extravaganza ’22, we experienced the rigour of the run-throughs and understood that the club was much more than we anticipated. Finally, I got to feel the stage again after so many years and yes, the experience was surreal.",
      "I will never forget those Chai and Parathas after the run-throughs till 4 in the morning when everyone was exhausted and also had an 8 am class. The stage fear that kicked in when you are about to take the first note on your guitar with your friends in the audience waiting to listen to a song, they won’t even understand was just a unique experience.",
      "Events like Inter IIT, Mood Indigo and Synchronicity added to the overall flavour of the MClub because that was a time when we also had a chance to make “Our Music”.",
      "I remember we had around 10 days left for MoodI, most of the band members were still enjoying their holidays and our Original Composition was yet to be made. When everyone was back, we had to work 18hrs straight for a week to accomplish that. I would still remember Aarush giving us some 3 & 5 polyrhythm with a weird notation on drums which was conclusively a 4-4 with some accents. Me and Anisurya pondered on it for a long time just to transcribe it on our guitars while Akshat was sleeping on the keyboard as we didn’t have anything else to add to our song.",
      "The whole prep gave me an understanding of how difficult it is for an Artist to make a full-blown song. To be honest, our final song was actually the 5thiteration of 5 completely different songs, coz why not 😉",
      "My stay on campus was hugely influenced by the Music Club. I got to meet amazing folks like Shivang who was always ready to fight with me and at the same time, was always there for me. I met amazing juniors like Raghav, Vedant and Rajat who had an amazing heart. I got to meet Agam and Rajit who were always ready to organize a football match, even after late run-throughs. Agam literally made an amazing poster for our last club football match.",
      "MClub was the place where I got to interact with my batchmates, seniors and juniors. It didn’t only shape me as a musician but also gave me the skill of time management. Of course, in the initial stages, I suffered a bit but later I got a hold of it. The club gave me a platform to outshow my musical abilities, interact with other musicians, expand my taste and knowledge of music.",
      "I am so grateful to everyone who was there as part of my journey at the Music Club, IIT Kanpur.",
      "My days were mostly occupied with Classes in the morning, my friends in the evening and the Music Club at night. Well, I realised a bit late that I didn’t even consider keeping track of my studies which was the first motive of coming to campus.",
      "The acquaintance of the dreadful 4thsemester of Electrical Engineering still hits me. Most of my friends were on the same page, sacrificing their acads due to their commitments. Of course, we all suffered with the grades but then we all had to make some tough decisions regarding our commitments which helped us in smoother semesters henceforth.",
      "Across the semesters, I got a chance to explore a bunch of things. One of them is Research. When I was a child, I remember the Director of my school asking me once about what I would do in future to make her proud and I answered her by saying that I wanted to discover something new. Listening to this, she giggled a bit while my friends laughed heavily. Well, I got a chance to do something similar, it’s not much of a discovery but yes, it is of course some unique addition to the present literature.",
      "As a part of my coursework, I have done various UGPs under my Professor, Dr. Twinkle Tripathy from Electrical Engineering itself. She was the one who guided me throughout my research journey, and I am blessed that I got such a nice professor who made my own Research Paper possible.",
      "Ma’am is the one who taught me to believe in my abilities and I would always admire how humble and calm she is.",
      "Well, the curious ones can access our paper here:ACC 2023, IEEE Xplore",
      "As the semesters passed, I began to know myself better and discovered new people. We were initially a group of four friends struggling with the subjects, skipping classes, making mistakes, learning and moving forward together. Later, our group expanded and I got to meet some amazing people. I must say that I have one of the most diverse groups of people who complement each other in one or the other way. Someone is totally a tubelight(no offence 🙂 )while someone is just next level. One is understanding while the other is just a free bird. Someone is always cheerful while the other one is always overthinking and millions of similar such combinations.",
      "I will always remember how unique our birthdays were, the cake was not even allowed to be touched by the birthday boy and snatched by hands. Well, those dreadful GPLs are always a must, in addition to that, one of my friends had his butt on fire with an aerosol alongside the chappals. I won’t even forget that “Completely Random Guy” whom I met in my 6thsemester. These Azeeb folks almost convinced me to be the Dulhan for “Hall 1 Ki Barat” and were even ready to wear saris. I won’t forget Wardhan for what he did to my graffiti. Those fights with Manas about his so-called “Noise Pollution”, my Lappu sa Sachin and Umesh who was the saviour would always be remembered.",
      "I am grateful to have these folks with me, they are the ones who complete my heart and we are the strongest together. The fact that the solution to any of your problems is just a doorstep away will be the most valuable thing which would be missed about campus.",
      "I must say that IITK is the best place I have ever been, the people, the environment, the vibe and the opportunities make this place invaluable. The most important thing which I have learnt is that there are no limits to what people here can do. People here don’t settle and always experiment with their limits. They keep growing and once in a while, you can always find someone who has just accomplished something amazing.",
      "I got to learn a lot from these people and would suggest that if you ever find someone like that, go forward and interact with him/her. You would always be enlightened with something new from which you can learn and grow.",
      "It’s always better not to sit all day inside your room or be in the library the whole day. Roam around, and explore various clubs, games and teams because it’s the people who would help you grow faster as there might be someone or the other who would have excelled in the same thing you are doing right now. Learn from them, ask them and pass on the same to your juniors.",
      "There’s a lot more to write about the plethora of experiences we all have had but still I would like to conclude my not-so-interesting AWL by saying that,",
      "“Think wisely and be decisive about each step you take because in the end,it’s you who can make these four years count.”",
      "Thank you",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Reflecting on four years in just a single sitting cannot do them justice. Over the course of these years, I’ve evolved through various personas: the one who cries “F toh nahi lgega” and then gets a C+, the one who’s perpetually worried about placements, the one with a less-than-stellar track record in relationships (until recently :P), the one who wants a big fat friends group, and so on. However, for this time, I want to share what I wish someone had told me when I first got admitted to IIT Kanpur.",
      "Today, as I move to a new city to start my first ever job, I feel the same butterflies I felt during my (online) orientation. Beginning a new journey, whether it’s starting pre-school or beginning a career, comes with its own set of expectations for ourselves and our surroundings. As we grow with these experiences, it’s the people around us who turn an unfamiliar journey into a pleasant adventure and make a strange place feel like home. However, finding the right people isn’t always easy.",
      "When I began college, I sought out many seniors to ask for their experiences and advice. Like most freshers, I had the cliché goal of changing my branch. I looked up to seniors in circuital branches, believing they were the ones to follow, to achieve success. At that time, success meant having an extraordinary academic record and securing a 30+ LPA CTC placement. Over the years, my definition of success has evolved, but back then, it was clear-cut.",
      "I WISH someone had told me thatyou don’t have to follow every piece of advice you receive.The advisor might be the most ‘chaapu’ and ‘sorted’ senior or batchmate, but that doesn’t mean their advice will suit you. This doesn’t mean you should dismiss their suggestions either, but rather decide for yourself what will be beneficial. You’ll be surprised at how many different paths can lead to success. You don’t have to follow the path set by your seniors; you can forge your own.",
      "When you are in your first year, you have so much scope to explore the things you may want to pursue later. But talking to seniors who try to project their incomplete dreams on you in the form of ‘must-do’ is more damaging than helpful. For a long time I misidentified these ideas as my own dreams, but I learnt the hard way that it is you and only you who can and ‘should’ decide what you want to become.",
      "Despite all this, it is true that life becomes much easier if you have good people to help you at every step. I have often found peace in seniors who listened to my issues with an open mind and gave advice which best suited me.",
      "Token of Thanks: Thank youAnkitfor listening to my constant BT. I can assure you, I do much less RR now. Thank youSaadfor helping me throughout placement season, be it solving DSA questions from Japan or listening to my “Agar place ni hue toh?” BT.",
      "For a long time, I struggled between what I thought I should do and what I truly wanted. I poured all my energy into planning my college life based on a narrow idea of success, mainly focusing on getting a placement and prioritising it over everything else. I remember asking a senior BEFORE the beginning of classes in semester 1, “Coding kaise start karun? Abhi se karungi toh headstart milega naa.” Now when my juniors ask me similar queries, I find myself chuckling at their innocence but it also makes me sad becausecollege has so much more to offer than just placements.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youAmmafor hosting Zoom meets that brought college life to our doorstep, for enduring my endless chatter for hours on end and for always making me feel at home away from home.",
      "Thank youSanyamfor always answering the silliest of my questions, for always listening to my cry for help, for being my constant source of inspiration and for always being there. You are the best senior anyone could wish for.",
      "By the end of first year, I already had 3 projects in my ‘resume’, an accomplishment which even fourth-year students often struggle for. But in the process, I became more and more obsessed with enhancing my resume further. I desperately wanted to join SnT teams and clubs, viewing each addition as another point in my resume.Now I can see the problem with pursuing these PORs solely for the sake of resume-building.You’ll not find as many opportunities to explore your passion anywhere else as you will in college. Looking back, maybe if I hadn’t left the Music Club in the desire for what I felt were more prestigious PORs, I would have been much happier. And honestly, I don’t think it makes much of a difference anyway. In the end, you just fail to do justice with both them and yourself.",
      "All of this culminated in my worst fear coming true: I didn’t secure an internship. Despite receiving tons of shortlists, I just couldn’t crack ANY interviews. After a while, it felt like my friends, family, and even I believed something was inherently wrong with me. There were days when I wished my parents would tell me they were proud of me no matter what, instead of questioning what went wrong in the interviews, and acknowledge that I was working hard.",
      "In hindsight, not getting an internship turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The fear of failing is often worse than failure itself because once you face it, the only direction to go is up. Securing an off-campus internship eventually gave me the confidence I needed and helped me realise that life is much more than just this rat race. Ultimately, the placement semester became the best semester of my college experience. I hustled through the placement season with overwhelming support from my friends, both in preparing and having fun afterwards.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youSarath, SmritiandBaishaliand the entireFACfam for being an absolute blessing to work with.",
      "Thank you,Disha, for being the first person I talked to in college, my first roommate, and for putting up with my late-night yapping sessions.",
      "Thank youSwetafor enjoying chicken with me as much as I do, for being that one friend who I can always rely on for the best advice and for being a constant source of awe and inspiration. You are my one ‘turu lob’.",
      "",
      "",
      "But I wasn’t always good at making friends. I felt quite isolated throughout my school life, which motivated me to transform my social life in college. And college was definitely different. I met some extraordinary people who taught me so much. However, even college friendships came with their own hardships.",
      "For a long time, I stayed close to friends who were no longer compatible with me. The fear of losing them outweighed the pain of keeping them around. It’s hard to imagine letting go of people we care about, but recognizing that not every friendship is healthy, despite how good the person is, is one of life’s hard lessons. Learning when to let go is a skill I’m still working on, and I hope you will master it soon too.",
      "Nonetheless, having friends who believe in you can make such a huge difference. Being around the right people is always so rewarding and healing. I believe that friendships should be simple, where you can find your safe space. I’ll forever be grateful for the friends who pulled me out of my lowest points and helped me find myself again.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youSubbufor tolerating me through my ‘Drama Queen’ phase. Now never call me that ever again 🙂 .",
      "Thank youShantanufor sending me countless cat reels and for teaching me what being responsible truly means. I hope corporate life treats you well XD.",
      "",
      "One feeling that has forever overshadowed my campus experience is the sense of not doing enough. Transitioning from being one of the toppers in school to being just average in college became one of my biggest insecurities. I always felt the need to do more and prove to myself that I still had what it takes. I yearned for academic validation, but it eluded me until much after I realised that the metric of success is multidimensional.",
      "Let me tell you a story. At the end of my third semester, I received my first ‘D’ in ESO202: Mechanics of Solids. In retrospect, ESO202 was the worst course I ever took. Things improved from that point on, but at that moment, I hit rock bottom. I suddenly became the kind of student who gets D’s. Although I did receive D’s later on, the initial shock wasn’t as severe because I had already experienced it before.",
      "For a long time, I felt an immense burden of regret over that D. I thought, “If I hadn’t received that D, maybe I would have had an 8+ CPI, and a hundred other things could have been better.” However, a shift in perspective can transform the narrative significantly. That semester, over 100 students received D’s, E’s, or F’s. If I had received an E or an F, my academic trajectory might have taken a severe downturn. There’s a good chance I would have lost confidence, seeing myself as a student who gets F’s.",
      "Looking back, I realise that D saved me. It prevented a worse outcome and became a turning point in my academic journey. Today, I am proud to say that my CPI only improved from there on.",
      "Shifting my perspective has been incredibly refreshing. Now, I no longer carry the burden of regret for not being able to switch my branch, for facing rejection in my pursuit of becoming a CTM, or for missing out on an SPO internship—events that once brought me countless tearful nights. Undoubtedly, failure brings its share of pain, yet there’s no greater satisfaction than rising above that pain and discovering an alternate path to happiness.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youOjsi, Payal, Khoobayshee, Sweta, Adit, Naman, Bharat, Shivangand many others going through the ‘phase’ for making our department bearable.",
      "",
      "And thus, one day, it dawned on me how much the quality of life changes the moment you become aware of what you have achieved. After churning through the preparation for JEE, we never really get out of that constant hyper-competitive mode where nothing feels enough. Even now, as I’m about to start working at a company I actually want to work for, I still feel restless about doing nothing. It’s just how we’ve become. But in this process, we often forget how far we have come.",
      "I had a habit of overthinking and reevaluating every step of my life. God knows how many times I’ve wished to go back to my first day of college, where you are right now, and start over. “This time I would do nothing other than study! I would change my branch to CSE, then take a research internship abroad in my second year, secure a high-paying internship in an HFT, and finally receive a PPO from there.” It has taken a very long time for me to appreciate where I am now.",
      "One day, while casually overanalyzing stuff, I realised that maybe I don’t want to change things. If I really restarted my journey, I wouldn’t be who I am today. The friends I have and the memories I’ve made are too valuable to be replaced. And so, this cycle of overthinking stopped altogether.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youJahnfor bearing all my ‘small’ jokes and for being tiny XD. Thank youPrabhfor being the soul of every gathering and the best listener to all our problems. Thank youVyavfor being my go-to-person for anything and everything, from discussing ontology to recommending skincare, from eating biryani to drinking coffee and from hating on others to loving each other.",
      "You all are the best ‘mahila mandal’ anyone can ask for.",
      "Yes, it surely would have been good if everything had gone as planned. But there will always be possibilities where things could have been better than the present: a better college, a better branch, better decisions, and so on. However, consider what might have happened if you hadn’t made it this far. In some alternate universe, you might be in a private college, wishing you had made it to IIT Kanpur.",
      "From that perspective, I did live the dream, and so will you. Just remember, for every possibility where you could have done better, there are a thousand more where you would have been wishing to be where you are at the moment. After four years of experiencing the ups and downs of college life, I can emphatically say that I wouldn’t give it up for anything.",
      "Token of Thanks:And finally, Vijay ‘DJ Discobaz’ Bharadwaj, thank you for waiting for me every time I was late, for bringing me medicines everytime I had a tummy ache, for always being there no matter the time and for believing in me when even I couldn’t see the good in myself. Every moment with you has been pure joy.",
      "So, my dearest Small – Shreya, I wish that you have the courage to maintain a positive outlook, even when times are at their darkest. May your heart stay strong, and may hope guide you through the toughest moments.",
      "I am proud of you. Always.",

      "In this 30th edition of As We Leave 2024, Ishita Vyavahare, a Y20 student in the Department of Physics, takes us through a wild ride that was her college life and then tops it off with a bunch of sage advice that you can keep with you.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I wasn’t going to write an AWL until some of them came out and I realised that I had a duty to write something that told my story. Truth be told, I don’t think I can summarize my college experience in a neat 2000 words all wrapped up with a bow tie. Even if someone held a gun to my head and asked me to, I would write different versions of it depending on what time of the month it was. I don’t think I can recall everything I did in college will leave that up to the older Ishita whenever she goes into nostalgia mode. I like to think that every event changes us, reinforcing and dismantling the beliefs we have, so, every instance of college is now distilled into what (anti)lessons I have learnt.",
      "I did everything college had to offer. I religiously studied to get an A*, I slacked off to the extent that I didn’t know the name of the course till midsem, I bawled my eyes out when I couldn’t get an intern and had to stay for the summer and I smiled for days on end after having climbed the highest points in the campus, I dyed my hair pink and filled notebooks trying to feel better, I added nearly 1500 songs to my Spotify library in 4 years and I made a girlfriend family amidst self-doubts and isolation I felt after the falling out of my friend groups. I had a complete character arc in a movie that I thought to be a tragedy but was actually a coming-of-age.",
      "Me? I came in a frigid and insecure little girl, fresh outta the rat race constantly wanting to make a name for herself and simultaneously blend into the new ass-kicking machine that was this college. My first year saw me being oblivious to academic sensibility. No matter how much I tried to study the courses, I found myself scoring no more than average. It wasn’t until the midsemester exams that I realised thatiss college me koi doodh ka dhula nahi hai.Answers ke behti ganga me mere haath paav aur muh, sab dhul gaye.Make no mistake, I came to IIT Kanpur with dreams of being an academic weapon and graduate an accomplished scientist, but somehow no matter how much I tried, any effort to make meaning of anything was blotted out by the endless waves of the lockdown. Each day felt like just like any other seeing the same four walls of my room and being chronically online obsessing over pop artists and existential writers. Some things helped. I made some like-minded friends from college who to this day are with me and by me. Online clubs were actually an excuse for zoom calls of a bygone IITK practice known as “bulla sessions”. I got neck deep into yoga (excuse the pun) and the six dog walks a day were an excuse to see daylight. This is definitely an oversimplified and reductionist telling of my first year but the essence was just this. Numb days with virtually (killing it with these puns) four real faces to see; one of which was my dog, the rest three are with me in a whatsapp group called “genetically related peepl”.",
      "In the first half of the second year, things started turning heating up and sides were getting polarized. People anticipated, aspired and assured themselves for campus to reopen its gates as the rest of the nation did. I remember the endless streams of memes, confessions, chat spamming that pushed the college authority to resume their normal mode. It was a fateful PHY101 online class where the professor gave us the unintended disclosure that the college will open sooner than later. I am the believer types and the prospect of seeing college made me excited. The rest is history.",
      "Seeing all my friends and this batch of 1200 faces was a little bittersweet. You see, the internet puts you in an echo chamber of people like you, who use the same slang as you, who listen to your cool-deep-meaning-but-chill-rock-rap-beats kinda music, who are politically and socially pretty much homogenous. I realised in campus the sheer enormity of the type of friend groups, course choices, club and council choices, conversation choices, dressing sense choices, food choices, sleep schedule choices, humor types, attachment styles, priorities, backgrounds and chai preferences. This was a simulation of the real world. So many people turned out to be vastly different in appearance and demeanor than their online selves. Coupled with this was the huge break that Sincere Studying™had taken in my life. You know? The kinds where you enter a flow state and can’t stop? Anyways, I questioned if my career-choice and the life I had envision is still what I wanted. I fucked around and tried to find out. Fourth semester went by in the blink of an eye and it brought even more questions and a truckload of self-doubts. I honestly became morose in college, I yearned to learn something but I couldn’t figure out what I wanted and was constantly overwhelmed. I went back home for the summer and decided to truly start Sincerely Studying™. I took on the POR of my dreams (ELS coordinator) I also changed how I looked, dispelled with the things that made me hate myself and came back for my third year feeling fresher than ever. For the lack of a better term, I had a glow up.",
      "Third year saw me scrambling to have the research intern of my choice and struggling to keep up, yetgoddaminitagain to understand my courses, feeling more and more socially inept and unable to do justice to the POR I had. Most of my friend groups had fragmented around then and even my one-on-one friendships were going through their own separate agnipariksha. Campus chipped into my armor one strike and one day at a time, my glow up felt superficial. I won’t lie, I had become familiar with this sinking feeling and almost found a sort of comfort in it. There was plenty of gen z humor and art that made me feel heard so I spent a year in this feeling. I questioned more than ever what I wanted to do with my life. The vision of me being a scientist was dwindling and I found myself drawn to fashion, music and politics because for once, something felt relevant to my life. I stayed the following summer, did courses strategically and introspected. A lyric stuck with me that spoke my language of pessimism but was at the same time, empowering, “God loves you, but not enough to save you. “I took the decision to sit in the coming placement season with a vengeance. This placement season was going to be my bitch.",
      "Enter seventh semester. Now more than ever, I Sincerely Studied™for tests. I also reconciled with friends and talked things out. I still had to shed off the traces of self-doubt but going in, but had I learnt to let go. I had anxious breakdowns but they waxed and waned. I think here is the time I had an attitude glow-up. I embraced happiness as a necessary part of anything instead of sitting in my pit of sorrow and took it one day at a time. Come December of 2023 and I bagged my first job with my first interview. I never held myself in high regard but that moment was precious and life-shaping. I felt happy plain and simple.",
      "The last semester was a spa session with my girls and herbal therapy all the way. I went on my first and last college trip. I was the chilliest, most easygoing I had ever been. I still probe that the question, “what is it that I want to do with my life?” to this day and I have made some headway. This was the closure I got from college. This place has shaped me but did not define me. I had, in my own right, had undergone a process of confrontational self-discovery and this ass kicking machine has made my glutes very resilient. You can end reading this AWL here and I suggest you do. Come back another day and maybe look at the rest of this piece with a clean palette.",
      "Here are a list of the lessons and anti-lessons that I learnt along the way. They are mostly one liners so make of them what you will.",

      "Mohammad Saad, a Y19 BS-MS student in the department of Physics, talks about his views on the mechanisms of IITK, the Student Senate, the Gymkhana and how he would like to see the campus community thrive.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Thanks for the above disclaimer; much needed. For me, an AWL is a message that someone would leave behind as they leave the campus. I write this with that background thought. A mirror to the life I tried to live. This piece will also remind me of my principles when I look back. Reading this, you might feel I am too old for my age. I agree with you. I do feel old, especially on this “young” campus. And I write this while taking my high BP and high heart rate pills and scratching my head, which has succumbed to severe hair fall. (To lighten the mood regularly, I have added some of my clicks around the campus, which you all liked. Since this is kind of a non-personal AWL, there is no point in putting my group photos.)",
      "I shall keep my life story short because I do not wish to make this the usual personal-life-AWL; you’ll have many of those with more profound lives. So, I got here into MechEngg. Did a bunch of stuff in my first year (clubs, GC, etc.), scored 0/50 in PHY103 midsem, and then changed my branch to BS PHY because I felt I wanted to do physics. I had no rational basis for doing so, just a belief that even if it turned out wrong, I’m capable of finding my way through. Then I did some department courses, realised that I like “studying” Physics, took a SURGE project, which got ruined. Entered 3rd year with zero progress, applied for an internship in over 100 places, got rejected from everywhere, spent 6th semester with academic and emotional losses, and then went home while the rest went for their internships. Meanwhile, I started a project under a new professor, which turned out decent. Continued that and decided to do a Dual Degree because I did not even have enough LoRs for PhD applications. Finally got selected for MITACS in 4th year, saw off my graduating friends, had a great summer, came back, decided to leave research and sit for placements, pulled out three days before resume submission, applied for PhDs, and after a long wait, got in.",
      "That was academics; non-academically, I kept on doing something or the other all the while. Became secy at a few places (specially SnT, which began my four-years-long and deep connection with SnT), then a coordinator at my beloved AstroClub, did Inter-IITs, unexpected leadership at Science CoffeeHouse in 4th year, taught at Prayas, and gave my blood to the department as a DUGC nominee. Somehow, through all of this, many people got to know me, and I got to interact with a gazillion souls. Can I say I fulfilled the childish fantasy of being “college famous”? Well, I don’t care. It just felt like I got fitted into the “godfather” role towards the end, which could be false, but I felt that way. This starkly contrasted with the identity crisis I felt in my first year, and I am happy that I could grow in that sphere. I mention this entire story just for the sake of that one reader who might be looking for answers to related questions and I could provide one—even a single one matters.",
      "Firstly, every senior you meet will call his IITK years “the golden era”. Y16s call the pre-Y17 era the best; you know why. Y19s call pre-covid times “the golden era”. I do not know about Y20/21. I prefer not to call my era the best. Were the pre-covid IITK years the best? Probably not. So, never fall prey to that gaslighting. It is better to discuss specific features that changed across two eras and then choose your poison.",
      "I believe elections at IITK should be paused for a few years to allow the campus to heal. Throughout my stay, I have not found elections beneficial to the community. We need student representatives but not elected ones, especially not on the votes gathered through an empty manifesto, substances, and friendship/community voting. Why should a random Joe with no interest or stakes in SnT vote for the SnT Gensec? How does his vote even matter in this case? Instead of laying my faith in the electoral system, I prefer to lay it in the council core team and the interviewing panel, even though they are not immune to corruption. IITK elections are a waste of resources and students’ money. During the 1-1.5 months of elections, all Gymkhana activities, even small club events, are restricted. All of this just to elect some clowns whose sole reason for winning was to grab an offer in a consulting firm because they could not learn to code in their four years.",
      "I can convince myself not to hate consulting roles (except that they have hijacked Linkedin with their superfluous gyaan posts), nor do I mind people taking up positions that would aid them in landing such a role. What bothers me is the rampantselling of consultancy, which had ill effects on the Gymkhana. Earlier, such firms did not come for placements, and a handful would apply off-campus. The campus was relatively better then. Now, they also hire in internship drive, worsening the condition further. Since the positions were taken only to get a consulting job, the position holder forgets his responsibilities once he lands a role. Why would he even care now? The incentive is now already acquired.",
      "The collective good no longer seems to be the reason for anyone taking up positions. It seems to be all just for the sake of a one-page resume. It pains me when a first-year kid asks how some XYZ club or Inter-IIT Tech Meet can help his resume. We have confined them to a narrow thinking direction, and then later on, they feel the perils of the “rat race” that we created.How can Takneek or Galaxy improve my resume?It is not supposed to. Do it for the sake of your interests, for your Hall. Get that Inter-IIT gold for your institute, for yourself. In doing so, pick up the skills to help your resume. I hope such a culture does not exist where an Inter IIT OC conveniently fills half of his resume with Inter IIT pointers even before the Inter IIT has taken place or even some ground-level progress has been made.",
      "In my opinion, freshers must participate in GC as long as they can manage themselves. But how will they participate? The counselling service will separate them from seniors for over a month: no GBM or preparation for Takneek. Isn’t this also a blanket action? Where is the outrage as it was in the case of the H13 warden banning female entry? The CS should instead focus on better training of SGs and AMs. Amongst the many SGs and AMs I have encountered so far, most SGs themselves are unaware of scholarships and academic structures, which are important to a fresher, and the AMs are least interested in teaching and helping individual cases. This is probably explained by the fact that the applications are mostly due to the “fear of missing out” if you are not an SG. I believe there must be a maximum income criterion for SG and CTMs. An upper-class sobo cannot possibly understand the perils of a lower class and is expected to be unaware of MCM and FBM.",
      "We have been imitating the West in many ways. So, why do we not take their career structure? No fully-fledged organised on-campus recruitments. You should be capable enough of landing a job yourself. In today’s date, getting rid of the placements might be a bit far-fetched. But at least we can try removing the dedicated internship drive, which is, at best, spoon-feeding. The first year goes into understanding the campus, the second year goes into worrying about “projects” for internships, and the third year onwards, placements start to hit. Students lose their confidence when they cannot get an internship in a dedicated drive, while others do. They do not realise that only 1/3rd were supposed to get one. So, are the IITs incapable of training their students into independent job seekers? That would be quite sad because, due to the advent of IITs, most central and state universities have fallen deep into negligence today while once they were the nation’s charm. If the University of Allahabad were once called “Oxford of the East”, it would have been for a reason.",
      "This leads me to the current status of academics at IITK. In a few words, it can be better and tougher. I’d prefer to have quality over quantity. I’ll state this beforehand: I am all in to have proper regulations to counter professors’ and admin’s autocracy. This piece is to be read by students, so there’s no point in discussing the other side. I feel that, over the years, fewer and fewer students are going forward with their majors. Not being interested in the parent domain is fine; it is a class 12th kid’s decision, after all. But what appears to me is there are no efforts to develop an interest at all. Seemingly, the already set and prevalent path is a common choice. Most of the UGs do not even care about their major. They only want a professor not to teach, easy grades, and an easy graduation. There should be more Fs, you don’t get sad because you got an F, you get sad because very few got an F, and you were among them. The institute has even scrapped the termination policy for the UGs; after some semesters, you’ll be thrown out of campus (maximum residency), still slogging over your degree, and they’ll milk the money out of you. However, I should say that the Exit Degree Option is indeed a good initiative.",
      "A better support structure should exist for those who genuinely find academics difficult even after trying. But, if you say a professor is horrible for giving an F in your last semester while you did not even care to put in effort, you are objectively wrong. An IITK student of a specific subject with not even an ounce of subject knowledge should not be allowed to graduate and tarnish the name of the degree. I know professors who went out of their way to teach the students who found difficulty learning despite their efforts, but they were defamed because they graded slightly harsher than a professor who distributed free grades. There are too many fests and other non-academic events throughout the year. And while you invoke that cliche Dead Poets Society quote, I agree non-academics and entertainment are essential. But not in this sheer quantity in an academic institution. Our time and efforts are better suited to other avenues rather than self-indulged frolics. The ever-increasing batch size is another nail in the coffin. Resources are the same, classrooms are getting bigger, and the quality is decreasing. IITK should not be just a job centre but an education hub. The former follows along. And education that does not serve the community is futile",
      "As I leave, I just request you to be vigilant, vocal, and proactive about the activities around you, whether admin’s or Gymkhana’s. Keep your position holders in check, especially your executives and your senators. You should step up and ask how an item worth a lakh or two suddenly gets lost and then written off from the inventory. It came from your Gymkhana fee. When I entered IITK, I thought it wouldn’t be corrupt like other government setups. But I was wrong. From admin to students. Tell me, how many of you have faked income certificates to get MCM or Donor, even though you know you’ll earn well after graduation if you work the bare minimum? And this is just one of many things. Also,make good friends in the senate. In my judgment, the 2023-24 UG AnC Gensec did negligible work in the tenure, and no one moved an impeachment, but hell went loose when a PG got duly elected as the Chairperson. The long-forgotten Gymkhana Constitution was returned to life to get the new chair ousted. I am indifferent to the person or his/her credentials; it is the procedure and partial treatment that upsets me.Dosti-yaari senate much?The SSAC, supposed to be a judiciary, has been turned into a threat machinery.",
      "I do not know much about Y18s and above, but I did observe the destructive precedence of arbitrary power abuse and political control set by the Y19 executives. That precedence has been successfully taken up by the Y20 executives and made even worse, as could be seen in the 2023-24 Even semester. (I think executives should leave campus as soon as the end of their exams; their prolonged stay has proven harmful). What scares me is how far the Y21s will take it, I pray they don’t. In an environment with healthy journalism, individual whistleblowers would not be needed. The Vox had been on its deathbed under the Y18s and Y19s. I commend their recent recovery, which has been a ray of hope. But I feel their ethos much constrains them, and they need to let it loose, albeit with the faith that their biases are away, and thus, do journalism with a spine.",
      "So who are the culprits? Your executives, the senate, the position holders, you and me. All of us are. We, the seniors, have glorified multiple PORs as chaapuness. We, the seniors, have glorified only high packages as success. We, the seniors, have made the juniors think only about their resumes. We, the seniors, have taught our juniors how to play dirty politics, so much so that it might ruin a student’s career. The onus is on the seniors to set good precedence for the juniors. If the students say the admin woke up after three suicides, then the students also woke up after three suicides. It is easy to make an outcry in heated blood, but the need is for systemic efforts from our side to bring reforms — incremental efforts in our own spheres: committees, clubs, councils, and so on. I have tried to be indifferent but still feel for this place. Yes, I would love to see my IITK be great.",

From navigating the challenges of a new environment to finding his passion in dramatics, he shares the unexpected twists, cherished friendships, and valuable life lessons that shaped his years at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It was 14thJune 2019, results of JEE Advanced just declared and the dream of yet another JEE Aspirant got shattered. Well, it was one of the toughest phases since my family expected a lot from me. My scores in Mains & BITSAT were not good enough either. I started searching for what other options I have. A State Rank of 90 could only get me admission in the CSE Department of the best private college of Chhattisgarh, BIT Durg. I still remember the staff saying,“1stAugust se classes hai, subah 9 Baje aa jana”.",
      "It was something I never imagined having happened to me. On 10thJuly, I decided totake another shot at my life, the last phase of Allen’s droppers’ batch was beginning from 17th. Grateful and glad that my parents supported me blindly in this decision of mine. Booked the tickets for 15th, reached Kota on 16th, joined classes from 17thJuly’19 and never looked back again.",
      "Our classes officially commenced on 18thNovember’20 and a tragedy followed immediately. I lost my grandfather on 19thNovember, Covid proved to be a boon in the sense I could rush to my hometown and be there with my family in their toughest phase, especially my father.",
      "I lagged in academics and missed out on most of the fun events that followed for obvious reasons, and I really don’t regret it at all, the last rites of my grandfather were of utmost importance during that phase and my father needed me the most that time.",
      "I missed out so much that I was added to my department WhatsApp group post first Mid-Semester Examinations. I hardly knew anyone in the college apart from my wingies. However, the MSE group welcomed me quite warmly and I finally had my first set of friends by the end of first semester. I too started having all night online Bulla Sessions with them and finally found a way to escape from the concept of‘fear of missing out’.",
      "I never cheated during my 1styear at college and proudly accepted myCsin MTH & PHY103 andDin LIF. I was still in the delusion that I have conquered JEE and that’s it, my life goal is achieved, it doesn’t matter what’s your CPI here, after all you’re an IITian, this was soon broken when I reached campus on 30thDecember’21.",
      "Post reaching campus, things changed drastically, especially for our Batch, Y20s. Most of the people came to know that who were theirrealfriends, as once you are offline, your priorities are no more private to you, they become public, and it was hard for many people to digest the fact that the equality of our set of online friends & offline friends did not hold true.",
      "However, I was lucky/grateful enough that I always had my wingies to fall back upon and my online interaction was limited to very few people, which made the transition easier.‘Always expect the worst and you’ll end up staying happy’,is one of the Ideologies that I believe in, expectations kill joy.",
      "I had performed in my school a lot and wanted to explore dramatics here too. It was in online mode that I became the Secretary of the Dramatics Club. It was definitely a huge learning curve and I’m glad/proud to have taken that decision, no regrets at all. Well, things changed quickly and drastically when we came offline as secretaries of Fursat Mandli. The long practice hours were something very new to me, but I enjoyed the interaction and the common goal of learning & growing as artists held us together.",
      "Not everything was so smooth, we had to mentor Y21s in a fresher event and every 2-3 secretaries worked as a team by having a set of juniors as mentees. A multilogue and a sketch was to be performed by them under our guidance. In one of the online meets, while mentoring and giving tips to improve to Y21s, I fumbled, I fumbled bad, even said lines which were not meant to be, I immediately turned my video and mic off, just listened thereafter, my team handled it well after that, but I fell into the deepest well of self-doubt. That phase was tough, and I kept doubting what impression the Y21 batch would be having of me, that mole of self-doubt, though much smaller now, still remains.",
      "One can always make mistakes, even while mentoring, be it a senior from any batch, after all we’re human beings, what matters is how you take it, you can be in an endless loop of self-doubt or decide to move on and forget it as a bad dream, which is definitely not easy, you just need to be around people who believe in you & lift you up. Talking it out to them may be tough, but it’ll definitely be helpful.",
      "Nevertheless, once the Covid outbreak settled in campus, we were all set to perform our first Nukkad Natak, ‘Koop Manduk’. What a blissful experience it was, I consider it as a privilege, not everyone gets it, especially under the tag of ‘Fursat Mandli’. The endless night outs of practice, Y19s, Y18s even Y17s in their last few days at campus, were all putting everything they could to make us learn what actuallyDramatics Club, IITKused to be (before Covid). The Chai-Aloo Paratha breaks between practice gave us yet another core memory, the experiences that Y17s-Y18s shared was worth listening to, Y19 Coordinators were always there for us. The energy of the people there is surreal.",
      "Performing a Nukkad, makes you ready for the toughest situation you’ll ever face in campus, the bonds that you make, remain forever. I just performed one Nukkad in my entire time in Fursat Mandli and never went to practice post that due to my other priorities, yet the connections rather friendship remains, even in my final semester, they made me feel like I never left. No junior has ever seen me perform live & I missed performing again with these people.",
      "Once a senior said,‘Dramatics Club kuch nahi toh Time Management zarur sikha deta’and I can proudly second that now, by saying the same to my juniors.",
      "I have been extremely enthusiastic about cricket since childhood and played tennis ball cricket in my hometown, mostly as a fast bowler. After coming here, I decided to give it a try but professional cricket here was literally a different ball game altogether. It was the first time that I played with a leather ball.",
      "We were just in campus, around January’22, some of the cricket enthusiasts from our batch went to the PE Ground to explore the facilities we have. We went to the cement pitch in the nets and were playing with tennis ball as we used to play in our halls. One day, the institute team was practicing in the main pitch (open nets) and when we entered the ground, the coach called us and wanted us field for the team, although the ball was different, fielding is something I always enjoyed. Post the session, the coach asked us our expertise in the game, I said I’ll bowl leg spin, as I knew this ball was heavy and I cannot ball fast without proper control with it. But, as soon as I bowled my first leg spin delivery, I knew I’ll be thrown out of here as the bowl didn’t pitch, it directly reached the keeper’s gloves as if I was giving a catch. I tried again, no control. The coach then asked if I could do something else, then I told him that I used to bowl fast with the tennis ball. He said to try the same with this ball too, I was a bit anxious at first but thought that anyways I’ll be out so why not give it a shot. Then I took my run-up and bowled with all the effort I could, the ball pitched this time and bounced to a height no one expected, everyone looked with a shock, and the coach said to come again. I once again bowled and everyone was again taken aback with the pace the ball travelled, I couldn’t believe that it was this easy to bowl with the leather ball. The coach asked me to come for team practice from the next day.",
      "I bowled out the captain of the Institute Cricket Team during my first practice session & soon became a permanent member of the 16-member squad that represented IIT Kanpur in Cricket. I got my first gold medal in Udghosh’21 (1stto 3rdApril’22) without playing a single match, chicken dinner with zero kills as you may call it, kind of Khaleel Ahmed in this T20WC. This was followed by another gold in Spardha’21 (IIT-BHU Sports Fest: 15thto 17thApril’22) and yet another gold in Udghosh’22 (14thto 16thOctober’22), in which I had significant contributions. By the time we reached Inter-IIT, I was the lead pacer of the team, it was something I could not even imagine in my dreams. My first two overs in our opening match were maiden, first one being a wicket-maiden, though it didn’t matter much because we soon got eliminated in our first knockout game. That phase taught us a lot, maybe we were just too overconfident and considered others too weak.",
      "The next year’s UDGHOSH was meant to be forgotten, we stood 4th, nothing to be proud of as we lost two consecutive medal matches. I injured my left ankle & right groin during the last match of the tournament. Whenever I tried to practice, the pain would come up, even after days of resting. I wanted to play my last Inter-IIT anyhow, but I couldn’t even show up for a single practice game between Udghosh’23 (6thto 8thOctober’23) and Inter-IIT Camp (26thNovember), which made my chances of selection worse. But I wanted to play anyhow, then I figured out that if my leg fits very tightly in my shoes, my ankle won’t get strained, that was it. I wore 4 socks on my left leg along with an ankle support to start bowling. Eventually things started working out. My role was changed from an opening bowler to a death one. I knew my groin was weak, I wore crepe bandage tightly across my right groin too, to avoid any mishaps. I started playing some matches in the camp and was super happy that I was able to bowl with my full strength and also did justice to my assigned role, finally my ticket to Gandhinagar was confirmed. Meanwhile, my teammates and captain always had my back, they trusted me & my skills blindly.",
      "Then came the ultimate, IISM’23, in which we finally earned a podium finish. I played the entire tournament with the same setup, 4 socks & an ankle support on my left ankle & a tightly wound crepe bandage across my right groin. Though we completed our revenge with Madras in the 3rdPlace match, our team deserved to win Gold. We lost the semi-final against Roorkee by just 1 run, when 2 were required off the final delivery. I ended up being the second highest wicket-taker of the tournament. This tournament will always remain closest to my heart as I was not fit enough, yet the team backed me and brought the best out of me and ofcourse, we finally got an Inter-IIT Medal before leaving.",
      "I still enjoy bowling and very recently clicked approximately 135 kmph during a practice session. So, if you want to face some bouncers, I am always up at 9179234505.",
      "Cricket taught me that one should always try whatever he/she likes or has the passion for, you never know where you’ll land if you don’t even give it a shot. I never bowled with a leather ball before IITK.",
      "Well, after I was done with my secretary tenure at Dramatics and was finally settled in the Institute Cricket Team, it was now time to do what I dreamt of from 1styear.",
      "I would not be lying when I say that, from the day I became a Student Guide, I always wanted to become a Core Team Member just because things seemed so easy from their point of view, you just order the AMs/SGs and the job is done, I too wanted to do what they were doing. When I applied for the post of Core Team Member, I didn’t even know that there’s something called Position of Responsibility (PoR) in college and people can mention it in their resume, I was so underexposed.",
      "Well, things fell in place somehow and I was finally a CTM. The year after that was the most memorable one, I only knew 1-2 of my 21 teammates but soon after ‘WE’ clicked. My work ethics helped me gain respect from my colleagues, my coordinators too & soon I was friends with most of them, yet I would not say that I gelled up very well because I had my cricket practice all year along & that somewhat refrained me from giving those extra bonding hours to my team, yet they never ever made me feel left out & took good care of me all year along, after all it was CS.",
      "Guidance work was something I really looked up to, I loved talking to my mentees and it was one of the best things that CS did to me. When you talk to students struggling and know what they’ve actually gone/going through, your own life seems so simple and easy, you feel privileged, you start acknowledging/noticing all the small, good things that have happened to you and you become grounded. One must not always wish something to God, sometimes we just need to thank them for whatever has happened/is happening, if everything seems right, just thank them, you don’t always need to wish for things to happen.",
      "When we finished selecting our new Core Team (Y21s), I attended a few of their meetings. I admired them a lot, they gave me the motivation to climb a step higher and to go for the post of Coordinator, Counselling Service.",
      "When I became the Coordinator, I was much more confident than in the case of a CTM. I was a huge fan of all my co-coordinators who soon turned into my best friends on campus. I made up for the lost bonding hours this time. They were the four gems whom I’ve always looked up to & were always there whenever I needed them to be. My junior team was adorable, always super proud of them, they made me learn so much and honestly speaking, my coordinator tenure made me grow much more as a person than my CTM tenure, maybe because of spending more time together with the team, better connect with the Head, CS and of course hearing to the perspectives of my junior team, all added up. Writing of the junior team reminds me of Y22s, they’re even more adorable, glad about them already, they just make me feel older. My Team here (Y19s, Y20s, Y21s, Y22s) gave me perspectives that I could’ve never imagined and depths I would have never dived into, glad that I met them.",
      "From not getting an Orientation ourselves to conducting 4 Sky Photos (Y20, Y21, Y22 & Y23), we graduated. CS literally gave me the best set of people to bond to and connect with and I’ll forever be grateful for it. It was always about the people that make CS what it is, and I am really glad that I was a part of it.",
      "Will never forget the DE Practice sessions and the walks that followed during the last semester, yet another core memory.",
      "Honestly speaking, I never prepared properly for my internship drive. I focused on just doing the things which I had in my hand, in the best possible way. I was delusional and believed in the fact that I had enough on my resume, relied too much on those two gold medals, PoR of CTM & Secretary Dramatics Club and some normal SnT, PPOC projects, but I later realized that this was never enough for a Non-Tech profile. I hardly had any knowledge of DSA. Once the season started, I felt the importance of CPI too, it was 7.3 after my 4thsemester.",
      "Not getting shortlisted for interviews never really bothered me throughout the drive, I was happily enjoying the success of my Wingies and my co-Core Team Members. I was so engrossed in CS and my Cricket practice that I never focused on preparing seriously. I considered that I didn’t deserve an Intern as I saw others who had prepared seriously and are still struggling, that phase was more tough for them & I tried to help in every way possible. There was always a sense of self-doubt that my resume was really that bad that I didn’t even deserve an interview, but I had things which kept me busy and that helped, by not getting a chance/time to think about it.",
      "Soon the spring semester started, and I was yet to get a call for my first interview. Back of the mind I knew, this is the make-or-break phase and hence decided to leave cricket for this semester and focus on myself completely. Yet, even in Phase-II, there was not much movement. I enjoyed my MSE Labs a lot & wanted to explore the Core Sector. Schlumberger (SLB), Tata Steel, & SAIL were few companies in my mind that wanted to target and Vedanta & JSW had already hired.",
      "And luckily one fine day, SPO organized its first Placement Fest, called Samvardhan and SLB, previously Schlumberger came out of nowhere. The took resumes on a google form sent via mail and I was glad that could update it with my latest CPI of 7.5 and added all my MSE DEs in the relevant coursework section, I took four of them simultaneously in my 6thSemester to get ready for placements at least.",
      "My resume finally got shortlisted for the first time & I got to know this when I received 5 missed calls on my phone to come to the GD Round that morning. I knew that if I get shortlisted in any company, I’ll definitely convert it. I had that much self-confidence in me, though I never imagined that it’ll take so long to get an interview. My GD went significantly well, and I was finally called for my first Interview. It was a fun experience as I fumbled a bit when they talked around my projects but as they moved towards my achievements in cricket and tenure as a CTM, I gained the confidence back. I even delivered my only dialogue from ‘Koop Manduk’ during my interview. Finally, I ended up having an offer till the evening.",
      "One thing that Intern season taught me was, that if you are doing justice to what you’ve actually signed up for & doing it with full commitment, eventually things will fall into place in some way or the other. Enjoy others’ success and never blame someone else for your own shortcomings. Not giving up till the very end kept me going and I finally got my chances.",
      "My CPI after 3 online semesters was 7.5 and I was cruising smoothly around it (7.5, 7.6 and 7.4 in my first three semesters). Things got overwhelming when I got here. I was secretary at the Dramatics Club and a fresh member of the Institute Cricket Team too. So, from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM I had my daily cricket practice followed by Nukkad Practice from 09:00 PM to around 03:00 AM roughly. I was having real fun doing both the things simultaneously, but that made me miss my early morning classes (and sometimes dinner too) of MSE202, which is one of our toughest DC. My CPI was ready to take a blow and I ended up with an SPI of 6.8 in my 4thSemester. It was not just CPI that had fallen, my weight got down from 78 Kgs to just 65 Kgs during my first offline semester at IIT Kanpur.",
      "By now I knew that I had to give up some commitments, I became a CTM and enjoyed cricket a lot so had to suppress the desire of performing arts and with a heavy heart decided to not continue Dramatics anymore. The Club taught me the most though, be it punctuality, time-management and work ethics which helped me a lot in managing CS and Cricket together.",
      "I wanted to improve my academics without compromising both of my 3rdyear commitments at all. Plus, I never wanted to miss any of my classes & regretted a lot if it happened by chance. So, from my 5thsemester I decided that whatever be the scenario, I won’t be missing any of the classes. Also, during the academic hours, 09:00 AM to 05:00 PM, you are not bound by anyone, and no one will ever tell you to miss classes for any event/practice, at least from my experience in CS and Cricket.",
      "I did try the same and it helped me a lot during Mid-sems and End-sems. I did not just attend classes but also made notes & tried to get clear of the concepts taught, then & there itself. It was a bit difficult at times, especially during my 5thsemester but I tried. Finally ended up with an SPI of 8.0 and my CPI again reached 7.5.",
      "I followed the same strategy in my 6th& 7thsemester, but it was more robust this time and the courses too were of my interest, be it the 4 DEs in 6thor the 5 OEs in my 7thsemester respectively. Attending classes regularly and paying attention made my Mid-Sem and End-Sem Preparation much easier. It was mostly the night before and sometimes just a few hours before the exam that I started to study. It worked perfectly well again, and I ended up with very decent SPIs thereafter.",
      "So, the secret to time management is attending classes regularly and patiently listening to it too, I know your friends would be mad at you at times saying,‘Final year mein class kon jata hai’, but if you don’t want to compromise on your commitments as well as academics, it is the best possible way.",
      "In the end I’d just like to say that don’t regret whatever you do in your entire campus life, everything happens for a reason, and it’ll definitely make you learn and grow as a person in some way or the other. Explore whatever you’ve thought of doing on campus and do it as soon as possible, these 4 years will go in a snap and in our case, it was just 2.5. Your wingies will always be there irrespective of the situation you’re in, so try to be there for them too whenever possible, you’ll carry this special bond to places & for the longest of years.",
      "Many juniors ask that will this XYZ Club Secretary/Coordinator PoR help me in my internships/placements, which is quite natural. But please do remember that the only pre-req IITK asks/sets to be a member of any club is‘Enthusiasm’and the sole reason for that was the fact that people should come to clubs to explore their own interests in that respective field, to learn/know more about that, to interact with people with similar interests to widen their perspectives, to grow as an individual in multiple aspects and not to get an edge in Internships/Placements. It’s my humble request to all the juniors that don’t ever join a club/society/group for the sole reason that it’ll help you in your career, join it because that particular area/topic excites you, you’re very much interested in it, you feel relaxed there, you feel a sense of accomplishment, you like the work there or you just enjoy the vibe of the people/place there. Please #SaveTheCulture.",
      "Also, do explore relationships if you ever get a chance to, I feel college life is the best time for it and there’ll always be some selfish reasons to help/bond with you in your professional life to come. I personally wasn’t involved in any during my college years, but I did wish to at once, I had a crush since my 3rdsemester, glad I could stay loyal to her till the very end. I never confessed it to her (yet) but the way she handled me (& my weird efforts) and even reciprocated them was mesmerizing, probably the cutest girl I’ve ever met.",
      "I’m always available on +91 9179234505, be it reviewing resumes, preparing for GDs, getting insights on MSE Courses & Professors, ranting something out or even just chatting, you can always ping me!",
      "Thank you so much if you made/read it till here, I am super happy & glad that I could keep you engaged till the very end. I didn’t want to compromise on what all I’d like to share, that’s why I didn’t care about the number of words, sorry if it felt long. A very special thanks to Dhriti too, my AWL editor, for bearing me since 26th April’24, when I shared my first AWL draft to her, she’s been a constant support throughout, thanks Dhriti:) & sorry that I couldn’t cut down on the number of words:’(.",

As much as I can just ignore words and delve into yapping about how my college life was, I think some literary tomfoolery may help my case of a terrible attentional memory, which has basically made my academic journey since 2006 (when I joined pre-school) extremely drab-seeming in my own head.",

      "How? It seems to me as if only thoughts that are shared “as” the graduating batch graduates, matter.",
      "Only thoughts that are shared as “we” vacate, matter.",
      "That only thoughts that we invoke as we “leave”, matter.",
      "This is a collection of short anecdotal chunks, which are all BUT my thoughts “as” “we” “leave”.",
      "As.“While something else is happening.”",
      "While. Why just “while”?",
      "I have been blessed to be a ‘decently’ close part of IIT Kanpur’s cultural affairs. Not to be confused with the “campus culture”, but rather Media and Culture activities.",
      "I was good at what could be called a precursor to design. What kind? The drawing-and-sketching, ain’t-no-direction kind. Since high-school. I remember starving myself at home trying to attend a Zoom orientation about the Design and Animation Club.",
      "My journey to learning has been through a very freewheeling, self-exploratory route. I have played with things on my own, seized independence in creating fearlessly and attained pleasure in it – which I still uphold as the best way to learn anything, even after 4 years – be a kid about it. As James Victore says, in what is obsessively my favorite quote ever:",
      "The things that made you weird as a kid – make you great today.",
      "This has forever been my guiding principle.",
      "I discovered something about campus club affairs the day I had my Design and Animation Club Coordinator Interview.",
      "The realisation ofcoordiinterviews being a stress test than a gauge of how well you can propagate and inspire told a lot about how clubs are designed to operate. Them being about how club seniors take pride in being intimidating, and how suddenly operating a club stops being about passion and turns into managerial business, is something I find ugly.",
      "I believe culture is not business. Sure – to everyone who says you have to manage inventory, people, events, bills – I agree. But if you tell an artist to not make a castle out of playing cards “because” it’s fragile and can’t be transported to the exhibition, that’s some BS.",
      "And, this increasing emphasis to PoRs and getting white-collar opportunities by assigning tangible scores to being a Coordinator at X Club or Y Society enforces it further.",
      "For one, the exhibition comes second to the art. The exhibition enables the art, but doesn’t lead to it. The management should allow for creativity to show in a better way – not suppress it. Deadlines. Monetary limits. Pressure to show and create. “Ye kya hai?Why is it this way?” should not be hurdles to what the main purpose of a club (I believe) is – fostering multidimensionality in an otherwise unidimensional set of what I call trade-school “factory products” – as a senior often claims.",
      "You (the reader) mayagreeordisagree. I just seek from you tounderstand.",
      "I tried with THC to fix this (you may see a mention or two of it if you continue to read my ramblings), but I feel:",
      "Despite we leave, this mechanisation of club affairs may remain to be a sad reality.",
      "The paradox of departure is that I don’t think it is a singular event.",
      "I leftthe first timeI finished first year. It gave me a whiff of how college feels – the (beautiful) fragility of social circles, confidence …and the idea of merit.",
      "Being theacademictopper of my batch at school, it was hard for me to transition into cheating for academic credit. Trust me, I made notes for PE101. I learned. I am still bad at it, but I did just enough. Growing up with this fear of cheating on acads made me more self-reliant, albeit put me in unfavorable circles, as you could guess – cheating circles were really instrumental in creating friendships in an online semester.",
      "I leftagainwhen I returned home for vacations after my first offline semester. It showed me the contrast of what the world was going to be, and how different it was from where I stayed for so many years. It was an unsettling revelation about life after graduation. Even if I juggle between home and campus – what would I call home once I leave and pursue professional/further academic niceties?",
      "And so I have been leaving ever since – when I left campus for doing my internship at Bengaluru, my last lab course, when I furnished no dues at Hall 1, when each of my wingies started vacating their Hall 1 rooms, when my parents landed in Kanpur to pick me up and a thousand times more before I stepped foot into my house. And at home, I still do occasionally, most recently during the Manchester Derby, that I could have watched at A-315 with my wingies.",
      "However, I’d like to tell everyone how I learnt that leaving is the best way to give validity to your experiences – it only goes on to show how strong it actually made you, that you could imagine a life without it. Even if Caesar said that the valiant never taste of death but once, I believe no one is ever born valiant, and all of these deaths prepare you for your destiny.",
      "Before we leave, let’s all die a little.",
      "I have decided to write this section the way I should, because what I am about to say can’t stay unwritten, and reject my ideas of continuing this narrative the way I planned it to be, and instead, keeping important things towards the end.",
      "This graduation is going to end up in “them” leaving – people. Not just people, but peoplewithme,ina space like the campus, where I get to livethe same freedom and intentionwith them. It’s the complete package that I am surrendering to the uncertain future.",
      "This is impartial gratitude to:",
      "Edit: I thought I did something with the wordplay, and then the thing with my placement offer happened. Welp.",
      "Should my memory fail and I overlook anyone, anticipate a message from me. I should stop, lest this keeps going on and on. 😅",
      "As they leave, I sense a void that may not truly exist, yet I will never feel whole again.",
      "I am certainly leaving differently. I had the fortune of establishing The Hip-Hop Collective at IIT Kanpur, with some of the best people I could do it with.",
      "I remember when I first met Shivang [Jaiswal]. It was in Hall 3, where we were all fresh from the smears of the lockdown and ignited by the camaraderie of the resource-constraint crowd on campus. I found in him, a space for unwinding about my somewhat repressed yearning for hip-hop music, and later, alternate expression on philosophy, humans, society and intoxicants.",
      "We stayed together in the summer, and created music. One of our first tracks was titled “Why Are We Here”, we made it in a continuous session of around 24 hours, from a rough recording of a Music Club performance at CCD featuring Mayank [Mishra]. It was a newfound love of creation – and it felt different to how I used to create music. A lot of my old stuff (which is onstreaming platforms) was execution-focused, even if it came at the expense of artistic satisfaction. This was solely for the love of creating new stuff and fiddling with it – with no urgency for execution.",
      "The sample from the Music Club performance, chopped and composed for the final demo.",
      "Hence, things moved forward with this creative space flourishing.",
      "Shivang was associated with the Music Club, which he was seemingly growing out of, due to a clash of interests and a lack of palatability about a lot of ideas Shivang had. Naturally, as he was a producer, amongst singers and instrumentalists. The tumult started when Shivang, me and Mayank wanted to do a performance for the Freshers with Music Club, and there were contentions to how the club cannot represent “rapping” to “pre-recorded instrumentals”, or allowing non-members or people who say they “don’t do auditions” for the club. It felt to me as if there was an air of perceived disinclination to hip-hop as music, and we were motivated to find ourselves stage time in the midst of this challenge.",
      "We did, and we came up with The Hip-Hop Collective. I believed that any culture (here, any entity under the Media and Cultural Council) should allow for counter-culture, otherwise it ends up being just coercion. We had simple ideals: create with no fear of execution and failure. Creating willfully, limitlessly and exploratively in a collective environment allows for a liberatory exchange of ideas and leads to wonderful learning and artistic output.",
      "This is exactly how we enabled around ten absolute newbie Y22s who hardly had the sonic aptitude to listen and stay on the beat, to pull off an amazing Freshers’ performance and nail their bit bar-for-bar – in just under four days. We saw our hypothesis on learning and propagating culture come true.",
      "But what about me? I found love for creation. I saw myself in the kids we learnt how to rap with. I put myself in a space where I could feel the urge to learn more and push myself with these kids, than focusing on delegating and ordering for stuff to happen.",
      "As I leave, I am glad to have originated a haven for hip-hop culture at IIT Kanpur. Despite not having anyone to look up to myself, I am proud to have partaken in creating something that now leaves the campus with more role models for future batches to admire and be inspired by.",
      "Leave.As we “go away”? Are we going away?",
      "One of my biggest insecurities I had the first two years here, was whether I had made the right choice coming to IIT Kanpur.",
      "I had the opportunity of studying Economics at St. Stephens, and I was actually looking forward to joining (even the first year course handouts had started hitting my email!). It was only the gnawing guilt of “I didn’t grind through two years of JEE prep for nothing”, that I had to surrender my admission there.",
      "This letter, as you may see below, gnawed me for two whole years. It kept me distant from the identity of an IITian, or being proud of it.",
      "IIT Kharagpur, because I had a few rounds of counseling to go.",
      "I was conflicted, because I didn’t know where my creative pursuits would stand in the hyper-competitive milieu of an IIT, but also didn’t know how a DU college would do justice to my academic excellence (so far then) and people who said “Venkat ji ka beta IIT jayega”.",
      "Some of my fears did come true coming to IIT – unfair academic competition, a general automatism to resorting to the handful pre-set avenues for a job, and seeing it be reduced to an open reservoir of quests to collect resume points. I now believe it was my short-sightedness in associating such harsh thoughts with everyone who was doing so, but only if I could go back in time and fix my line of thought!",
      "Despite wanting to chase the so-called average IIT dream, I could not come to terms with it. I struggled, therefore. No branch change, no projects with professors, no fancy PoRs. I would frantically call up every senior I knew to tell them how I couldn’t figure out what to do in life. But it would never seem like I had enough time then to be able to tend to their suggestions.",
      "However, it was coming to me – how doing nothing just because I don’t like anything a hundred percent – was exactly the reason I felt the anxiety to even start. Shreya remembers me not even being serious about the internship drive, before something hit me that caused things to see an upward curve – the Bain shortlist. I remember not having put in a lot of effort to make that resume (in contrast to today’s standards), but getting that shortlist gave me a nudge that maybe I was missing out on so much, just because I was not trying.",
      "For good or for bad, I started to forage my life journey and started stringing together a story that could explain the way things happened to me. It gave me perspective – on how things were not so bad with IITK at all.",
      "My journey was defined not by conscious choices to have a journey, but by a clash of anxieties, aspirations and pure luck. Maybe, just maybe – that’s what IITK was about – it was a continuum of strong resolve on one hand, and equally, a beautiful and plastic fragility of keeping up with a standard of excellence we used to stand for, on the other.",
      "Things started looking brighter when I came out of my unidimensional view of IITK. I took initiative and carved a niche with THC. I combined my newfound potential in ‘business problem solving’ and saw it in intersection with my creative pursuits – to eventually get placed in a product role.",
      "(Edit, a week later: This aged like milk – but we move. Still, I am in a product role – just not “placed” in it. 🥲)",
      "Even after I vacate the campus – every interaction with an alumnus founder, every call with a junior asking me for advice, every workshop invite I receive, and every friend in town calling me by “Aur bhyi, IIT!” makes me feel like I did justice to the ethos of IITK. It makes me own up everyday, come closer to this institute and be prouder and prouder of being a part of it.",
      "As we leave, and come closer to IITK every passing minute, we should realize that part of us will always roam these corridors, as it was never about finding our place in IITK – it was about letting IITK find a place in us.",

      "The 13th edition of As We Leave 2024features Parikshit Tomer, a graduating Y20 student from the department of Chemical Engineering. He covers almost everything about his experience here at IITK ranging from the online to offline shift and how he dealt with the change. Read on to have a good laugh and maybe learn some valuable life lessons at the same time.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It is said that some of all wisdom lies in JEE prep. Well, then the person who said this wouldn’t have had the gratifying experience of being at IITK because all of some wisdom garnered during JEE is flushed down the commode at the unisex bathrooms in RM as you are asked to ‘khol ke bta’ at 3 in the night.",
      "I was very confused as to how to start this AWL. So I decided to do away with the toilet humour in the beginning so that I could talk about my experiences undisturbed by the undeniable urge to talk about a top 3 list of best washrooms on campus.",
      "Before we move forward, a few things about me. I come from a household that runs a coaching institute. And so, coming to IITK wasn’t just a dream. It was part of the Tomer code of conduct. I spent a considerable time of my childhood solving sheets of Mechanics and RBD rather than talking to a lot of people. I was given unrestricted access to the internet at an age when no kid should know what 4chan was. Hence, the ‘overactive imagination’ that my English teacher claimed I had and blamed it to be the cause of my nose-diving grades.",
      "I was a part of the infamous Covid Batch,",
      "So after two online years of changing hairstyles to confuse my peers as to what my actual hairstyle was(only to get a receding hairline on campus due to this damn IITK water), we received the coveted invitation to be able to set our royal posteriors inside an IITK lecture hall rather than wear underwear to CHE211 lectures at 8 in the morning on zoom.",
      "The Online to offline shift reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, where this guy goes on a vacation to a German beach, and then people inexplicably start shooting at him for no reason at all.",
      "Yeah, that’s what it felt like.",
      "Everyone talks about how good it felt meeting friends and all that jazz, but what hit my introverted-sheltered self first upon coming to campus was the sense that I was gonna have to do my laundry. Couple that with compulsory offline attendance in early morning classes, and I was contemplating taking the first train back to Delhi by the end of the first week, and that’s something a lot of people don’t tell you about college. How difficult it is to make it past the first week without breaking down.Not just academics and projects or working on cutting-edge research but also things like eating breakfast(something I still haven’t done successfully) or doing your laundry. College is like playing FIFA against prime BARCA with you having Wrexham United,10 men down.",
      "As a part of my process of fitting into college, I tried my hand at a lot of things. The online sem saw me double time clubs like a high school jock and then end up with no 3rd year POR to speak of as a result. So, if there is one thing I WOULD like for you to take away from here, it is, by all means, explore and try your hand at new things, but,",
      "When people say f*** around and find out, make sure you get to the ‘finding out’ part and don’t become a permanent resident of the ‘f*** around’ ville. Because if you do, then the only thing you will have at the end of 4 years is a seeping trauma of all group projects and a perennial hatred for POR holders.",
      "Over time, the ‘B.Tech’ way of life began to seep in. The cliches became quirks, doing laundry became routine(or an absentee for some), and the people … became closer.",
      "Earlier, what had just been a spectre became an entity doomed to roam and haunt the same hallways as me. The strangers occupying the seats at CCD are transformed from polka dots on a sun dress to characters straight out of a Wes Anderson film.",
      "Now, I have been introverted all my life. I have also been rude and crass in places I shouldn’t have been. Before coming to campus, I thought the world was a bitter place and something best left for others to be dealt with. And I believe that everyone else thought the same of me.",
      "And so, the hive mind of smelly walking Neanderthals I found myself surrounded with seemed to be able to look past my comically large nose, this group of people who weren’t phased by my insufferable love for movies and books. Or weren’t phased by my devotion to Star Wars people who..Dare I say it? It actually tolerated me and made me rethink my zombie apocalypse plans.",
      "What was even more surprising is that despite my best efforts at imagining myself as a lonesome honey badger, I found my neural pathways concocting chemicals that resembled what I can only describe as a delightful blend of serotonin-infused confetti and dopamine-fueled fireworks, sparking joy in the most unexpected moments like a Disney parade marching through the wilderness of my mind.",
      "This was the first sign of what I can only describe as a tryst with my laundry. If anyone asks what changed me the most at IITK, the malfunctioning washing machines here would stand first.",
      "But coming to campus was just the beginning, and our nascent minds were due to a seismic shock popularly described as ‘getting a job’.",
      "I truly believe the intern and placements seasons are just as likely to spawn a radical communist as they are to create a Data Analyst. The environment of those days is something that has shown me humans at all ends of the “characters in a post-apocalyptic world” scale.",
      "Everyone from selfless protagonists trying to help everyone out to scheming marauding asses who don’t tell anyone they have been bitten until the last moment before turning into a zombie. It’s a time of colossal responsibilities heaped on our infantile shoulders.",
      "So much so that ideas of being ambitious or trying to change the world take a back seat when you are trying to get shortlisted in a mid-tier core firm. But at the same time, this has also shown me some incredible people who have dared to go against the norm and chart their way through rough seas with nothing but a broken slipper and a flip-flop to paddle with. Absolute nut jobs who try their hands at firms way out of their league or try out for endeavours deemed too risky by many. This breed of whacked-out crackheads who, despite everything, dare to take a step forward without thinking of setting up a safety net or a backup first is people who I truly admire.",
      "Although these people were hard to find, and more often than not, they weren’t in the places you would expect them to be. But unearthing one of those nutjobs on campus was a true delight and a highly recommended experience for anyone.",
      "Now I realize I have been skipping over a lot of stuff here. My time at clubs like Debsoc and ELS, or my encounter with the absolute sitcom characters that were the professors here.The experience of learning about metal electrodes from someone who had spent their entire lives dedicated to that one cylindrical object to meeting incredible people who you knew were either gonna win a Nobel prize or start their own terrorist division was …something…. to say the least. Professors are a fascinating group of men. They are people who have worked hard to get to where they are today, and their contributions to society far outweigh anything I could hope to achieve, so I believe I am no one to comment on their skill set or credibilities.",
      "Having said that,",
      "I believe there is something to be said about how accurate some of the cliches in Big Bang Theory can be. Academics at IITK is a wild ride, made more so by the sitcomesque professors on our campus. One second, you top a mass transfer quiz, and the next, you are in an HSS class discussing why our society is biased towards poodles rather than pugs.",
      "It is with this dual life of having a hive of friends and a cast of academicians juggling by my side that I sauntered to my final year of college.",
      "By then, the campus irrevocably took home in my heart. This place changed from a pilot episode to a full-blown season. The quirks became endearing, the academics became tolerable, and the hive became larger.",
      "",
      "This place, with its DIY laundry and half-cooked potatoes that had inevitably taken root in my heart(those potatoes gave me dysentery, so the heart wasn’t the only place they had taken root in), now gently but firmly was telling me to fork off.",
      "",
      "Now, as I do find my posterior being kicked with an IITK logo-shaped boot, I am condemned to look back, and as I leave, I write this, not as a summary of my CV but as a feeble attempt to make a mark on the void. I am hurling words in the darkness of the Vox webpage, hoping someone out there is reading this. To try and chip one stone in this cavernous dungeon. Leaving now makes me wonder if I achieved anything at all. I look across at the corner of my room where the folds of laundry lie washed and clean, and the pictures of my hive adorn my table, and I find myself nodding as I run my hand through the hairline I inevitably lost.",
      "",
      "This is why, when sitting in CCD in one of its wooden armrest chairs, Leaning back to the bitter-sweet smell of coffee wafting through the premises. With the comforting hum of conversation in the back, a small battalion of people waiting to order at the counter, and a teeming mass of CCD workers preparing mispronounced Croissants(K-RO-S-AN, like a Japanese curse word) and black coffees, I found myself surrounded by spectres once again. The faces that seemed familiar and yet completely new.People in the same circle of hell as me, and yet with a different prefix to their roll number as mine. I realized that at that moment, I knew no one in that room. As the coffee arrived and the CCD staff gave me a sad, knowing smile, I realized…this was my cue to leave.",

Everything in the article, from incidents to names, is directly linked to something in the real world. If you cannot figure out what a particular reference is, you aren’t thinking hard enough. And for those of you inclined towards history and literature, all of the names used are connected to either historical or literary characters. To start off, I’ll tell you that Rurik represents the Y20 Team Heads, which includes me.",
      "",
      "Read on folks.",
      "Prologue",
      "Rurik had received the crown from his people. But rather than an air of celebration, the mood at the coronation was of sobriety and mourning. The crown was once the owner of vast estates in the Heli Labs. But the present was far from glorious. All that remained was a rump state, if even that. Rurik was no king, merely the leader of dervishes. They had no home to call their own and no army worthy of conquering one. TheAerianswere in dire straits, and it was no secret. Rurik was not a newcomer to his dynasty’s problems. The present state of affairs was brought about by the Great Plague. The plague had turned many great realms to dust, and Rurik’s ancestors had done well to keep theAeriansalive. While they lacked the resources of the great empires, and recovery would be long and arduous, theAerianscounted themselves fortunate to have survived the Plague.",
      "Part 1: The dancing dervish",
      "Rurik’s famed ancestors had once led troops across the Black Chasm into Iberia, and his people clamored to repeat the feat. Rurik, however, knew that any promises of a campaign such as this could only be empty. The Aerian armies were bare, the fleets were non-existent, and morale had been sapped. His immediate goal would thus be to rebuild his broken military and claim a home for his people.",
      "Rurik attempted to build a home in Praetorium Quinque and Praetorium Duo numerous times. One of these is burned into the hearts of the Aerians for the remarkable insult it embodied.",
      "Through negotiations, Rurik had secured a small patch of barren land in Praetorium Quinque. Even in this godforsaken place, the Aerians built a semblance of a home. That was until one day, Praetorium Quinque commanded them to leave and do so within a week. The Aerians attempted to appeal, but no one truly cared for them. They were forced to gather what they could on their backs, and Praetorium Quinque set fire to the rest. It was a raw demonstration of power. The land would again be barren after Rurik was driven out, a marker of shattered dreams and broken hopes.",
      "Part 2: The taste of a hearth, Praetorium duo",
      "The Nauticans were old friends of Rurik. While the plague had battered them too, they still held their lands, unlike the dispossessedAerians. This friendship would soon prove invaluable for Rurik.",
      "He planned a campaign against theShastraand appealed to the Nauticans for help against the common foe. The Nauticans were willing to allow the Arrians into their lands for the campaign’s duration. The news was greeted with great fanfare. After years of dervishdom, would they have some place to call their own? It was not theirs in any real sense, but they were no longer nomads. The sinews of war began to tighten. Rurik drilled his troops relentlessly and built his engines of war. During this time, the Aerians built one of their most beloved siege engines. Some would call it theFerrum pedites. Otherswould name it theHomme de Ferre.TheIronfoot, as this engine will be referred to in this text, will soon meet its first test.",
      "Part 3: The Ironfoot",
      "Rurik initiated the campaign in winter. It was the first time he led men into battle, and his inexperience showed. But he had prepared his army well. The Aerians laid siege to the Shastran fortress of Gundabad. The belovedIronfootwould prove critical to the assault that would finally take this castle. Rurik was quite surprised; he had not expected this victory, which made it all the sweeter. With the fall of Gundabad, the way to the Shastran capital of Madras lay wide open. If the Aerians of today had such an opportunity, they would have laid waste to Madras, but Rurik’s time was different. While he had a functioning army, he did not have the logistical resources to attack Madras. Greater fights were coming up, and he intended to save his hosts for those.",
      "Part 4: The Tenth Technician War",
      "The great Technican Institutes were once again at war. As the vast war machines of these empires cranked into motion, smaller powers often sought to strengthen their position by participating in these conflicts in the hope of reward. Rurik and his men owed their loyalty to Kanpur according to old feudal customs, and they decided to honor the same.",
      "Rurik’s troops had gained a reputation for siege warfare and attempted to utilize this reputation to gain concessions from the Technicia Kanpuria. Praetorium Duo fell under Kanpuria jurisdiction, and after negotiations, theSanctum TechniciumwithinPraetorium Duowas granted to the Aerians for the duration of the war. We shall refer to it by the name SnT room for the rest of the text.",
      "The Drona Campaign",
      "Covering the history of the Great Drona Campaign is outside the purview of this text. To summarise, we can state that The Campaign lasted the entire winter and extended into the next spring. It was the most brutal fighting Rurik had endured and was marked by a constant lack of provisions and equipment in difficult terrain. The issues were often exacerbated by poor coordination from the high command. One incident stands out.TheDronatribe, whose lands would become the center of the fighting, had agreed to a parley with the warring parties. There would have been valuable tactical and strategic information on offer. Rurik was eager to participate in the conference. However, the high command completelyforgotto inform Rurik of the location and time. To add to the travesty, none of the high command attended the conference. Incidents like these would be sadly common for many who served Technicia Kanpuria. While Rurik did not have expectations of any useful aid from the central command, the apparent sabotage of his efforts was utterly exasperating.",
      "After months of grueling effort, the culmination of this campaign would come at the Battle of Empiar in  March 2023. There are sparse records of this battle, but we do have some Aerian memoirs to go by. Rurik arrayed his forces against the enemy in the early morning, but battle only commenced in the afternoon. Rurik saw Kanpuria banners rising over his left flank as the fighting raged. Before he could react, the men bearing these banners charged, but not against his enemy. They crashed heavily into Rurik’s left flank, ripping it asunder. Though shaken by the treason, Rurik had maintained enough control over his army to withdraw in good order. While Rurik would later reform his troops and launch a devastating night assault to claim a hard-won victory, this treason would deeply scar the Aerians.",
      "Eventually, peace would be signed in the Tenth Technican War. Technicia Kanpuria had sustained some serious setbacks in the war. The Eleventh Technican War would bring complete and utter disaster to the Kanpurians. However, that was in the future. The results of the Tenth War had already begun to spark unrest.",
      "The Politikia",
      "We shall not cover the civil unrest that erupted in the wake of the Tenth Technican War in this text. It is a long story, and for brevity’s sake, we must move on. To summarise, Kanpurian setbacks in the war became a key theme in the struggle for power that followed. Rurik distanced himself from political struggle. Greatly disillusioned and with scars of the Technican War still burning bright in his memory, he refused to attach his name to the Grand Council of Kanpuria.",
      "The Implications of the Drona Campaign for Rurik",
      "The Shastran Campaign, followed by the Drona Campaign, had proven the Aerian mettle. The Sanctum Technicium was firmly under Rurik’s grip by now. While there would be some attempts to usurp it by the Techno-governor of Praetorium Duo, they would be thwarted. The Techno-governor had attempted to seize the holdings of both the Aerians and the Nauticans. However, he was forced to retreat. He would eventually exile himself for many months, which ended the brewing unrest.",
      "The continued conflicts had provided Rurik with a clear heir. Rurik had no children of his own. However, over the long years of war, a talented young commander, Oleg, had risen through the ranks. And thus it was that on a solemn morning in April of 2023, Rurik abdicated from his position as the king of the Aerians. Then he crowned Oleg and gave him the following words as a parting gift:",
      "While the Gods did not see it fit for me to bear a son, you are no less than a son to me. I have seen Odin’s strength in your eyes. I see in you the flame that will cut a swath across this land and bring vast glory and prosperity to our nation. I pray that you may never falter, and yet if you feel your heart shiver, know that I stand with you until the moment I draw breath.",
      "A portrait of Rurik and Oleg",
      "Some parting words",
      "Today, Oleg’s reign has run its course. It has been illustrious, and he has far surpassed the achievements of his father, Rurik. Oleg himself had this to say about his reign:",
      "You know the poem “The Road Not Taken”? There are two roads, and I am walking on the damned grass.",
      "Oleg, much like his father, did not have any sons, or at least any that were worthy of being the king of the Aerians. Eventually,Yaroslavascended to the Aerian throne.",
      "In the meantime, Rurik had grown older. Yet he had watched the fortunes of theAeriansrise. He reflected on the times of his youth when they were but wandering dervishes. As he lay on his deathbed, soon to become little more than a memory, he smiled. He had seen Yaroslav, a man whose prowess was far beyond Oleg, and Oleg himself had proven stronger and wiser than he had. From the ashes of the Great Plague, the phoenix had risen, and it had not yet stopped its ascent. Rurik closed his eyes for the last time and saw the gates of Valhalla open before him. His time had come, and he would pass to Odin with a heart full of joy.",

      "In the 7th edition of AWL 2024, Hisham Hadi T, a Y20 graduate from the Electrical Engineering Department, takes readers on an enthralling adventure that not only tests his courage but also evolves his friendships.",
      "Disclaimer: The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author’s experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Vox asked me to submit this AWL by the 20thof April. So here I am – on the 21st– starting to write it. That’s one thing that hasn’t changed at all in the four years of my stay here. Like Benjamin Franklin said, “Do not do today what you can do on deadline day”.",
      "Of course, the biggest writing block was deciding what to write about. I foraged through my IITK memories to find the best thing to share as I graduate, but I wasn’t satisfied with anything I found. And then I realized, my most memorable IITK story happened a couple hundred miles away from IITK.",
      "It was my fifth semester, and mid sem recess was coming up. The internship drive had tag teamed with acads to wrestle us, and we all were dying for an excuse to relax. One late night, sitting in front of a closed CCD, we drew up a detailed itinerary for a Jaipur trip and then decided to go to Mussoorie.",
      "There were eight of us: me, Anand, Melvin, Adheena, Sahil, Drishty, Divya and Rahber. We set out on the 30thof September on a train to the mountains. The josh was high by the time we reached Mussoorie. We had spent the previous day rafting in Rishikesh, and once you’ve been in the turbulent waters of the Ganga being pushed around by waves and friends alike on the first day, you’re yearning for that sort of adventure throughout the trip.",
      "The Gang(Rishikesh)",
      "The rooms we had booked, although away from the town, were within walking distance from Kempty Falls. In other words, Kempty Falls was our personal ice-cold swimming pool. It’s not your typical high-rise waterfall; it’s a series of small terraced falls. Waterfalls on one level, forms a full-sized pool of water, and then falls to the next level below. The lowest level is the most popular, as it’s the first pool people see as they ascend the hill. The further up you go, the less explored the falls and pools get.",
      "In Kempty Falls (Rahber, Divya and Melvin)",
      "And you are college students with a fetish for adventure running in your veins in place of blood. You won’t settle for the half package; what is doable, you’ll do it. What just might be doable, you’ll try that too. It’s something about that age. And that’s why five of us kept climbing up the hill, level after level, until eventually reaching the highest accessible point, a calm pool of chilly water formed by a wide fall of about two feet in height. We were having fun.",
      "For the most part, the pool was shallow. The water level would settle a little below your waist, deep enough to swim but shallow enough to get out of the water if you feel too cold. But if you get close to the fall, the ground takes a sharp change in slope, and it soon gets as deep as a man and a half. In our group, I was the best swimmer, while Melvin and Divya could swim reasonably. Adheena and Rahber, on the other hand, were foreign to the art. So, while they stayed in the shallow area, the swimmers were making frequent trips to the deep part.",
      "Right about where the fall was, there was a rock rising out of the water. Soon, we were climbing onto it and jumping or diving into the deep water. Anyone who swims knows that diving is the best part. And the sensation of penetrating freezing water, the feeling of the coldness enveloping you head to feet, was adding to the thrill. While Divya, Melvin and I took turns on the rock, something else was bubbling up in Rahber – FOMO.",
      "He wanted to try. Getting on the rock wasn’t an issue, as it could be approached from the other side, where the water was shallow. The complicated part would come after the jump, getting back from the deep zone. We thought about it, and it seemed doable. He could make the jump, and I could drag him to the shallows once he did. We had two backup swimmers as well. What could possibly go wrong?",
      "There were two things. We found out the hard way.",
      "Rahber was soon standing on the edge of the rock, but he couldn’t get himself to jump just yet. Anyone who has been in that position knows the difficulty of finding the courage to jump into water you know is deeper than you. Melvin followed him to the rock to talk some motivation into him while I waited at the edge of the shallows, giving my own words of encouragement. A couple more minutes of stalemate, and then it happens. Rahber makes the jump. I immediately knew things had gone wrong.",
      "The thing that could go wrong, number one, a  communication gap. Rahber was not a diver; he jumped his feet first. That wasn’t a surprise, though. I was expecting him to jump in my direction so that he would cover some distance, and I would carry him the rest of the way. But I hadn’t explicitly told him this; I was kind of taking it for granted. Instead, he jumped towards the fall side, quite near the rock itself, and was already struggling to keep his head above the water, flipping about frantically and gasping for air. I needed to hurry.",
      "I swam quickly in his direction, but there was no way I could get hold of him without him calming down first. His arms were being flung in every direction as if to catch a ball of air that was evading him, and his legs were kicking strongly into the water, albeit futilely. I realized that what he needed first was not saving; it was breath. As I reached him, I dived underwater myself and planted my feet on the ground. Then I caught hold of his waist and lifted him up like Simba by the monkey in The Lion King.",
      "A few seconds like that. Rahber savors his first pure gulp of air since jumping in. The restless arms and legs relax, and the panic starts to subside. But all is not well yet. As he is regaining his composure, under the water I am losing my breath. This can’t go on indefinitely; I must come back to the surface. The plan is simple: once Rahber has calmed down, he should take one deep breath and be ready to go underwater again. I will let him go and get some air myself and then bring him up and swim him to the shore. Except there’s one problem. It’s not like he has prior experience being saved from drowning, and there’s no way I can communicate this to him from under the water. But there’s no time to come up with a better plan; I am almost out of breath and need to resurface. I let go of his waist.",
      "The thing that could go wrong, number two, the panic. Understandably, the drowning man is not a very rational being. All that matters to the drowning man is staying alive, and if I may use a DSA term you all are familiar with, he will use only a greedy algorithm to do it. You can’t ask a drowning man to take a step back so that he leaps forward, and you can’t blame him for that.",
      "Imagine the feeling of the ground beneath your feet suddenly disappearing, you suddenly finding yourself in quicksand. That must be how Rahber felt when I let go of him, and the panic was back faster than the flash. He didn’t know I was just taking a breath, and from his point of view, he was back in the nightmare of drowning. And in that situation, he does the only thing he can do – use me as leverage.",
      "In the panic of the moment, he pushes down on me to stay above water. And I don’t have the breath left to be able to afford that. The roles have reversed now, and I am the one drowning. Underwater, I am fighting his hard grip to make him let go, but he’s holding on for dear life, kicking the water desperately. This could have been the end.",
      "Thankfully, the friends waiting in the shallows realized that I had been underwater too long. Without losing a beat, Melvin jumped in from the rock and took hold of Rahber, making him relax his grip just enough for me to break free and resurface and launch myself to the edge of the shallows where Adheena and Divya were standing. There, neck deep in water but feet finally on solid ground, I hit my lowest point mentally.",
      "The pungent reality of the possibility that one of us – the saver or the savee – might not make it out of this hit me like a tsunami. I could see Melvin fighting the same battles I fought a couple of minutes ago, and I knew that, just like me, he couldn’t keep it up forever, either. While not proficient enough in swimming to carry Rahber on his own, being an athlete meant that Melvin had a better lung capacity than me. Still, it’s not a limitless resource. Something had to be done fast.",
      "I was still recovering from the shock of being the drowning man myself; all those times my parents told me to be careful of the water flashed in my mind. They would say it every time I went on a trip, and I would casually assure them that I would. But at that moment, my head was above water, and the world was sinking. Air was all around me, and yet it felt suffocating. But inaction wasn’t an option for any of us.",
      "No words were spoken. No plans were discussed. We just knew that none of us was going to fix this alone. I could try swimming to Rahber and taking Melvin’s place, but both me and Adheena knew it wouldn’t achieve much. We needed all of us to pull this off.",
      "Me and Divya started moving towards Rahber. Behind me, Adheena placed her feet firmly on the edge of the shallows and held out her hand to me. I took it and in turn, extended my other hand to Rahber as far as I could. But I still wasn’t close enough. From behind Rahber, Melvin gave him one strong push, and Divya, who had approached swimming from the side, caught hold of the collar of his shirt and gave it a firm pull, bringing him just close enough to me for him to extend his arm and connect with me. The shirt tore a little with the force of the pull, but it had done the trick. Rahber, who was now more composed as the initial shock of drowning had receded, extended his arm to me, and as soon as I connected, Adheena took her cue and pulled strongly. Melvin and Divya did their part too, pushing us from the other side, and all five of us huddled towards the shallows.",
      "Everyone is Safe (At a lower pool. Melvin lightens the mood, as Rahber walks with his now torn shirt and I sit processing what just happened)",
      "Sunshine. Air. Relief.",
      "The moment was serene; everyone was safe, and we knew that everyone was safe. The comfort of that knowledge is indescribable. The ice-cold water around us wasn’t bothering us. We were talking about what had just happened, sharing the scariest parts for each of us, expressing what went through each of our minds at various points, and even laughing about it for a couple of minutes.",
      "You might ask how we could laugh about something like this. But you see, there is something about almost dying that makes you appreciate life so much more.",

      "Readers are highly encouraged to play the “audiobook” as they read because:",
      "It is 5:15 AM on May 6th, 2024, and as I see the sky lighten and grow yellow-gold, and my friends in various stages of sleep being bumped around by the hastily-booked Vikram auto that is taking us to Bithoor for my first visit in 2.5 years of living in Kanpur, I start to write the intro to this AWL in my head.",
      "And then I decide it is too complicated.",
      "Hi! For any stranger who has somehow arrived here, I’m Janhvi. Or Jahnvi, depending on your persuasion. I’m a recently graduated Computer Science and Engineering student from this obscure li’l place called IITK. You may have seen me roaming around with my hall 2 boys (Aditya, Akhil, Soham), grabbing candies from any nearby canteen, or always sitting alone in the H6 mess. Or you may have seen me running around for some Gender Cell work, at a Book Club event, or sitting in the senate hall alternately trying to talk sense and enjoying the ✨drama✨.",
      "Aditya ke teen dost (Soham, me & Akhil)",
      "Or you may have never seen me. After all, this campus is big enough for the both of us. And if I am to talk about the time I’ve spent here, I will have to talk about who I was before. So bear with me.",
      "PFA my bio-data: funny lil fat kid, good at academics, bold and loud and sometimes mean. And then I “chose” JEE because my options were that or NEET, and I didn’t want to repeat what my sister had done. I spent almost two years of my life studying daily at my coaching for 12 hours straight (do not call me a Maggu™), and then six months of lockdown exclusively reading questionable fanfiction off of questionable websites. This included not touching a single textbook or quiz or talking to a single teacher or peer from the coaching or elsewhere.",
      "It was quiet, it was lonely, and like many other people, I was incredibly lost. Instead of going back to my “shell”, I kind of barrelled straight into a cell and chose to not even peep out.",
      "Dark, dark times. Dark like a gulab jamun",
      "Thank all the gods for C*vid ending. And thank God for IITK.Our first semester was such a confusing experience. I’d been on the internet for years at that point, but only to watch or read or listen and never to interact with a real new person, a real stranger. Youtubers or authors or musicians didn’t prepare me for the alarm I felt when I saw Girik Maskara’s innocent text asking me if I wanted to be added to the department group. (I ended up going to my first college trip with him and some other friends). Oh well, you live and learn.",
      "On 18th November 2020, I attended my first “class”. On the 25th, I joined Prayas which remained with me throughout college. On the 29th, I started talking to the person who soon became my absolute best friend. These people became more real to me than most people around, and it was mind blowing that we had never even met properly.",
      "Aditya (the best friend)(our first time outside campus, and one of our last events in campus)",
      "It was not all hunky-dory though. My weird style of not texting back for days at a time was naturally not to everyone’s tastes. I found people (like Akanksha) who I instantly connected with but we just couldn’t deal with each other online. I found her again slowly, very slowly, after coming to campus. On the other side, I lost friendships that worked beautifully online but we were just too different in the real world.",
      "I met Shivangi when she had a boy cut and was dressed up as Percy Jackson. I met Raaghav because of an embarrassing misunderstanding where I may have come across as an anti-vaxxer.",
      "Raaghav, who can now certify I’m not a facebook-level boomer",
      "The point of all of this is to tell you how bizarre it was. But also to say I’m so grateful for these people. Because while we were making friends, we were also dealing with online classes, online labs, online discussions where no one speaks and we all just stare at the TA, or worse, one dumbass classmate keeps talking and talking and you can’t lamp him on the head for it because you promised to be a nonviolent person and also because, you know, you live hundreds of miles away. A touch-starved, emotionally starved, pent up generation of children trying to breathe fresh air in the same four-walled rooms.",
      "But like I said, thank God for IITK.",
      "Because campus was the freshest breath of air I’d ever taken, the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen, the most free I (and most of us) have ever been.",
      "Learning to ride a cycle with no hands. Do not repeat this stunt at home",
      "I realise that most of this is about the journey to IITK and not in IITK, but I cannot sit here and summarise in a few hundred words how important the last two and a half years have been. You grow in this place more than anywhere else, you learn how to be a person, have a thought process, and have principles of your own. You learn how stupid you are (I will not even exemplify this because I was so embarrassingly stupid) and how smart you can be (I got an A in Suchitra ma’am’s course). You learn how to juggle academics with your interests and your relationships and your responsibilities. You learn how it feels to break down under immense pressure (6th sem, f*cking Compilers) and then whom to approach who will tell you to get your shit together (thank you, Jiya) and, again, breathe, babygirl.",

      "You can never see it coming because it’ll always find ways to surprise you. I’m a Book Club person, so I’ll tell you a story: once upon a time, this girl was having a really really terrible semester. Meanwhile, her 21st birthday was coming up. She develops a fear that the days before the birthday will remain really depressing, the day of the birthday will be a false hope of seemingly incoming happiness, of having only one good day. And that the days after the birthday will go back to their usual depressing programming.Dear reader, the good day never came. It was all continuously crap.",
      "Solution? Find people like Shivangi, who will stick by you in every sad funk",
      "Not to say that IITK doesn’t surprise you pleasantly. I have met the most wonderful people through the Book Club and had the nerdiest possible discussions with them. Through Gender Cell, I have sometimes met people having the crappiest time of their life, but they have all been so resilient, so very brave. And if you look beyond us loud undergrads, you will find brilliant PhD folks, who are, at the end of the day, just like us. You will find incredibly sweet and hardworking SIS guard didis and bhaiyas, or the didi who cleans your room, or the bhaiya who works in your mess. If you talk to them, you will realise that our campus is an entire system, separate from the city but existing in the same unequal world. There are charms in IITK you can find nowhere else, true, but our system sometimes fails some of our residents spectacularly.",
      "While it may not be your duty as a student, it is only by engaging with more than just academics or PoRs that we can be part of the community of this vivid place.",
      "L to R: Karan, Akanksha, me, Prof Suchitra Mathur, Shreya, Priya",
      "The campus is chock-full of interesting, funny and kind people. There are almost 10000 of us students in 1024 acres, and trust me, if you haven’t met your kind yet, keep looking. Trust that our campus does not disappoint. I met someone at the end of 5th semester and they are so cool and they like me and it’s awesome. I met someone I’d known since the 4th semester, but only started talking to them in the 8th and they are so cool and they like me and it’s awesome. I met several someones in the last 3 days as I write this and they are so cool and they seem to like me and it’s goddamn awesome. And it is so unfair that we have to leave.",

I won’t be able to be part of the community that welcomes them here, to their new home. So to any juniors or anyone on campus reading this, please enjoy yourselves. For all our sakes.",
      "Siddhant, Srishti, Avni, Jahnvi Jr., Abhinav: some of my favourite bacche",

      "I am Vedant Gitte, a final year undergrad student of Batti. I am extremely hyperactive and you would definitely see me a lot around campus and at events. I spend the majority of the day outside my room either roaming the campus or meeting my friends. I was a CTM at Counselling Service in my third year. Where I can say I gave in all my efforts and dedication. The story just revolves around how being CTM has affected me, and how the experience has helped me through other challenges in college.",
      "I really won’t be writing much about my first year. It was the same as any other fresher in college: exploring interests, connecting with new people, and taking part in various activities.",
      "Still from Train when we were coming to college for the first time.",
      "As for the Second year, we came to campus in our 4th Semester (the first three sems were online due to the Pandemic). It was wonderful to meet people in person. I joined Volleyball then and used to spend 2 hrs on the ground daily.  That time was great as I felt good physically and mentally. I was also part of the Election Commission, Outreach, and Academic and Career Council. I met some nice people there. This was the time the core team member form of the Counselling Service came out.",
      "Meeting new people at IITK",
      "Through the second year, I had seen the work of Counselling Service as a Student Guide. During the first few days on campus, I saw the CTMs helping with hall allocation and other events. It exhilarated me to be part of such an organization.",
      "When the CTM form came out, I remember the discussion/talks going on l about who would be filling the forms and who had chances. Trust me, at that time at least, I didn’t come in among the most likely candidates in my Hall.",
      "When the forms came out, I remember spending the entire day and night preparing for the role. There were not many situations I had handled, nor did I have a strong personality at the time. Some people were even rude and said things like why was I even bothering to apply if there were better people in the Hall? Every small to big action I took during that time was taken considering what an ideal CTM might do. I picked up littered trash and put it in the dustbin whenever possible. I made sure to be polite to everyone, I protected someone if he/she was targeted, and I undertook responsibilities and saw them through. I proudly say even after not being a CTM for one year now, I still take every decision considering how an ideal CTM might be.",
      "Fortunately, luck was in my favor, and I did manage to be a CTM before the end of the Second year.",
      "In the third year, I had cut down my involvement to CS only. There’s a thing about CS, no matter how much time you think CS will take, CS takes a lot more. On one side, you are planning events, the flagship Orientation, and other events, and on the other side, you are dealing with problems people come to you with. There are students in Academic Probation and Warning you have to keep in constant touch with, see to it if they have any issues academically and how you can help them. You have to be emotionally involved, or else you won’t be able to give your 100%. There are situations to deal with which your juniors, your batchmates, and sometimes seniors too; come to you with. And as a CTM, you have to dedicate yourself completely to the situation.",
      "The Fresher Orientation was due in November, and our team dedicated huge efforts to it. We planned a long 10 day Orientation in which we also had our classes, quizzes, assignments, and the intern company tests going on. Understand it was the first full-fledged orientation after 2-3 years of online semesters. It was a huge success. Y22 batch students come up even now and mention how they loved Orientation 22.",
      "Auditorium, Orientation of Y22 Batch",
      "There will be people who come and tell you to take up Positions of Responsibility in college just for the sake of your resume and career perspective. There will always be people in the same positions as you who always prioritize their personal stuff and don’t do half the duties you do.",
      "It should not hinder you even a bit from the efforts you are putting in. The confidence gained and the personality you develop outweigh all the fragile excuses and spineless, unasked advice.",
      "With Yashvardhan, Orientation of Y22 Batch",
      "Now that Orientation was over, I became more aware of my situation academically and careerwise. I had messed up my acads a bit in the 4th and 5th semesters due to my involvements. I had spent the majority of the time of 2nd-year summer for CS and for extra courses I took, so I couldn’t prepare as it is required for the Intern Season. It was just that I had miscalculated the time commitments.",
      "I must tell you, after the orientation, I became too strong-headed. Positions, irrespective of which club, change you if you give yourself completely to them. From December, I started investing a lot of time preparing for tests, talking to seniors, reading articles, and what not. I buckled up for Intern Season Phase II. For my readers in the first year, Intern Season Phase I starts in August (5th sem), and the second season starts in late January (6th sem).",
      "I cut out the leisure time. I replaced Instagram with LinkedIn, leisure time with preparation time; in short got back into the JEE mode. Intern Phase II was a disaster in our time; an unimaginably small number of companies came. Irrespective, I put in effort and managed to get an off-campus remote internship at the end of February. I joined the internship along with the ongoing semester.  Since the summer internship was still pending, I continued with my efforts and managed to get off campus summer intern on May 3rd 🙂",
      "Here, I would like to say that people give up easily if things don’t go according to what they planned. As quoted in Faults in Our Stars, “The world isn’t a wish granting factory.” Whatever situation you are in, always choose to keep on fighting. Trying and failing is always better than not trying at all.",
      "Preparing for interviews",
      "Learning from past mistakes, I spent the summer judiciously studying for Placements whenever I got time. My summer intern was also remote. I specified time within the day for sports, books, office work and placement studies.Now looking back, it was a great time, as I learned to manage a lot of things.When I got back on campus, the relentless studies, company tests, and academics continued. I had Prem Milind Gujrathi, Utkarsh Kandi, and Naman Jain as my closest friends. We spend a lot of time together preparing and helping each other through the placement season.Though the Placement situation was not good this year, all four of us managed to get placed, and it was worth all the efforts we had put in.",

      "In my third year, I managed to do what I loved. I did it with utter dedication and I did it irrespective of any hurdles. I thought nothing would surpass my 3rd year.  How wrong could I be proved? Now that I had a few months left, I decided to build habits that will help me in the long run.",
      "I have been reading a lot of self-help and fiction books. I take out 1-2 hours daily to work out. I am experimenting to be more disciplined and happier through a directed effort to grow emotionally, spiritually, and physically. I listen to good music, dance, and spend quality time with my friends here as I’m not sure when I will meet them next.",
      "I continue being part of college activities; it fills me with the energy to do good and rekindles my enthusiasm. I go for walks to keep myself in sync with nature and give myself time to think clearly. For 4 months now, I have reduced junk food intake and have practiced meditation as well. I am the person my first year me would admire.",

I can surely say I have always chosen to do the right thing and never hurt anyone intentionally. You must learn to respect others to get respect for yourself.",

      "Within a day of joining IITK as a BT CHE admit in 2015, I was provided with a well-structured answer to this question – codenamed‘kholna’– which defined me in terms of my name, some immediate identifiers (IITK-related and hometown) and fake hobbies that need to be easy to pronounce in chaste Hindi. That’s a start, but these past nine years of my association with IITK can be best described as an ongoing journey to find an answer to this question. (If you are a part of this journey, chances are you’ll find a passing reference, and if I have missed you (definitely a few!) please accept my apologies!)",
      "Diwali celebration in Hall 2 with wingmates",
      "The first few days were challenging with several firsts – hostel life (Hall 2 culture didn’t help!), living away from home, meeting people from all over India, being stereotyped, and a general imposter syndrome. A few good scores helped with the last issue, but it took me a long time to acclimate that maybe IITians are not the glorified role models I thought they were. In about a semester, I settled in, got a grip on academics, found some friends and helpful seniors, and started warming up to try out co-curricular activities. I accompanied some friends to a Vox Populi meeting in my second semester and haven’t left since! I switched to EE in my second year – deciding on a part of my professional identity for life.",
      "Me with my “bachche”",
      "I became a “baap”, i.e., Student Guide to six first-year “bachche” and an Academic Mentor. Vox stayed a constant. I also got actively involved in all major fests in different positions and a couple more random involvements. I even proposed to someone I was hanging out with – a tremendous leap for a boys’ school nerd – but got turned down (we stay good friends, and she’s the first female friend I ever made – so I am extremely grateful). To fill the void, I got into pop culture big time – binge-watching Friends, iMDb top-rated movies, listening to Pink Floyd and the like, and memes – and my co-curricular involvements fuelled my social media addiction. Pretty much everyoneknewme – offline and especially online. I was selected for the CS UG Core Team (Academics). It was dizzying – I was burning out big time. I did not like EE, and I opted for a double major and summer project in Chemistry out of interest.",
      "Core Team (Academics), Counselling Service, 2017-18",
      "EE was an extremely competitive department for me – it took a lot more effort to maintain my grades along with co-curriculars. I couldn’t do it all and needed to restrict myself to two activities I enjoyed the most – CS and Vox. I finally found the right set of friends – slowly dissociating from my wing (barring a few), which had grown somewhat toxic. I was slowly but surely getting drawn more to EE, particularly communications. I had corporate and academic intern offers (Texas Instruments and NYU, respectively) in EE and opted for the latter. I eventually decided to drop my Double Major in Chemistry and take up a Dual Degree in EE instead. To end the year on a high note, I became one of the Chief Editors of Vox!",
      "This year, I had fewer things on my plate but they required considerably higher efforts. Along with co-Chief Harshit Bhalla, I was guiding Vox through a tricky phase of sustaining and motivating a small team as well as creating an impact significant enough to ruffle many feathers and take Vox to a position of credibility where it started to be viewed as a serious “voice” of the student community. At the same time, I did well in challenging departmental courses and UGP and landed a summer internship at UCSD. I faced severe burnout again towards the end, but I felt I had finally consolidated my identity.",
      "Core Group, Vox Populi 2018-19",
      "I was mentally all over the place in the summer – clueless and burnt out. I learned a few things early in my internship, but everything fizzled out. Back in IITK for my Master’s, I procrastinated – engaging in many co-curricular activities again but nothing wholeheartedly. Many friends had left after a 4-year B.Tech., so I made several new friends who, to date, form my closest circle. An off-campus job offer gave me an excuse to sit out of placements. A timely reprimand from my thesis supervisor brought me to my senses; thereafter, it was relatively smooth sailing. I ended up acclimatising well to research life. Towards the end, I eventually took my advisors’ suggestion and opted for the IITK-NYU dual degree PhD program. Shortly after, COVID hit, and I had to finish my thesis work and graduate online – at which point I felt great that I’d have another IITK convocation as a PhD student!",

      "My PhD started in 2020 with an online semester of IITK doing PhD coursework. I finished all four courses in one semester, which was pretty hectic, along with finishing up paper submissions for my Master’s thesis work and convocation formalities for my dual degree. I secured a timely US visa, and for two years (2021-2022), I was at NYU. During this time, I finished PhD coursework at NYU, took doctoral degree-related examinations at IITK and NYU, pursued my first industry summer internship, and started my PhD dissertation work.",
      "Panwar group + IITK alumni at NYU Tandon School of Engineering",
      "I returned to IITK as a PhD student in January 2023. Life seemed a lot slower here now, and I realised soon that I didn’t have any friends here anymore. Luckily, I found some IITK UG juniors who were still around and joined their social group (hello, Gang B!), along with some batchmates and seniors. I slowly returned to some IITK activities  – election officer in Hall 8, a Senate position, departmental activities, and rejoining Vox!",
      "Some IITK bucket list items got ticked off – drunk nights in fests, visits to Ramaiya Dhaba, crashing alumni reunions, etc. I even took a leap of faith and started my first relationship. It lasted a few months, and then I realised some things weren’t working out, but I was not ready for the intense void. Work, conference travel, and therapy kept me sane. I thought I wouldn’t date again till I was back in NYC, but I couldn’t resist this wonderful human who fell for me! Almost six months in, we are still together, and hopefully for life.",
      "My NYU supervisor, Prof Shivendra Panwar, met my IITK supervisor, Dr Rohit Budhiraja, and the WiSDOm lab while visiting IITK for his alumni reunion",
      "Meanwhile, research has been going on, and it is finally taking proper shape. It looks like there’s an end in sight. My research journey hasn’t been linear in my PhD, and I allowed myself to take perhaps a detour too many. PhD is hard and tests your resilience and discipline a lot more than raw academic abilities. I’m glad I got an immersive experience of the academic cultures of India and the US. I will write more later on this, perhaps on personal blogs, once I graduate.",
      "IITK has given me everything I needed at the right time to forge my identity. I have done my fair share for IITK at various levels to make it a better and more humane place. I’m happy to be moving on from here and look forward to contributing to IITK in whatever capacity. I have lived a full life here, taking all my chances and exploring myself professionally and personally with no regrets. As I write my story after all these years, amidst all the chaos, I can observe a clear linear trajectory of growth – personal and professional – and in perspective, it all makes sense. I guess that’s how life should be! I’ll end this long monologue with two lines from an old Hindi song which I’ve been replaying in my mind for the past weeks –",

      "Note: This article is an Opinion piece by Sweta, Pool Captain, Shauryas (Takneek 22-23)",
      "Takneek, the inter-pool science and technology championship, is conducted annually by the Science and Technology (SnT) Council, IIT Kanpur. The students are divided into 5 pools, namely Aryans, Kshatriyas, Nawabs, Peshwas, and Shauryas. This division is done based on the halls of residence.",
      "For example, the pool-wise hall division for Takneek 22-23 was as follows:",
      "Pool Shauryas is the pool of all female students. Shauryas has ranked last in all editions of Takneek conducted so far. This opinion piece is an analysis of the potential reasons behind this.",
      "It is interesting to note here how the official term used is ‘pool’ while the majority refers to it in daily conversations as ‘hall’.  This can be seen vividly through the hall t-shirts of the UG halls, which have the pool names and symbols on them, and hence the understanding developed here is from the perspective of halls: four male halls and one female hall.",
      "There are various issues associated with the participation of the pool of females in Takneek. The resource and budget constraints, representation in the Science and Technology Council, and lack of guidance have been analysed here.",
      "There are various hardware-based events and problem statements. The SnT Council allocates a budget of approximately  INR 6000 for the same. Any additional funds needed were to be arranged by the pools themselves. Takneek has been a UG-centric activity, and hence, the PG halls do not invest in it. This becomes important for the case of the female pool, because the first-year UG students now reside in a primarily PG hall. This change happened Y22 batch onwards due to the space crunch on campus.",
      "As mentioned above, the pool of females (now Shauryas, formerly known as Veeras) was formed very recently. Moreover, the position of the Science and Technology Secretary in the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) was introduced in the tenure 2022-23 for the first time. They lacked not just funds and hardware but also the logistical know-how of the functioning of Takneek.",
      "An incident in particular which reflects upon this is from Takneek 22-23.  The participation of 1st/2nd/3rd-year UGs is made compulsory for Takneek (as it is an exploratory and learning event for freshers). From the Y22 batch onwards, first-year female undergraduate students reside in Hall 4. With no historical logistical setup as such, there was a major confusion between Halls 6 and 4 on who should fund Takneek. While the other halls have been funding Takneek for many years, despite the freshers residing in Hall 13, this was a new situation for the female pool. Due to the misunderstanding between the two halls, participation from Hall 4 was hindered. This confusion led to the first-year students, who are residents of Hall 4, not being able to participate for 2-3 days, which is a huge setback for any type of problem statement.",
      "Secondly, as the history of Takneek gives the male pools a stronger ground to stand on since they had the majority of these hardware materials within their reach, the halls were also willing to invest significantly greater amounts of their budgets for the sake of culture, one which is yet to develop for the pool of females.This creates a division in the quality of submissions made. As evidence of the above-stated factor, here is a recommendation from the Post Conduction Report of Takneek 23-24 – “Many concerns were raised regarding the conduction of the hardware PS’s in Takneek, we would recommend that either the construction of hardwares of all the pools shall be enforced to be made very similar by the guidelines of the PS, if there is a scope of creativity of distinctiveness in construction of hardware, each and every case of submission should be very carefully thought of and very descriptive PS should be designed.”",
      "The undergraduate students are distributed between various halls on a gender and graduation year basis. The pools are divided such that each pool has an equal distribution of students from all years. Approximately 1000 undergraduate students are there in each pool. However, in reality, not all members of a pool participate in such events.",
      "The effective participation in Takneek comes from students who a) are currently associated with the SnT council, b) were previously associated with it, and c) want to explore the council/plan to be associated with it. These students are the following:",
      "*They are usually the ones who make the problem statements and are not allowed to participate but make up an essential part of the analysis.",
      "Here is an assessment of the number of people involved in the SnT council per pool during each year’s Takneek:",
      "A.) Takneek 22-23 : In this edition of Takneek, only a few entities had their problem statements, and only those are considered for the analysis.",
      "B.)Takneek 23-24: For this edition, the problem statements for each category were selected from a random draw from a fixed set of problem statements submitted by all entities, and hence the entire council is considered.",
      "*For this analysis, the total number of males vs females for each category was analysed. The total number of males was then divided by 4, to take into account the average number of people in the SnT council from a male pool. (Data source: SnT  Council ratification lists)",
      "Note: These numbers since the Y20 batch are the maximum that has been seen yet. This is also partly because of the jump in the intake of female students.",
      "While the guidance available to the junior batches in a pool cannot be quantified, the importance and relevance of it is mutually agreed upon by all the participating pools. This is so because the problem statements are specific to the domains covered by respective entities within the council. Therefore, with more domain-specific guidance, the solutions proposed improve qualitatively. Moreover, the number of pool members associated with major entities (some entities have more problem statements or higher weightage) has a direct proportionality with the quality of submissions and the points secured.",
      "The lack of seniors available for guidance (majorly Y19s and Y20s) for pool Shauryas was a major factor contributing to their position in the competition. When compared against the guidance given by experienced seniors to the other pools, this shows the lack clearly. Moreover, it is a commonly held ideology that ‘girls lack the motivation for Takneek’. This can be questioned when the number of submissions made are assessed. Pool Shauryas had almost the same number of submissions as the male pools. The fact that the pool still secured the last position supports the argument that it was because of the poor quality and not a lack of motivation.",
      "These factors, guidance, representation, and resource constraints, contribute greatly to determining where females will land in such events. For this reason, such a result not only reinforces sexist stereotypes but also hits hard the self-esteem of first-year undergraduate women. However, it is important to note that we are not dealing with a mere problem-solving situation here; rather, what is needed is a more profound comprehension of the present context. By refraining from proposing solutions immediately we give ourselves time to fully understand all details involved. The understanding acts as our first major step towards righting the wrongs caused by years of this kind of imbalance.",
      "It is important that we acknowledge and recognize the hard work put in by many undergraduate female students. They should receive equal amounts of attention as male students who have achieved dissimilar levels of success. To my dear colleagues who have worked tirelessly for hours on end, your input counts just as much as anyone else’s does.",

      "Note: This article is an Editorial by Vox Populi,IIT Kanpur",
      "Following a contention raised in the Students’ Senate against our article “A Review of the 55th Inter IIT Sports Meet,” published on 3rd October 2023, a review committee was formed to deliberate upon the matter.Vox was directed by the Review Board to take down the investigative piece, citing multiple violations of the “Journalism Ethics and Standards document” in the article.",
      "We stand by our work and do not agree with the findings of the Review Board.We argue that the investigation by the Review Board was procedurally flawed and incomplete, a stance we elaborate on in the following Slides.",
      "However, as a body under the Gymkhana mandate, we have redacted the article from all formal channels until further deliberation.",
      "On the 8th of November, a contention was presented on the senate floor by the Ex-GenSec, Games & Sports (2022-23), claiming the article violated several clauses in the “Journalism Ethics and Standards document.”",
      "In response to the contention, a five-member Review Committee was formed consisting of the President, Chairperson, parliamentarian, and 2 Ex- Vox members supposed to be nominated by the Senate.",
      "The Review Board met once to discuss the contentions, and recommended that the article be taken down along with a formal communication to the GBM.",
      "To begin with, we argue that Vox was not fairly consulted in presenting their perspective on important contentions.An investigative piece spans months of preparation, with the Editors and the article team spending significant time drafting the piece with all its sources and claims.",
      "As a result, the Editors have a great deal of contextual knowledge about the article, the sources, and the claims made within it.",
      "We argue that the Editors’ views, for the most part, were not invited, and even where they were, their clarifications were not incorporated in the minutes that led to the said recommendations. This, for us, renders the Review Board’s Investigation incomplete.",
      "For example, Vox interviewed the DCL(Deputy Contingent Leader), 55th Inter IIT Sports Meet, who said (and we quoted) :“Anybody shouldn’t take POR for the sake of placement; rather, they should be motivated towards doing something big. Things were in place this time, but the Student Representatives as a whole lacked the zeal to win the Inter IIT.”",
      "The review board found that VOX had violated the“Journalism Ethics and Standards document” against the quotation itself, stating,",
      "The Board felt that B.5.1 was violated by the statements as they felt that the statements were highly opinionated and their repetitive mentions showed a lack of objectivity in themselves.",
      "At another place, the article quotes a coach saying :“The Ex-SPEC and GnS council was not providing us with these facilities…… [A coach regarding some facilities for teams].”",
      "To which the review board says :The Board acknowledged that the Games & Sports Council is not supposed to spend its budget on Inter IIT preparation as per the Constitution of the Students’ Gymkhana. Hence, it was found that the statement contained misinformation.",
      "Wherever the stakeholders, be it coaches, DCLs or Team Captain, have voiced concerns against PoR holders, the Review Board found that a violation had occurred.",
      "The events highlighted above set a dangerous precedent. This process of reviewing without",
      "1) having proper grounds",
      "2) giving Vox a chance to defend itself enables people in power to effectively use the Review Board as a censorship mechanism. This will make raising issues related to the Gymkhana / position holders very difficult and impede our ability to do meaningful journalism.",
      "Given these circumstances, we do not feel we were given an adequate space and a proper platform to present our views and thoughts on this matter. Clause B.1, Appendix B of the Journalism Ethics & Standards Document states that “It is expected that the board covers all perspectives before landing on a decision.” However, not all perspectives have been covered, and the investigation has been full of procedural errors",

      "The election for the position of the Student Senates’ Chairperson for the Incoming Senate (2024-25) took place onFebruary 9th, 2024, on the Senate Floor. During the meeting, 68 senators cast votes, and Ms. Vijaya Mishra received 36 votes, winning the election by a simple majority.",
      "OnMarch 20th, 2024– the 9th (Special) meeting of the Senate had an agenda item that proposed to introduceamendments to Appendix Fof the Constitution.This amendedthe eligibility toapply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhanafor PG Students. The attempt to amend this Appendix was made on the mailing list, followed by heavy back and forth by the senators, some of whom claimed the procedures followed were unconstitutional. On6th April, the Outgoing Chairperson considered the amendment “hereby ratified”, claiming consensus from the Senate.",
      "With the amendment in the background, in theJoint Senate Meetingon8th April 2024– before the outgoing chairperson ( Prashant ) could formally hand over the position, he announced that ano-confidence motionhad been raised against the newly elected Chairperson, Vijaya Mishra. This development led to immediate procedural complications, as the outgoing Chairperson had already vacated the chair. The No-Confidence Motion, among many things, was based on contentions againstVijaya’s academic eligibility. Pending this Verification from the DoAA office, the meeting was adjourned. The meeting was to reconvene on12th April at 20:30.On12th April at 18:17– the Chairperson received a response from the Joint Registrar, DoAA office, which stated:“Her academic status is active normal and she is not on warning”(Whether this clears the eligibility criteria awaits clarification). At19:57on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that thesenate meeting was postponeddue to “ambiguity in a few documents.”",
      "One of the agenda items of the meeting,“To consider the finalised versions of Constitution & Appendices”,was proposed to introduce amendments to Appendix F of the Constitution.  This included theeligibility to apply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhana for PG Students.",
      "However,the meeting was adjourned due to the heated environment that arose in the senatefollowingthe de-ratification of the Post Conduction Report for Galaxy, and it’s subsequent scrapping, and the issue was subsequently discussed over the senate’smailing list.On 6th April, the Outgoing Chairperson considered the amendment“hereby ratified”, claiming consensus from the Senate.",
      "Joint Meetings are special senate meetings designated to be a handing over session, where both members of the current and incoming senate are present as full-fledged members. The scheduled charge transfer process within the IIT Kanpur Student Senate was halted due to a series of events. The outgoing Chairperson, Mr. Prashant Kumar Mishra, began by presenting his end-termreport, which was passed by the Senate without any contentions.",
      "However, just before Prashant could formally hand over the position, he announced that a no-confidence motion had been raised against the newly elected Chairperson, Vijaya Mishra. This development led to immediate procedural complications, as the outgoing Chairperson had already vacated the chair.",
      "A heated discussion ensued on whether the incoming parliamentarian  (Mr Ujjwal) or the outgoing parliamentarian (Mr Abhiraj) should chair the proceedings. Ultimately, it was decided thatMr. Abhiraj would serve as the officiating Chairperson,since the charge transfer for Parliamentarians had not taken place yet.",
      "The No-Confidence Motion, among many things, was based on contentions against Vijaya’s candidature, one of which questioned her academic standing and eligibility to assume the Chairperson’s role. After a thorough debate themeeting was adjournedpending theDean of Academic Affairs’ response on Vijaya’s academic eligibility.The meeting was to reconvene on 12th April. On 12th April at 18:17 – the Chairperson received a response from the Joint Registrar, DoAA office, which stated: “Her academic status is active normal and she is not on warning”. At 19:57 on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that the senate meeting was postponed due to “ambiguity in a few documents.”",
      "Vijaya has accused that all of these events were politically motivated actions to prevent her from becoming the chairperson, even though she had been elected to the position through a free and fair democratic process. She had three specific allegations regarding the same:",
      "Vijaya’sfirst allegation concerns theamendment to Appendix F, passed over mail. This amendedthe eligibility to apply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhana for PG Students.She argues that the method through which this amendment was passed and implemented was questionable.",
      "However, there still remains ambiguity on the exact procedure to amend the academic eligibility requirements for the student senate (i.e. Appendix F), and clarification is awaited on the same.",
      "Vijaya claims that the correct procedure was not followed when the amendment was done.",
      "Vijaya’ssecond objectionpertains to the selection of the Chairperson’s nominee for the interviews to appoint coordinators of cells under the President’s Office. She argues that although it’s not mandatory, it’s established tradition for the incoming chairperson to be nominated, which would have been her in this case. However,Vijaya claims she was not appointed as the nominee for any of these interview processes,which she alleges was a discriminatory action against her.",
      "Vijaya has countered the claims of academic ineligibility against her by stating that she hasconclusive evidence that she fulfils the heightened academic criteria set by the Student Senate.She further argues that any amendments made by the Senate cannot be applied to her retrospectively.",
      "To reiterate, the part one presents one perspective on the recent charge handover proceedings held during the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate 2024. The situation remains under investigation, and a complete picture requires the perspective of all involved parties. Pending response from other stakeholders, updates will be published.",
      "Note: This draft is in continuation to Musical Chairs Part -1",
      "In his mail to the Students’ Senate dated 16/04/24, Prashant Mishra, Chairperson of Students’ Senate (2023-24), stated that Vijaya Mishra, the incoming Chairperson of Students’ Senate (2024-25), is ineligible to assume the aforementioned position under Appendix F which states that a person remains eligible if “They have notbeen placed on Academic Probation or Warning by the SUGC/SPGC”. The DoAA office on 10th April at 16:48 had mailed Prashant stating that Vijaya had received a “warning from SPGC for not completing her SOTA seminar in due time”.",
      "Prashant further stated the Charge Handover would resume on 2nd May 2024.",
      "However, trailing the same mail, Ujjawal, the incoming parliamentarian, Students’ Senate(2024-25), had opined that based on his interpretation of various arguments provided(which have been elaborated later), “Ms Vijaya’s academic status is Active Normal, leaving no further discussion on the matter.”",
      "The following article elaborates on the stance of various stakeholders regarding charge handover for the position of Chairperson, Students Senate.",
      "As stated in part one, the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate 2024 was supposed to reconvene on 12th April at 20:30 but at 19:57 on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that the senate meeting was postponed due to “ambiguity in a few documents.” When asked about what had happened, Prashant elaborated that he had sent a mail to DOAA on Tuesday (9th April, the day after the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate ) asking for clarification on whether Vijaya was under academic warning in lieu of her thesis credits and SOTA seminar as discussed in the Senate.",
      "To this, the DOAA office replied on Wednesday(10th April), stating that: Ms Vijaya’s “department had been communicated to issue her warning” based on her thesis credits. Additionally, she was also placed on “warning by the SPGC” for not completing her SOTA.",
      "However, on the day of the meeting(12/04/2024), the DOAA office again sent a mail to the Chairperson of the Students’ Senate at 16:48 . Following the previous mail, this mail had an addition to the first point, which stated that with respect to her thesis credits, “ Her academic status is normal/active, and she is not on any warning.” However, the second point of the mail, which mentioned that she had received a warning from SPGC regarding her SOTA, remained the same.",
      "These two seemingly contradictory points led to ambiguity according to Prashant. The offices were closed since it was Friday night; moreover, the DoAA was unavailable due to him being out of the station. Thereby, Prashant could not confirm Vijaya’s academic status and had to postpone the meet.",
      "Later, when the DoAA returned, the President and the Chairperson went to the DoAA office. As per Prashant, after confirming Vijayas’ academic eligibility from DoAA, he mailed the Students’ Senate, informing them that Vijaya was ineligible to become the Chairperson under Appendix F as she had received a warning from SPGC.",
      "In the first part of the article, Vijaya had alleged that “there has been a chain of concerted, politically motivated attempts to prevent her from assuming the Chairperson’s role.”",
      "To this, Dhwanit asserted that “I do not believe this all to be politically motivated, we do what is required, what is right, what follows the book. The amendment was to bring equality.”",
      "Regarding the amendment made to Appendix F over the mailing list, Prashant further clarified that on the matter of relaxing CPI criteria for PG students, he had asked to discuss and reform it through the academic senate because the criteria were sourced from the student governance report published by the academic senate. However, the same is not valid for every clause of Appendix F; hence, the SUGC warning clause was not considered to be in the jurisdiction of the Academic Senate.",
      "The Chairperson of the Students’ Senate has the sole right to determine who will become his nominee in the selection committee of overall coordinators of various cells in the upcoming tenure. Vijaya had claimed that her not being appointed as the nominee for any of the interview processes was discriminatory action against her as this was not in line with the tradition. Prashant agreed that his not nominating Vijaya was against the convention. However, he argued that the person taking the interview of OC of any cell should be very knowledgeable, and according to him, as per his experience in the senate with her, “Vijaya was not knowledgeable enough to interview anyone for the position of OC.”",
      "Prashant further adds that he had kept in mind that the incoming senate should have a say in appointments of OC of various cells; thus, all his nominees were incoming senators, whose credibility he justified based on their past experience in gymkhana. He reiterated that all the nominees for the interview process, including Dhruv, were part of the incoming senate.",
      "In contrast to Vijaya’s claim that amended criteria cannot be applied to her retrospectively, both Dhwanit and Prashant argued that everyone is required to maintain eligibility throughout their tenure; hence, the amended eligibility criteria would apply to them.",
      "On the claim that the amendment (to know in detail about the amendment, refer to part one) would restrict the participation of PG students and was targeted towards Vijaya, we spoke to Dhruv, the Incoming President of Students’ Gymkhana. He said that roughly similar numbers of both UG and PG students are placed under warning every year, and the reason they are asked to refrain from participation in Gymkhana activities is that they can focus on improving their academic record. Thus, placing similar restrictions on UGs and PGs doesn’t target anyone in particular.",
      "Additionally, regarding Vijaya’s academic status being reflected as “normal” in Pingala, Prashant elaborated that Appendix F mentions whether the person concerned had been placed under warning or not among several other criteria; the said appendix nowhere mentions eligibility in relation to “academic status.”",
      "As per the mail sent by Prashant on the Students’ Senates list, Vijaya is ineligible to become Chairperson. Prashant has also stated in the mail that the charge handover meet will convene on 2nd May.",
      "However, in a thread of the same mail, Ujjawal, the incoming parliamentarian, opined that Vijaya is academically eligible to become the Chairperson.",
      "The 3 points raised to support his interpretation were.",
      "Thereby, Ujjawal, the incoming Parliamentarian Students’ Senate, interprets that Ms Vijaya is eligible to hold the position of Chairperson of the Students’ Senate.",
      "Thus, the concerned stakeholders seem divided into two parties with conflicting opinions on Vijaya’s eligibility. With the charge transfer meeting to be held on 2nd May, we look forward to the conclusion of “Musical Chairs: Who sits when the music stops?”",
      "Note : This draft is the conclusion to the Musical Chairs Part 1 and Part 2",
      "On the 2nd of May, 2024,  the Students’ Senate reconvened. The proceedings commenced with Prashant declaring that Vijaya could no longer serve as the chairperson on the grounds of academic ineligibility. Subsequently, in order to facilitate the charge transfer, an officiating chairperson was appointed. Kinshuk Siyol, Senator BT/BS-MT/MS/MBA/MDes Y20, was elected for the position through a majority vote from the incoming Senate members.",
      "Following that, end term report presentation and charge transfer process took place for other executives :",
      "Mr. Kinshuk Siyol, (Officiating) Chairperson Students’ Senate",
      "Mr. Dhruv Misra, President, Students’ Gymkhana",
      "Mr Vaibhav Kadiyan, General Secretary, Games and Sports",
      "Mr Lakshay Gupta, General Secretary, Media and Culture",
      "Mr Hardik Agarwal, General Secretary, Science and Technology",
      "Mr Utkarsh Gupta, General Secretary UG, Academics and Career",
      "Mr. Yogesh Ram Gopal Singh, General Secretary PG, Academics and Career",
      "Mr. Srijan Kumar, Finance Convener, Students’ Senate",
      "Mr. Chiranshu Kataria, Convener, CoSHA",
      "As the round of Musical Chairs concludes and the new executives assume theircharge, the (Officiating) Chairperson is expected to conduct the re-elections for the post of Chairperson of the Students’ Senate soon.",

      "“Galaxy,” the renowned interhall cultural championship, is a pivotal component of the annual General Championship hosted by the Gymkhana at IIT Kanpur. It stands as a testament to the multifaceted talents present within the clubs of the Media and Cultural Council (MnC) while also serving as a talent scouting ground for exceptional individuals for the inter-IIT Cult Meet. Galaxy offers a dynamic platform for students to showcase their creativity, skills, and passions through a diverse range of competitions. This event not only encourages enthusiastic participation from freshers but also provides them with an immersive introduction to the rich cultural tapestry of IIT Kanpur.",
      "This year, the MnC council conducted its 39th Edition of Galaxy from 29th January 2024 to 12th February 2024.",
      "5 Pools participated in this competition, namely,  Aryans,  Nawabs, Kshatriyas, Peshwas and Shauryas.",
      "In the 9th special meeting of the Student’s Senate on 20th March 2024, the “Post Conduction Report ”, (PCR) of Galaxy’24 was to be discussed, and recommendations were to be provided. Usually, after the post-conduction report is passed, the results are formally announced, and the event comes to a formal end.",
      "Theofficial standingsof the pools according to the post-conduction report presented by the MnC Council in the Senate were :",
      "However, the post-conduction report was not passed in the Senate by a“majority”vote, and thus Galaxy’24 was scrapped.",
      "This trend of various events within the General Championship, such as Takneek and Galaxy, being scrapped for various reasons, has been observed for the past 2-3 years.In this article, we’ve explored a range of viewpoints and reasons behind the decision to scrap Galaxy’ 24, including perspectives from various stakeholders. We’ve also delved into the potential effects of this decision.",
      "The ultimate decision of whether Galaxy should be scrapped lies in the Students’ Senate’s hands. We talked with Prashant Mishra, the current Chairperson, Students’ Senate for the tenure 2023-24. Prashant emphasised that one of the significant reasons for Galaxy being scrapped is that halls are too obsessed with the tag and don’t want another hall to win it;",
      "“The root cause lies in how easy it is to invalidate the GC results at the end through the voting mechanism. Rationality and discussions hold no weight at the end. It’s so visible that every time, 4 pools will not win and only 1 would, the 4 or even fewer could just gang up to invalidate things through voting,cause no one comes to actually discuss things at the Senate Hall, but they come prepared with votes.” ~Prashant Mishra, Chairperson, Students’ (2023-24).",
      "Prashant further added that no event is perfect, and there are some flaws in every major event, but that doesn’t mean we should scrap the entire competition. He stated that“ there were no major blunders this time.”",
      "When asked what transpired in the Senate on the eve Galaxy was scrapped, Nitin Kumar, Institute Secretary, MnC, said that the senate meeting was quite chaotic.",
      "“Some pools came with clear intention  to scrap Galaxy and a few others wanted to defend, which resulted in chaos. We (Chairperson, President as well as the MnC core team) tried to have a proper discussion, but they all were not interested in listening and were just shouting. It was complete chaos so nothing we said mattered.” ~ Nitin Kumar, IS, MnC council",
      "Anjali Pandey, pool captain of Shauryas and Mayank Shekhar, pool captain of Aryans also reflected that there was not enough time provided to give clarifications. Without checking the credibility of claims made, voting was called too soon. Both of them added that technically, the pools weren’t allowed to raise contention in the Senate meeting since the deadline for raising it had already passed, but due to pressure from GBM, the contentions were taken up.",
      "In interviews with pool captains, a critical issue that emerged as a leading cause for the cancellation of Galaxy’24 was due to confusion on the part of the organising team, resulting in a mistaken swap of Hall 11 and Hall 7 between the Kshatriyas and Peshwas.",
      "However, Kaustubh Agarwal, General Secretary, MnC, clarified that this problem was acknowledged and resolved earlier in the pool captains meeting itself.",
      "Among the issues raised in the senate regarding Galaxy, a lot of them expressed concerns against the decision of the SGRC and GRC. Student Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) is constituted so that any grievances not solved by the organising team shall go to the SGRC. The SGRC comprised the following members, one from each pool:",
      "The Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) is constituted so that any grievances not solved by the organising team and SGRC shall go to the GRC. The GRC comprises of the following:",
      "According to the Pre conduction report of Galaxy, which was passed in the Senate,“the decision of GRC will be final; no reinvestigation related concerns shall be addressed further.”",
      "The SGRC considered seven contentions received via Google form floated.Notably, the contention regarding swapping of halls 7 and 11  was not one of the contentions. After deliberating on all the contentions, the positions of pools Aryans and Nawabs in the results were exchanged, with Aryans moving to 2nd place and Nawabs to 3rd. We further discussed this matter with committee members:",
      "According to Sheeshram, Sanmati and Nishi, members of SGRC had a calm and unbiased discussion on all the contentions, and unanimous decisions were taken by them.",
      "“Decisions were made on a rational basis, in reference to Pre Conduction Report as well as consultation with respective individuals if required.”~ Sanmati Pande, member of the SGRC",
      "Ayush Anand had a contrasting opinion regarding this. He felt that there existed a Hall Bias within SGRC. He pointed out that while the Pool captain of Nawabs had requested the opportunity to explain their side of the story in the contention document, they were not given the chance. In contrast, an individual from Pool Aryans, other than the pool captain, who had not explicitly requested a chance to provide clarification in the contention document, was afforded the opportunity to provide clarifications.",
      "“If every contention was discussed  properly , the standings would have remained the same. But logic took a backseat even in the SGRC meet.” ~ Ayush Anand, member of the SGRC",
      "The Pool Captain of Nawabs, Mukul Saini, also had issues with SGRC and GRC. He said that committees have been given excessive power, which can be used to change decisions and results without considering the opinion of MnC Gensec or Pool Captains. He believed that because the members of SGRC and GRC had no relation with the MnC Council, they did not have the expertise to deal with the contentions of Galaxy.",
      "Similarly, some members of the organizing committee contended that the senators lacked a comprehensive understanding of Galaxy, and therefore could not fairly determine whether Galaxy should be scrapped or not.",
      "As per Kaustubh, the SGRC is passed by the senate itself and thus is expected to be unbiased. He added that the contention filed is supposed to contain all the details required, and if further clarifications are needed, then SGRC contacts the core team and the pool captains.",
      "“The purpose of SGRC and GRC is to get an unbiased third perspective. If members of  these committees would be the MnC council core team themselves, then it would be no different from the pool captain meets.” ~ Kaustubh Agarwal, General Secretary, MnC.",
      "Some pool captains also cast doubt upon GRC, claiming that the professors are generally unaware, and essentially, the decision then rests with the Chairperson and President, who may have their own biases. Countering this, Kaustubh reiterated that the contention is supposed to contain the complete details; hence, like the SGRC, the GRC committee members are well informed, and then they come to a decision based on the facts presented.",
      "A clear divide seemed to be present in the viewpoint of the halls, with the Shauryas and Aryans on one side and the Nawabs, Peshwas and Kshatriyas on the other; however, one thing which was universally acknowledged was the waste of effort of the junior batches, especially the Y23 freshers.",
      "The pool captain of Nawabs, Mukul Saini, felt that there was a lot of bias in the conduction of events. He further added that “while some contentions had already been resolved and agreed to in the pool cap meets, the decisions were altered once they were raised in the SGRC.”",
      "“The major reason for scrapping Galaxy was lack of transparency in conduction and the biases of the organizing committee in some selective events” ~Gagan Kumar, pool captain of Peshwas",
      "However, Pool Aryans and Shauryas emphasized that all concerns had been thoroughly discussed, and they asserted that the other halls altered their statements during the Senate meeting.They also expressed regret over the growing hall divide and highlighted thatsenators often act solely as representatives of their respective halls.",
      "We sought the perspective of the organising team regarding the event as a whole. The core team members acknowledged their error in communication regarding the PG Hall Swapping. Despite attempting to address the issue during the pool captains’ meeting, after extensive deliberation, they collectively concluded that there was no feasible solution available, thus opting to move forward.",
      "Nitin Kumar, the Institute Secretary of the MnC Council, pointed out a crucial misunderstanding among certain pool participants regarding the subjective nature of cultural events. He mentioned that the Pre Conduction Report had been thoroughly discussed and presented to the Senate four days prior without any objections initially. However, objections in PCR arose later from the same individuals following their defeat.",
      "“The core team consists of 4 Members – 1 from Hall 3, 1 from Hall 12 and 2 from Hall 2, so the allegation of being biased towards Hall 6 or Hall 3 makes  no sense.” ~ Nitin Kumar, IS",
      "When asked about the absence of minutes of the pool captains’ meet, Nitin argued that there was no mandate about having minutes, and they made it clear in the meet itself that they are not maintaining minutes. The primary reason for that was the meetings were too long and chaotic, making it challenging to write minutes. However, he also suggests that minutes should be maintained from the next edition to prevent people from changing their statements later on.",
      "Several pool captains, as well as members of the organising committee and the SGRC, acknowledged that the efforts of over a thousand students of all halls were wasted.",
      "“Lot of juniors worked in Galaxy despite their quizzes, labs; yet they got no recognition; this will lead to a steep decrease in participation” ~ Aryan Prajapati,Cultural Secretary of Hall 2",
      "According to Anjali, this year’s Galaxy was especially important for Shauryas, who won for the first time in history.",
      "“ The participants had also invested in personal money for the event and the scrap had left them feeling disheartened. Students had given day and night for this event and some even broke down when they found out that their efforts will not be recognised.” ~ Anjali Pandey, Pool Captain, Shauryas.",
      "“Even the organising committee gets demotivated because even after investing a lot of time and effort, if the event gets scrapped without any concrete reasons then they have no scope of improvement in the upcoming tenure too and this trend of scraping would simply continue.” ~Kaustubh Agarwal, GenSec, MnC",
      "After Galaxy was scrapped, various proposals were made by the senators and the Chairperson on the senate list suggesting measures that could avoid the scrapping of GC in future. While such deliberations are underway it is to be noted that no rule is infallible, and if people are bent on misusing them, they would find one way or another.",
      "Pratyush Rai, the last Students’ Gymkhana President under whom the GC results were passed, said that it was saddening to hear about the Galaxy scrap, as it’s disheartening to the participating students who have put in so much effort.",
      "He stressed that it is imperative on the part of the organisers (i.e. Pool Leadership, Senate and Gymkhana) to ensure that conclusive results are shared. He highlighted that not sharing the final results leads to a public message of unprofessional conduct on the part of the organisers, as it indicates that we were not able to conduct one of the main Gymkhana events in a fair and impartial manner.",
      "He stated that historically, Gymkhana always tried its best to make sure that disputes are sorted during pool meets itself and senate-level discussions are avoided as pools typically have the most context of these matters and not the senate.",
      "“Hall culture reviving is a major win; it should be cherished.It leads to Mentorship, relationships for life; however, it should be maintained that it does not enter the Senate or Gymkhana politics.”",
      "~ Pratyush Rai, President Students’ Gymkhana (2018-19)",

As a part of IITK’s outreach programme and to positively impact the society in the neighbourhoods of IITK, Rozi Shiksha Kendra (RSK) was set up as an institute project to reach out to the nearby villages and contribute towards the employability of rural youth.

The project was established with a fund of around USD 1.8 million provided in November 2021 by the late Dr. Ranjit Singh (BT/MME/1965). Dr. Ranjit Singh was one of the pioneer batch students of IITK and earned a PhD from MIT working on artificial diamonds (cubic zirconia). Even after being highly successful in his career trajectory, he remembered his struggles growing up in a Kanpur Dehat village, walking miles to reach school.

      "The OREI Model of Education",
      "",
      "The Online Rural Education Initiative (OREI) is a method of teaching via smart classrooms, enabling IITK student volunteers to teach on a smart board and interact via a live camera feed with the school students. Initiated by RSK, the programme, in the words of Mrs. Rita Singh, Project Executive Officer, RSK, is “to ensure high-quality education for everyone – rich or poor, far or near“. For the programme, RSK onboarded two partner schools, one each in Bithoor and Lucknow, and with the aid of IITK tutors, started the initiative.",
      "",
      "Currently, each school has two allotted periods daily, during which RSK volunteers teach the students online. The students in classes 9th and 10th are taught mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry, following the NCERT curriculum. Students from IITK volunteer for 2 classes a week and the contribution by PhD candidates can also be counted towards their PMRF teaching duties. OREI today functions with around 30 student volunteers, numerous staff, and some experienced teachers, providing a model to bring high educational quality to schools in rural India.",
      "",
      "",
      "RSK, in collaboration with Shiksha Sopan, an NGO founded by Prof. HC Verma, a former faculty at the Department of Physics, IITK, has also developed a series of highly low-cost scientific experiments that can be easily replicated with minimal resources. Mrs. Rashika Awasthi, a research analyst at RSK, informed us, “We have developed 80 experiments in physics, chemistry and biology with detailed instruction manuals in English and Hindi, suited for live demonstrations in OREI classes”. Such experiments help students understand the concepts much better.",
      "",
      "Early Success",
      "",
      "The students and schools have responded positively to the OREI initiative, leading RSK to increase the frequency of online classes in the schools. While the program benefits students by helping in their learning process, it also provides a medium for IITK students to contribute towards societal development. According to the project in-charge, Mrs. Singh, “Through this programmegirls have benefitted immensely, as otherwise typically they are denied access to tutors and coaching. So we are also helping bridge the gender gap.”",
      "",
      "",
      "The Road Ahead",
      "",
      "In January 2024, the Government of Uttar Pradesh entered into an MoU with IITK to scale up OREI. On this, Prof. Sangal explains, “We have plans to scale up to 10 more schools in addition to the existing two via other partner institutions that are implementing the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA), who can provide much-needed offline volunteer support, such as in-person tutorials.” After the enthusiastic response from the students in the current schools, RSK will start tutorials for Class XI students in the science subjects, starting April 1, to prepare the students for the prestigious JEE examinations.",
      "",
      "The end goal of OREI, as Mrs. Rita Singh explains, is “to create our very own Khan academy while also providing much-needed live interaction via a tech-enabled and volunteer-driven programme.” She adds, “IITK is the perfect launchpad for this initiative, given its strong volunteering culture, best resource persons for pedagogy and curriculum design, and an invaluable alumni network. It provides an excellent opportunity for students studying at IITK to contribute to nation-building and understand rural society.”",

      "In this piece, Vox delves into the intricacies of SnT teams’ funding, organisational structure, and workspace challenges faced by them. It highlights the disparities between current regulations and operational reality while also examining potential solutions and alternative models adopted by other IITs. To provide a well-rounded perspective, our investigation included consultations with the teams themselves, the core team members of the SnT council, administrative officials, faculty advisors, and teams from other IITs.",
      "Teams from IIT Kanpur have the chance to showcase the institute’s engineering and technical excellence on both national and international platforms through various competitions. Competitions are an opportunity for these teams to show the world what students of IIT Kanpur are truly capable of.",
      "Moreover, these teams actively contribute to academic research. According to Prof. Indranil Saha, Faculty Advisor for Team ERA and Team AUV, the experience gained by these teams in competitions enables them to contribute to externally funded research projects. The experimental setups created by the teams for testing their models become valuable resources for researchers, bridging the gap between undergraduate students and academic research. Additionally, working on competition problems exposes teams to practical applications of theoretical analysis, empowering them to enhance existing methods and address gaps, essentially contributing to systems research.",
      "While SnT teams actively participate in various competitions, there’s untapped potential for securing more prizes in prestigious national and international events. We still have a long way to go to develop something of global recognition, such as an internationally acclaimedhyperloop by IITM. In a candid discussion with various SnT teams, Vox uncovered the aspirations, challenges, and recurring issues hindering their progress.",
      "In October 2023, the teams secured a funding of 44 lakhs from the institute, following extensive efforts led by the SnT core team and the administration.",
      "However, it must be noted that in this period teams did receive funding from external sources through CSR and sponsorship deals. For example, in March 2023 teams received a combined funding of around 16 lakhs from a company called Noccarc but that was not enough for many.",
      "This is what the teams said in their interviews-",
      "“Teams lack long-term funding plans and rely on short-term bursts of income.”“Limited funds restrict participation in competitions”–  Atulya, Team Head, Aerial Robotics",
      "“The team has existing functioning hardware but lacks funds to build new hardware and participate in competitions.”– Kushal, ex-Team Head, AUV",
      "“We had financial problems until October 2023. Although we have enough money now, it will only last for a few months. Hence, we are looking for another round of funding so that we can establish ourselves to get sponsorships”– Emaad, Team Head, ERA",
      "“Insufficient funds have caused delays in the timeline for building the car.”“Paperwork is difficult and time-consuming due to strict auditing rules and logistics.”– Anchit, Team Head, IITKMS",
      "“Shortage of resources puts us at a disadvantage compared to other institutions that can freely build robots without hardware constraints. In contrast, we must operate within budget constraints, resulting in the need to build robots under limiting hardware conditions.”– Aadvik, Team Head, Humanoid",
      "Although the problem of funding has been temporarily solved, the challenge lies in the absence of a continuous funding pipeline for the teams, as a 44 lakh grant from the institute might not be a recurring source.",
      "The Current Funding Mandate",
      "In the interviews, some team members pointed fingers at the SnT core team, contending that the council does not actively pursue funds for teams within the yearly gymkhana budget. This stands in contrast to the systematic yearly allocation of funds to clubs and societies, fostering a perception of discrimination towards the teams.",
      "In response to these claims, Nishi Mehta, the Institute Secretary, Teams and Research of the SnT council, clarifies that their mandate doesn’t encompass funding teams. He explained that while clubs and societies, cater to the broader student community as open-to-all entities, teams operate differently. Teams are more focused and exclusive, with specific goals such as building robots or winning competitions and hence operating as closed groups. As clubs and societies cater to the broader student community, they are liable to receive the gymkhana funds obtained from students’ fees, but teams, being closed groups, are not.",
      "According to him, the council is committed to providing support instead of directly funding them. Financing multiple teams becomes a challenge, especially when the requirements of a single team surpass the entire SnT council budget. For instance, the SnT council’s gymkhana budget for this term amounted to approximately13 lakhs, whereas the proposed budget for Team ERA alone was around18 lakhs.",
      "TheConstitution of the Students’ Gymkhanamentions this in Chapter V, Article 23, wherein it states –",
      "“Teams shall be approved by the Senate on the recommendation of an Executive only if they have a validated source of funds. They shallnotbe allowed to use any funds from the Gymkhana.”",
      "This clarifies that the responsibility for acquiring funds, managing logistics, and handling operations rests entirely on the teams, rather than on the council. This is further emphasized in the PoR handbook where it’s mentioned that teams are recommended to have non-technical heads of finance, marketing and media.",
      "However, as an initiative, the SnT Council, in its past tenures, created a concept of “Council Projects”, through which teams could initiate projects with its team members, and the Council would provide a seed fund that teams could use to proceed with the projects they proposed, either partially or completely. The Council only limited the funds to projects and not the wider aim of the teams – to participate in competitions nationally or internationally.IITK Rocketry and Space Exploration Team (IITK-RaSET) is one such council project.",
      "What does the Administration Think About Teams’ Funding?",
      "To understand the administration’s perspective on funding for teams, we talked to theDean of Resources & Alumni (DoRA), Prof. Kantesh Balani.",
      "He explained to us that over the years, the extramural government grants have been reduced given that the older IITs have shown their capability to raise additional resources through CSR, projects, patents, and other alumni funding. The funding from the government is provided through loans for undertaking infrastructure projects like establishment of new laboratories and purchase of high-end research equipment, etc. To foster industry-academia collaboration, the government has launched a plethora of schemes with participation from the industry, with bridge funding by the government.",
      "An inference from this shift in the economics of our institute is that while student bodies like SnT Teams can obtain some additional funding from the institute, teams must also focus on external sources from the industry.",
      "However, the he told us that when a group of students come up with an idea to participate in a prestigious competition by working on cutting-edge technology, the institute can support from internal resources and/or solicit support from potential donors, which may assist them in developing the initial prototype.",
      "He emphasized that it is important for a team to have a long-term and sustainable plan that ensures healthy progress towards competitions instead of a one-tenure annual plan. He believed that this long-term planning would create the possibility to get funding throughfixed endowments from the institute’s donors. However, he also mentioned that short-term plans (any urgent need of funds, say to buy hardware or travel abroad) would require extra efforts. According to him, teams should market their progress to visitors, alumni, and external funding sources and look for sponsors, and be a synergistic factor in securing funds for the institute. The most probable sources of money would be through CSR, Alumni, and corporations looking to fund research in their interest areas.",
      "According to him, it is imperative to recognize that securing funding is a vital aspect of running a team, complementing their engineering and research efforts. A collaborative effort is needed to secure funding, as the technical team possesses in-depth knowledge about the intricacies of their technical work and an effective program/proposal can be packaged by IITK Development Office to the right donors to support the cause.",
      "“Teams shallnotbe a part of any other entity under the Gymkhana and shall be headed by one or more Captains appointed by the Senate.”– Chapter V, Article 24",
      "This rule indicates that teams cannot be a part of the organizational structure of SnT council but instead are a separate entity in the Gymkhana. This is more clearly shown in the Appendix D of Constitution of the Students’ Gymkhana where teams are not mentioned under the SnT council and in thePoR handbookon pages 15 and 25 where teams are described separately.",
      "However, there is an apparent contradiction between the legislative framework governing teams and observed reality. In the status quo, teams are considered as a part of the SnT council but according to the Student Gymkhana’s current legislature, they are not.",
      "The support SnT council provides to teams is not well defined and varies from tenure to tenure. This raises questions on the identity of teams and points out the unclear association between the council and the teams which majorly seems to depend on the discretion of the governing SnT core team.",
      "To understand possible alternative models, Vox contacted teams of other IITs from which teams of IITM and IITB responded.",
      "Organizational StructureTeam Raftaar, IITM’s Motorsport team has a 3-tier structure, with fourth-year students forming a core team at the top. In our discussion with a senior team member of Raftaar, we learned that the core team does the job of raising funds and ensuring that the team has access to resources and connections to the industry.",
      "We were told that while teams are supported financially byCenter For Innovationto some extent (CFI is IITM’s parallel body to the SnT Council), it is not enough, and every team is expected to have their own finance and logistics verticals to source deals.",
      "This is in contrast with our institute, where 4th year students don’t usually be a part of their teams and many of the teams do not extensively focus on finance & logistics.",
      "During our conversation with a member ofTeam AeRoVe at IITB, we learned thattechnical teams do not have parent student body like Gymkhana or CFI. Instead, teams are associated with an institute body called Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC).",
      "Financial Support from Administration/Gymkhana",
      "At IIT Madras, every team typically secure funding ranging from 4 to 7 lakhs per annum through the Gymkhana, facilitated by the Center for Innovation (CFI). Whereas at IIT Bombay, each team receives a funding of around 15 lakhs per annum through Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC), IITB.",
      "However, it’s noteworthy that teams at both institutions actively pursue additional funding from external sources. We were told that the IITB’s Racing team had a total corpus of ~5 Cr, while Team Agnirath at IITM, which was established in 2021, raised a funding of 1.5+ Cr.",
      "Industry Connect.A common factor that was mentioned in our interviews with teams’ heads was the relationships that teams have developed with companies through campus events and their alumni in associated sectors.",
      "One team head mentioned that one of the ways that they garnered visibility and marketed themselves to big sponsors was to go to events and startups in the Research Park of IITM. For example, Team Agnirath, a team that creates solar cars, managed to tap Reliance as their main sponsor by connecting with them at an energy conference. Teams also take the help of their faculty advisors’ industry contacts to get their foot in the door.",
      "OutreachWe were told that CFI has a dedicated managerial team spending its resources on maintaining outreach programs likeOpen House& Research Conclave, and regularly updated social media pages, giving a good public image to interested sponsors. Apart from marketing the teams’ work and building connections, these initiatives are beneficial in cases where donors are more willing to donate to institutional bodies than individual teams.",
      "We asked Nishi, IS Teams & Research about the outreach of SnT council. He told us that although we have an Outreach and Connect Wing it is very inactive.",
      "According tohttps://sntiitk.com/, the mandate of the wing the following –“Outreach & Connect Wing under SnT Council is responsible for building and sustaining Industrial, Research, and Alum collaborations of the council, gaining Projects and Sponsorships from them and passing them on to the Clubs/Teams/Hobby Groups under the Council, essentially being the centre of all the external affairs of the Council.”",
      "In the pursuit of innovation and problem-solving, teams often encounter a significant obstacle: the lack of adequate workspace. From managing inventory to collaborating effectively, the absence of a dedicated and permanent area proves to be a recurring obstacle for many.",
      "Some teams like Aerial Robotics and AUV are have a designated room in the Halls of Residences. Team Motorsports has its workspace right next to MT and also works at the central workshop. Teams like Team ERA, Humanoid and Vision often work in the labs assigned to their faculty advisor or a temporary workspace that they get through similar recommendations on an ad-hoc basis.",
      "“We currently have no workspace causing unnecessary delays and loss of productivity”  –Team ERA",
      "However, these arrangements, while functional, do not fully address the limitations concerning space for inventory, development and testing as multiple teams still face space issues. As a result, they do not adequately facilitate the collaborative and innovative atmosphere required for cutting-edge research and development.",
      "One notable facility is theSudha and Shankar Innovation Hubat IITM.",
      "In this building, competition teams have a large spacious corridor on the ground floor where they can store their inventory, work on their projects and test their prototypes in a collective space.",
      "There are labs where teams conduct in-house experiments –  a 3D printing room and a server room that house one of the most powerful computing systems in their campus, second only to the main supercomputer at the computer center. These rooms assist in smooth conduction of high level simulations of the CFI teams.",
      "The first floor is allotted to hardware clubs and is shared with Nirmaan, a pre-incubator. Nirmaan acts as a conduit between the GBM and IIT Madras Research Park incubation cell, and further guides these groups to materialize their ideas into successful businesses.",
      "Here are some of the pictures –",
      "",
      "Currently on our campus, the Students’ Gymkhana has requested the administration to allocate permanent space for multiple clubs and teams in the Old-SAC building. An agreement has been reached with the administration. However, its implementation is still pending.",
      "The challenges faced by IIT Kanpur’s SnT Institute Teams, from funding shortages to organizational ambiguities and workspace constraints, highlight the complexities of student-driven innovation. While recent funding efforts provide a temporary solution, a sustainable financial model remains elusive. Clearer organizational structures and proactive fundraising strategies, as seen in models from institutions like IIT Madras and IIT Bombay, offer valuable insights for improvement.",
      "In navigating these challenges, collaboration and strategic planning are paramount. By leveraging industry connections, alumni support, and institutional resources, the teams can overcome obstacles and achieve greater success. Additionally, addressing workspace limitations is crucial for fostering an environment conducive to innovation and collaboration.",
      "Despite the hurdles, the potential for growth and recognition on national and international stages is evident. With determination and collective effort, SnT Teams can realize their aspirations and continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in science and technology.",

      "Siddharth, GSOC:I wanted to utilize my first summer and get some work experience. If I hadn’t gone through GSOC, I would’ve tried to get this experience some other way.",
      "Q. How did you prepare for it?",
      "Pratyush:One should start passively preparing for it in January, shortlist organizations, and contact the mentors via Slack or email before the organizations get declared.",
      "Siddharth:I have done courses in the R language. So, I specifically focused on R and R-based communities.",

      "Q. What did you do in moments of frustration or when there was no progress?",
      "Mihir, GSOC:Many times, we write code without understanding it because there are many open sources. The more important thing is to understand the code rather than copying it.",
      "Pratyush, GSOC:Sometimes, I was just resolving bugs for 30 days. It was frustrating. I remember that during that time, I read a lot. I had some 100 tabs open in my browser, and often, solutions to most of the complex bugs turned out to be just going back to fundamentals",
      "Shrish, GSOC:I would say, Just keep on learning. There are moments when it seems no progress is being made, but if you grind through it, you will see results.",

Therefore, the counsellors only share Information to me, if administrative support is required, and even then, it’s only after obtaining the student’s consent.Concerning the student-supervisor conflict, my observation is that it is mostly due to a lack of communication between the student and supervisor. IIT Kanpur has several mechanisms in place to resolve this problem, for example, DPGCs, Doctoral Monitoring Committees, DSAC etc. However, there is a definite need to enhance their effectiveness and develop a more PG student-friendly environment in the campus.”",

I believe involvement of PhD students in the ICS is crucial, though currently, their participation is significantly low, sometimes even non-existent. It is essential to acknowledge that PG students at IIT Kanpur, including PhD candidates, experience a journey distinct from that of our UG students. They engage in specialized coursework, devote more time to research-sometimes alone in the lab, and often juggle family responsibilities and future career planning.  Given these unique challenges and staying inside a campus, PG students must establish a harmonious presence on campus and maintain a healthy work-life balance. If more PhD students join the ICS, it will make the support system better for all postgraduate students at the institute, as it will meet their specific needs and requirements.”",

Different departments – even different specializations/fields in the same department – can have very different timelines for executing research work. Some fields might be more competitive than others regarding hiring prospects post-PhD. This needs to be considered while comparing PhD completion times across departments. However, some factors – as rightly pointed out in the survey – are common pain points, and the Institute bodies are trying to iron out issues. The process of consensus building has been slow since different departments and faculty members have very diverging viewpoints, but it is happening. The Institute needs to realize that the glamour of a PhD degree, even in the IITs, is declining rapidly due to word of mouth, and the program will soon have an existential crisis if concrete steps are not taken to address the time delays and other concerns.“",

The director responded that this is one of the primary works of the 5 member committee that the institute is proposing. The current mechanism involves HoD, supervisor, and warden, which does not allow us to express our problems freely. The director responded that such a mechanism would be implemented. After multiple requests, the director agreed to have a similar open session on the committee’s progress.

They are discussing the mental therapy reimbursement with the insurance company. The director is now addressing students’ individual questions.

      "Time: 2:15 PMProf Shalabh, mentioned that his first priority is the family of the student. Additionally, the student had joined 2 weeks back, so there is limited data with DOAA office.

      "On the 5th of January, 2024, at 11:30 am, Dhobighat experienced a power outage in its main premises, which, as of now, remains unresolved. This outage has impacted the living conditions of six quarters, accommodating over six families and 30+ individuals. Dhobis, the laundry service providers, allege that this incident is part of a continued effort by the administration to challenge the legitimacy of their occupancy on campus.",
      "In the aftermath of this occurrence, our team conducted an on-site visit to Dhobighat to delve deeper into the matter and gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation.",
      "When the Institute was established, founding Director Prof Kelkar invited a group of dhobis to address the laundry needs of campus residents. Over the years, responsibilities passed down generations, with more families taking up washing work to serve the laundry needs of the growing student body. With the passing of the original male members, their children haven’t been formally allotted the property, forming the basis for the claim of illegal occupancy.This issue has drawn attention before, with Vox covering it in 2016 and 2023.",

      "Following the power outage, the Dhobis approached the power substation seeking answers. Officials there suggested it might be an electricity fault and advised them to consult IWD Electricals. According to the Dhobis, IWD engineers attributed the issue to non-payment of electricity bills during the lockdown, a claim disputed by the Dhobis, citing financial challenges due to a lack of work. Eventually, the Electrical officials directed the Dhobis to seek resolution from the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DoIP)."

      "In this interview, we sit down with Sayash Kapoor, a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy. After graduating from IIT Kanpur with a BTech in Computer Science in 2019, Sayash’s work in machine learning methods and their applications in science has earned recognition from publications like WIRED, LA Times, and Nature. Recently named among TIME’s 100 most influential people in AI, alongside his Ph.D. supervisor, Dr. Arvind Narayanan, Sayash shares insights into their academic journey and the evolving landscape of technology.",
      "",
      "Let’s start this interview with a trip down memory lane and talk about your early campus stories. What are your most memorable moments from your campus life?",
      "I got involved with ELS because they host Freshers Nite, and I was an anchor for the Y15 Freshers. It was an enjoyable group.  However, I was much more involved with DebSoc when it came to how much time I spent there. When I joined IITK, there was no such thing as a DebSoc, and hence, no people who used to debate. Arnav Mehta, a Y14, led the effort by speaking to first-year Y15 students in humanities courses and asking them to create DebSoc. In my first year, we went to a few tournaments, and in my second year, we converted DebSoc from an interest group to a Club. I became one of the Coordinators. In my third year, I went to an exchange program at EPFL. When I came back in my fourth year, we became one of the first teams to “break” in a debating tournament from IITK (breaking is the equivalent of moving into the knockout stage following a league stage). Debating played a significant role in shaping my life at IITK, and going to these tournaments with a group of 20-odd people led to some of my best memories from my campus life.",
      "I also liked singing and playing the guitar(I still do). I did not pursue it formally, but I did participate in Galaxy, and one thing that we used to do after every fest was that a bunch of us would just go around singing songs in the streets.",
      "What were the initial projects that got you interested in pursuing your research in AI & Policy?",
      "While I joined as an undergrad, I was fortunate that Prof. Purushottam Kar joined the faculty. He was looking for students, so I worked with him in my first summer and did a UGP under him for the following two semesters. These projects set me up for my research career. Coursework is excellent, and IITK does a great job compared to Princeton or EPFL in laying great foundations, but if you want to do research, you just have to get into it with a researcher.",
      "Among other things, Puru does theoretical machine learning, and back then, I was interested in theory. So, in my third semester, I started a project with him on how to make machine learning algorithms more robust to insufficient data. How can we ensure the algorithms work as intended if some of your data is corrupted? I started working on this in my third semester, and we published it by my third or fourth year. That set me up for the rest of my research career. Computer Science PhD admissions are pretty competitive, especially in machine learning. To pursue a Ph.D. in any of the top schools in the US, there’s an unsaid rule that you have a paper or two already published. The project also helped me get research experience at EPFL, and basically, it kick-started my research career.",
      "Summer@EPFL and EPFL semEx are extremely sought-after programs that receive many applications from our campus and are famous for being extremely selective. Having studied in the Semex program, could you talk briefly about why you opted for the EPFL exchange program and how it impacted your life?",
      "Before we decided to apply, I had long conversations with one of my closest friends (Kumar Kshitij Patel) about whether we should go for the exchange or stay in Kanpur. In the end, we both applied and studied at EPFL. It came down to the fact that we had yet to study in any country outside of India, and at that moment, all other factors seemed inconsequential. The other thing that helped me out was that we were in this together, which made everything so much easier. In my second year, we only used to think about what we would do in the following semester (or maybe even over just the next two weeks); hence, many of our decisions also boiled down to randomness. At the end of the day, it seemed like it would be an exciting experience, so we did it",
      "",
      "Your journey into the industry is something many people would really admire. Could you elaborate a bit about how you joined Meta and how was your early experience working in the industry?",
      "I interned at Facebook at the end of my third year and received a PPO following that. I took a corporate intern over a research opportunity because I’d never worked in the industry before and wanted to see what that was like. Also, I’d heard great things about the UK and wanted to experience living there.",
      "The decision to take a break from academia and join the industry was pragmatic. In my fourth year, I worked on a startup, and one of the reasons I accepted the PPO was that if the startup did not work out, then I had someplace to go (and that indeed ended up happening). You can’t do that with a Ph.D. Another reason to consider the PPO is that Ph.D. programs pay you exceptionally poorly, even in the US, and it’s nice to have a little bit of financial cushion to fall back upon. Finally, I just wanted the experience to know the counterfactual, understand what I am rejecting, and understand both life in academia and the industry.",
      "I joined Facebook with another of my IITK batch mates and close friends, Yash Srivastav. While working at Facebook, we continued to live like students. I am fortunate enough to have good friends accompany me at each step of my journey. We spent little, and Facebook makes it easy to do so, for example, by giving you all meals in the office, and we made use of those perks quite a bit. As a result, when I returned to academia, I did not feel like there was a significant lifestyle change when I started my Ph.D. here at Princeton",
      "What were the projects that you worked on during your time at Facebook?",
      "Going into Facebook, I was well aware that I was not aligned with many of Facebook’s incentives.  However, some teams at Facebook were more aligned with my values and joined the self-harm prevention team, where our task was to use machine learning to figure out who was more likely to hurt themselves or attempt suicide and then take real-world action to prevent such a situation, such as by informing suicide helplines and self-help centers. That was the first half of my tenure there, and 6-7 months into my period at Facebook, COVID-19 started, and there was a massive rush of misinformation online about COVID-19. Hence, towards the latter half of my tenure, I led a team to deal with the spread of such misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. That was my last project until I left in December 2020.",

      "Big Tech often comes in the midst of a lot of controversy especially since AI has come, especially companies like Meta, Google, etc. How would you say that your time at Meta shaped your worldview about AI and policy-making around AI in general?That’s a great question. So when I joined Meta, they were in the midst of implementing all the changes they needed by GDPR. I think I really did see, to some extent, the impact policy can have on tech companies. So here’s a company that has billions of dollars at its disposal, having to scramble to meet the needs of a single European regulator. In many cases, I’ve seen one regulator in one country in the EU demanding something from Meta, and then the company scrambles for resources to fulfill that request. So, I think regulation can go a long way, even if it can’t solve all the problems created by big tech. For example, one of the issues that we’ve increasingly seen is privacy. I think the EU has a good model for addressing privacy concerns, and we should learn from that. Of course, there are problems with that, too, and we need to learn from these problems and fix them as we go along. I’ve tried to carry that through in my work at Princeton and CITP. We’ve been attempting to engage with the policymakers to see if we can help inform them, especially with so much lobbying and misinformation from tech companies. I would like to think we’ve been somewhat successful, but there’s more work to be done. The other limiting factor, I think, in many cases is the incentives for researchers to do this kind of work because researchers are more often incentivized to publish as much as they can. You know, like write more papers, write more grants, and keep the cycle running, and at some point, researchers should ask: What’s the point of this loop of writing papers, winning grants, writing papers, writing grants, and so on? Is it just a hamster wheel we are stuck on? One of the things I like about my current institute is that policy impact is the real focus. So, we aren’t just incentivized to write papers. We’re incentivized to write papers that have a policy impact down the road. This would not be possible in a typical research institution if I spent 80% of my time thinking about how to write more papers.",

      "Many students are often confused about choosing placements over research opportunities or vice-versa because of the factor of uncertainty. Some believe there is a barrier to entry into academia after working in the industry. What are your views on returning to academics after working in the industry for some time?",
      "My somewhat controversial opinion is that everyone who wants to pursue research should work in the industry for a year or two for a few reasons. First, if you have published research work, then by the time you get to academia, that work is better known, and people have had time to cite it. Second, suppose you don’t have prior research publications. In that case, publishing papers is comparable to a lottery. This study was conducted by NeurIPS, where two independent committees reviewed the same set of papers. They disagreed about whether a paper should be accepted about 50% of the time—so paper acceptances are to some extent like a coin toss. Hence, working in the industry for a year or two gives you the time to babysit these submissions, revise the paper, and publish it. This significantly increases your probability of having some research published by the time you apply for grad school.",

      "How would you describe the area of interest for your research?",
      "The field that I am interested in is AI and policy. However, since it is such a large field, I’ve been focusing on what AI is and what it can and cannot do for the last couple of years. AI is an umbrella term for a broad spectrum of technologies in the status quo. For example, AI is great at “perception tasks”— like identifying an image or the tone of speech for a particular text. However, it fails when it is used for “prediction tasks,” like predicting whether a person who is out on bail will commit a crime or whether a person will pay back their loan on time. AI is extremely bad at these tasks. Clarifying what AI can and cannot do has been the focus of my research. I’ve looked at many applications of AI, notably where AI has failed. For example, my first research project was reviewing a model that claimed to predict with 99% accuracy whether a region is prone to civil unrest and, ultimately, a civil war. When we dug into these claims, we discovered that this entire branch of political science—known as civil war prediction—was based on errors. When we removed these errors, their machine-learning models could not outperform two decades-old logistic regression. We did not go into this project to disprove the proposed models’ accuracy but rather with optimism for ML and the extent to which these models could be applied. However, through this and several other examples, we discovered that the predictions these models make often tend to be inaccurate, and hence, machine learning should not be used everywhere.",

      "And when we talk about delivering this impact through your research. What was your first reaction when you were featured in time? Do you feel that that was a big step in the direction of you making the impact that your research needs to me?",
      "Maybe- I don’t know. I think it’s helpful to be featured in time because your work can reach more people, but it’s also important to remember that it is just a list. Who gets in and who gets out is a highly arbitrary process, and there are many, many people who are doing work that is probably more important than ours who weren’t featured. One thing to note is that who gets featured on lists like these is also a very political decision. It’s a political decision of who is safe enough to put on these lists. So, for example, if someone who is more open or who has ideas that are more radical than ours or who thinks like, you know, basically maybe the entire premise of AI is mistaken and we should basically ban a lot of this technology, they probably wouldn’t be featured in a list like this simply because their opinions are too far outside the Overton window. The list is not just about merit but also about what ideas are amenable to the views that Time as an institution wants to espouse. Time is a very centrist, long-standing institution, right?",
      "At the same time, it’s great that our work can reach more people — that’s always a pleasure, but I think a lot of the impact on policies is not hard through public conversation. If you want to influence policymakers, you must talk to staff members about what they’re looking for. Again, The Time feature can help because it’ll lead us to be asked for more of these meetings on policy conversations or give us more influence, but eventually, it is just a means to the end. It is not an end in itself—ensuring that policy is just and fair is yet to be done",
      "A lot of claims, especially in political science and humanities papers, are based on huge datasets. The findings of such studies are then extrapolated on larger umbrella populations, like a whole city or even country without any logical reasoning backing that. Have you encountered this anywhere?",
      "Yeah, yeah, definitely. What you’re describing is called overfitting to the training distribution, where you make predictions without deploying the application in the real world and checking how well it works. While it happens in a lot of cases, I think sometimes it’s fine because the stakes are low. No one reads a lot of these papers, so you can publish what you want, and it won’t have any real-world impact. But this becomes more problematic when it distorts how we think about scientific research or real-world applications. For example, we don’t even need to go into political science or social science. Computer scientists are doing this today. One example is when the GPT 4 paper was released, OpenAI claimed that GPT4 outperforms the 90th percentile lawyer who took the bar exam, and that was based on testing GPT4 on a real-world bar exam and looking at its score. That’s all fair. But the way this was interpreted was that GPT4 can replace lawyers. The issue with that framing is that lawyers aren’t just taking bar exams all day. That’s not their job. So, what the tests are measuring in lawyers is something very different from what tests measure for AI tools. In an AI tool, all it’s measuring is its ability to memorize facts and details and how similar examples are answered in past bar questions. Whereas for humans who cannot memorize, you know, the entire constitution or whatever, these tests measure something else. It’s the ability of humans to respond to these new situations. So, when we conflate these two things, we are misinforming a considerable chunk of the public about what these tools can and cannot do. And I think the widespread perception that AI will soon replace all jobs or most jobs is partly because of these misleading comparisons that companies like to publish.",
      "You talked about the notion of AI replacing jobs, which is often discussed at IIT Kanpur as well. Do you believe that AI will replace a lot of jobs in the future?",
      "As I just said, our work found that performance on benchmark data sets is not reason enough to believe claims of job displacement since benchmarks are very different from real-world applications. Performance on benchmark data sets is very different from the real-world application. That’s it. On the other hand, I think we’re already seeing some effect on jobs in the real world. For people who translate texts, people who transcribe video calls, and so on, AI is more likely to replace them. We have a transcription tool currently running in this meeting. Such tools have become good in the last few years. And I do think there’s a significant probability that if not replaced entirely,  AI will make it so that there are fewer jobs available. The jobs available are lower paid because instead of transcribing a whole transcript, workers are only asked to edit transcripts that AI has already instead of transcribing an entire transcript produced. In part, I think this transitional phase is extremely problematic because often, in editing those transcripts, you might have to do more work than was required to make the transcripts in the beginning. And so the only reason that you can pay these workers less is because you have more bargaining power in the hands of the employers. So essentially, what AI will have done is not making it easier for us to do some tasks like perfect transcription, but rather it is shifting the power away from workers, who have to negotiate much harder or might not be paid as much, into the hands of the employers who now can say that, “Oh, if you don’t do it for this price, we can just use an AI to do the task even if it doesn’t work as well.” This same phenomenon is happening across many industries. I think copywriters, especially junior copywriters, are seeing these effects.",
      "At the same time, I think it’s always hard to predict the impact of automation on any industry. For example, there’s this thing called Jevon’s paradox, which says that as some technology becomes cheaper, it can have two effects. It can either automate away some jobs or make some tasks so affordable that it creates more demand for these jobs. So, for example, when automated teller machines were introduced, lots of people thought that bank tellers would be out of jobs because there was essentially no work for them to do anymore. What happened instead was that creating a bank branch initially required lots of money, and one had to hire a whole team of people to service customers and so on. With ATMs, this process has become much cheaper. And so as a result, the number of bank branches just exploded, and ATMs had the opposite effect. ATMs ended up leading to more bank tellers being employed rather than less, and we’re at the start of this new technology as well. I think it’s hard to predict, overall, what the impact on jobs will be. It’s not a linear process where, you know, AI can do one task, which means that a job goes away. I think there are many other dynamics about how the market reacts, what the prices are, how the prices are affected, how much demand there is, and so on.",
      "Context Note:“Coded Bias” is a documentary on Netflix directed by Shalini Kantayya. Released in 2020, the film explores the societal implications of biased algorithms and artificial intelligence systems. It primarily focuses on Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, who discovers significant racial and gender biases in facial recognition technology. The documentary delves into the broader issues of algorithmic bias and its impact on privacy, civil rights, and social justice.",
      "Source:Link",
      "The paper “Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification” was a seminal work by Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru, and others. It was presented at the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT/ML) in 2018 and has been instrumental in shedding light on the biases present in commercial gender classification systems, particularly those based on facial analysis.Source:Link",
      "",
      "There is this documentary on Netflix called Coded Bias which talks about algorithm ethics in the context of facial recognition and mortgage decisions by banks. Given the fact of how much corporate influence is over the government, especially in the United States, how do we go about tackling these issues? So, just an example, big tech has a dangerous amount of power which is only going to increase. They already influence many government decisions and try to make them go in their favour. Do you have any views on how we could counteract this influence and move forward as a community and a society to a more fair and just system?",
      "That’s a great question. I think we’ve had some examples of how to deal with this enormous amount of concentrated power in the past. In the US, we’ve also had examples where these big companies were broken up, and there are already proposals in the US about breaking up big tech. For example,  Meta might be split under such proposals into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. I’m not sure if there is the political will to execute these proposals, but I just wanted to point out that one solution is to break up big tech. Another example is nationalizing these companies. I think this is far from happening in the US, but we’ve done that in India to give historical examples. In the past, we’ve nationalized coal plants and all other sorts of things back in the 1960s and 70s. You do that because you recognize the value these companies bring, but you don’t want them to be purely profit-driven. So, you say we need an Amazon to fulfill people’s needs. We do need to have infrastructure to get people what they want. At the same time, such an enterprise shouldn’t be driven for profit. It should be driven to help people. I don’t think it will likely happen anytime soon, but I’m just saying we’ve had these two examples come up in the past. I think what’s more realistic is the kind of regulation that I was talking about back with the GDPR. For example, the GDPR limits what data the company can and cannot collect. Similarly, in Canada, a recent law was passed that said that if social media companies link out to news websites, they have to share some revenue with them. If adopted more broadly, I think these types of things have some positive impact. The other direction you can take, which is a lot less controversial, is transparency. One of the reasons these companies are dangerous is because we have very little transparency on how they make decisions. For example, who gets to be on these platforms or not? Even in front of AI companies, we don’t know, for instance, how people use Chat-GPT, whether they’re getting incorrect information, whether they’re using it for medical diagnosis or legal diagnosis, how often they’re getting incorrect advice and diagnoses, etc. Therefore, pushing for transparency is one of the things that is easier within our current political environment. I think this is something that at least I’m trying to push for through my research. Then there is the question of what is just and fair, right? I think proposals for transparency are easy. But even in the case of things like the facial recognition example from coded bias, I think their work led to the recognition that facial recognition can be biased and steps need to be taken to make it unbiased. And steps were taken in this direction. A couple of years after this seminal paper called Gender Shades was released, a lot of these companies improved their facial recognition algorithms. But the more fundamental question that this discourse raises is what facial recognition should be used for. Do we really want facial recognition, even if it’s fair and unbiased? Do we want this surveillance technology at all? So, for example, one of the most horrific uses of facial recognition in the last few years has been the tracking of the Uyghur Muslim population in China. And what that means is that you have essentially a surveillance state that’s enabled by this technology. And ironically, in order to be a successful surveillance state, you have to make it unbiased, right? It has to work well on China’s minority population for them to be tracked. So, all that is to say is that unbiased technology is not necessarily the technology that we actually want in the world. So, we need to think a bit more deeply about what is just in this scenario. Maybe the regulations we want are ones that ban facial recognition altogether, and over a dozen US municipalities have banned face recognition tools within them, including some prominent ones like San Francisco, if I’m not mistaken. There has been a lot of focus on fairness and unbiasedness in AI, and I think that’s a good stepping stone towards the deeper discussion that we need to have, which is what is just in all of these cases. I think we have to be open to the possibility that, in a lot of cases, the answer is that we shouldn’t be building these technologies at all. I think that regulation can help by banning certain uses of specific technologies",

      "AI is very hyped up in the modern era, like everyone just wants to know everything about it or some people might even want to pretend they know everything about it. If someone wants to start from scratch in this field and really understand the concepts, what would you suggest should be a roadmap for such a person?",
      "If this person is at IITK, I think that’s the perfect place. There are so many experts there. The professors, the graduate students, and the postdocs are all doing excellent research. I think you are privileged because you can work with these professors, reach out to them, take their courses, and so on. And regarding the hype around AI, some of it is also on researchers, but I think the companies’ marketing teams spread a lot of it. Keeping a critical eye on all these claims by companies is important. But like I said, our research found that even researchers fall prey to these things. Pitfalls in machine learning are very easy to make, and it’s very easy to fool yourself that, you know, your model is very good at something when, actually, it isn’t. And so that’s that’s one thing: being critical and engaging with the real experts and not the PR people. Another is to start from the basics in some sense. In recent years, we’ve seen this huge push for foundation models in natural language processing research. Foundation models are huge models that you can usually access through an API, and as a result, you don’t have any experience building these things; you use them as black boxes. GPT-4 is one example. Using these as building blocks can be great if you’re interested in web development or software development. But suppose you do want to work on machine learning and understand it truly. In that case, you have to avoid relying on these fancy pre-made consumer products and really understand how these models work from scratch rather than relying on technology already out there. I should also say that, in some sense, if more academia starts relying on these commercial models, we’re giving away some of the power that academia has in opposing the forces of industry. For example, especially in the US, academia is becoming increasingly reliant on industry funding, industry computing resources, etc. Therefore, you cannot really have a critical eye towards company-funded research. If a company funds you, it’s very hard to call out something wrong that’s happening with their products or counter some misleading claims by that company. As a result, the countervailing force that academia can offer is critical research, and for that, one has to start with a deep understanding of these tools and what they can and cannot do in the first place rather than relying on claims by profit-driven companies,",
      "",
      "Circling around this topic of private funded research, research is increasingly dependent upon funding from private companies and profit-driven corporations. Do you feel this can be combated and should the government spend more on research in public universities, especially in India?",
      "One thing to note is that IITs get a disproportionate amount of the research funding that’s available in India. Something more than 80 or 90 percent of the higher education funding is spent on 1% of the people pursuing higher education. As a result, the extreme resource inequality between IITs and other institutions is one thing to remember when discussing more funding for IITs. I think the trap here is that IITs, or any institution, need funding like that of Princeton and Yale to be successful research institutions. It’s true that more resources do help, but the scarcity or restriction on resources is also an enabler of creativity. Many things that we want and need to build, especially at IIT, need to work in the presence of low-resource regions. So, we don’t want to make advances that work only if you have a cluster of ten thousand Nvidia GPUs. Instead, we want technology that can work at the scale of computer resources that are available to the people of India or the customers of India. This type of research is actually not being pursued by most mainstream labs. And so, I think that this requires a shift in the mindset. Rather than competing with Princeton for the tag of, say, the biggest GPU supercomputer, we should go back and ask what this research is even for. Are we just mindlessly fighting an arms race, in which case we will lose, or are we trying to research to help the community that we want to serve? And who is that community? Is that community an international group of researchers, or is that community something more local? For example, one question that I would like to ask all IITK professors is: how many of you have interacted with the people in Kanpur? How many of you have gone to Nankari? How many of you have any real, meaningful relationships with people living, like, 500 meters from your house? And I think the answer would be that almost none of them have met anyone apart from perhaps the people who work for them or other people who are working at IITK. And so the very real question is that we can complain about the lack of funding that the government is giving at the end of the day to IITK professors and IIT professors in general. Still, they form a highly elite social class in India and Kanpur. Thus, we must ask what this elite social class is doing with this funding, which justifies that this funding should be diverted to them and not anyone else below them in the country’s social hierarchy.",

To a student who is studying in the first or second year who wants to pursue this dream, what would you suggest for them?",
      "I think the practical suggestion is just to hound potential professors and try to work on research problems as soon as you can in your career as much as you can if that is what you want. I would also not underestimate the value of having some financial independence. I know that is a massive thing for a lot of people. Academia is often portrayed as this fantastic place where you can do whatever you want. But at the end of the day, you still have to pay your rent and buy groceries, right? So, I think it is completely legitimate to make trade-offs that favor your financial life. I think there is some element of shaming people into pursuing research, like, “Oh, if you’re not doing academia, you’re not pure enough for research”. Some academics are prone to falling into this trap mostly because people like to think that they know best what they’re doing. But I think it’s important to remember that at the end of the day, academia is also just a job. So if it is one that you want, I think that’s great, and you know, pursue research by trying to publish papers and maybe work for a couple of years before joining academia. But if it isn’t something you like, there shouldn’t be any social pressure on people to think of research as “purer” than working in the industry. At the end of the day, both of them are just jobs.",

      "After you finish your Ph.D. do you plan to get back into industry? There are a lot of roles at places like Google Brain and OpenAI etc.- research but in a corporate setting. So would that be like where you would like to go eventually? Because in some ways those places, even though they have lesser freedom, they have slightly more impact because it is driven for real-world applications, at least more than what a purely academic setting would do",
      "Yeah, I think that is a hard question to answer. I definitely want to continue doing research. At the same time, a lot of my research has been critical of big tech like OpenAI, Google, and so on. So, I’m not sure if big tech companies can ever afford that level of freedom. So, even if it is research, I think it’ll end up either in academia or like smaller companies outside academia. But of course, you can never predict the future. Every two years, I’ve changed my plan on what I want to do, and I expect that will continue to happen for the time being. So it’s very hard to predict.",

      "The sight of tossed dustbins, scattered waste, and torn sanitary pads has become all too familiar for campus residents. Dogs have been found on various floors of residential halls in search of food. Incidents of destroyed belongings, including bitten shoes and damaged clothing, are rising. Some areas have witnessed aggressive dogs chasing campus residents, leading to injuries or dog bites. Some students have further mentioned how this affected their academics. Additionally, the incessant barking of dogs has become a source of significant nuisance. These dog behaviours can be observed in different pockets of the campus.",
      "",
      "The history of the relationship between humans and animals spans a broad spectrum, from companionship to parasitism. Often when we think about animals and companionship, dogs come first to mind. However, the issue of stray dogs is a global concern, and our campus is no exception. This article focuses on the coexistence of two different categories of living beings.  Vox delves into this complex issue in this investigative report, speaking with students, administration, and key stakeholders.",
      "",
      "The campus community can be broadly categorised into three groups based on their opinion on the issue, as observed by our team. The first includes people who have a soft spot for dogs. They oppose the removal of dogs from hall premises and propose alternative solutions, such as creating designated feeding zones, installing gates on staircases, individual adoption of dogs, protective cover and lifting of the waste bins, and conducting sensitisation campaigns within the campus community. They also encourage methods, like spraying water, to discourage dogs from specific areas. Some individuals actively volunteer to care for the dogs, monitoring their behaviour and promoting awareness through posters and educational campaigns. They further help with the smooth conduction of the sterilisation drive, as they act as a trusted entity for the dogs.",

      "The second group believes that removing dogs from residential areas is essential, as their presence disrupts routine activities and raises concerns about safety, hygiene and comfort. According to one HEC member, many residents fear the dogs, who sometimes enter rooms and create a mess. The constant littering also places additional burdens on sanitation efforts, and some halls have taken decisive action to remove dogs from the premises to mitigate these issues.",

      "The third group is the indifferent people. They do not hold strong opinions or are open to the suggested remedies. However, recent dog-related incidents have prompted many to reconsider their stance.

According to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960, under section 38 of theAnimal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules 2001,dogs cannot be removed or relocated from their territory(Q11 in the doc).

Established on December 31, 2018, the Animal Welfare Cell is tasked with enforcing the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals Act (PCA Act 1960). It collaborates with local authorities to protect animal rights and conducts sensitisation drives to maintain a balanced animal population within the campus, along with healthy cohabitation between humans and animals.",
      "The core members are a Chairperson, faculty advisors, local animal officers, and student nominees. Apart from them, the AWC also relies on its dedicated volunteers. These volunteers work diligently to minimise any harm caused by animal aggression or human interaction. They belong to the first school of thought, as mentioned above.",
      "During the two-year lockdown, sterilisation efforts within the campus were halted due to the absence of residents on campus, leading to a tremendous increase in the dog population. Despite a defunct period post-COVID, AWC has gotten active again recently in the current tenure.  It has resumed sterilisation efforts and is planning and organising sensitisation talks, the first of which took place on the 9th of October, 2023. Prof. Amit Mitra, the Chairperson of AWC, acknowledges the critical role of students in successful sterilisation drives.",

      "",
      "She also spoke about the aggressive behaviour of male dogs during the mating season and of female dogs when they have small pups, the role of male dogs in their upbringing, and the appropriate age for dogs to be adopted. She also explained how barking is the mark of reinforcing their territory.",
      "",
      "On the feeding habits of dogs, she said that dogs are scavengers by nature, and they eat what they get, be it through begging or rummaging in the dustbins. Dogs pick a resting site based on closeness to the food source, visibility (for security), and direct view of the feeding site. While creating the designated feeding sites, the two most essential things to be considered are the dog’s territory and the distance from the resting site. Excessive petting and feeding would lead the dogs to enter the residential premises, and she recommends avoiding these in the area used by the people to reside. It is also important not to over-feed the dogs at these sites, as excess resources breed competition and conflict. There are further mentions that the dogs will have to naturally shift to that “better” territory instead of forceful eviction, which might lead to increased aggression.",
      "",
      "She later tells us the importance of sterilisation to strike a balance so that the population doesn’t die out, ending the talk by stating that “dogs have survived not because of dog lovers or haters, but because of neutral people.” She repeatedly emphasised that coexistence is mandatory and that both parties need adjustments to cohabitate. She further explains how adjustment doesn’t mean sharing your residential space but acknowledging that the land we share belongs to the dogs equally as it does to the humans.",
      "",
      "Beyond dogs, the campus is also home to a significant population of peacocks. Concerns have arisen that dogs may be hunting peacocks, leading to declining numbers. Eight such cases were reported between January 1st and June 9th, 2023, as reported by the SIS office. This suspicion is not new; in 2018, a similar decline in peacock numbers prompted speculation about dogs killing them. At that time, the decision was made to move dogs to two feeding zones, but subsequent research revealed the presence of the Newcastle Virus in the peacocks, which led to the death.",
      "",
      "In conclusion, the issue of aggressive dogs on campus is a multifaceted challenge that has gathered diverse opinions among the student body and administration. It raises concerns about safety, hygiene, and coexistence. As we’ve explored, some advocate for the rights of dogs and demand a healthy coexistence, while others emphasise the need to remove dogs to address their problems. The middle ground remains elusive, and the lines often blur between these stances. Legalities, campus sentiment, and the role of the Animal Welfare Cell all play a pivotal role in shaping the ongoing dialogue on this issue. Finding a balanced and sustainable solution that ensures both the welfare of dogs and the well-being of the campus community is undoubtedly a complex task. As discussions continue, it is clear that fostering understanding, cooperation, and empathy among all stakeholders will be essential to resolving this challenging situation.",

      "The IITK community is diverse in terms of language origins. When speakers of varied languages interact, we often experience a barrier to open and free communication. First day of orientation and not understanding what the SGs just blabbered in Hindi. First day of classes, understanding the professor’s English was a bigger hurdle than understanding the course itself. We at Vox, tried to analyze theselanguage barrierson campus within the academic and co-curricular spheres. Read ahead to see what we found.",
      "343 students responded to our survey concerning the language barriers on campus conducted in July 2023. The following infographics depict their language backgrounds and the language they used to complete their board examinations. We see that this gives us the context required. A majority is comfortable with Hindi and English, but what about the students who do not fall into this category? What is being done? Is that sufficient and helpful? What more can be done by the various stakeholders? These are a few questions that we’ve tried to get answers to through this article.",
      "While a majority is fully to fairly comfortable, almost 10% of the students are not comfortable with English, the official medium of instruction in the institute. We further see that 19.8% of the respondents cannot interact with professors, and 9.3% face difficulty understanding lectures because of their inability to communicate confidently in English. These numbers are not mere stats, but represent a harsh reality. With a difficult curriculum like ours, such barriers can make learning almost impossible, and difficult for students to keep up with their peers.",
      "On talking to various professors, we found something similar. Some professors mention that during courses, some students either approach them with difficulty following the course content because it is in English or with a general problem in speaking and understanding English, which could lead to them feeling inferior in their peer groups. The professors, especially those taking English courses(like ELC and ENG), are supportive and suggest movies and books to the students. Some professors also told us that a few of them, especially the ones teaching English courses, suggest movies and books to better cope with English.",
      "Various respondents mention that they fear participating in academic discussions because they lack the confidence to word their thoughts in English. The institute introduced the English Language Courses (ELC 111/112/113) for Y22s in lieu of the previous ENG 112 and COM200 courses aimed at improving proficiency and communication skills in English. However, the effectiveness of these courses is put into question as 57.2% of the respondents (166) who took ELC/ENG courses believe it to be of little or no help in improving their proficiency with the language. Moreover, many mention that the ELC course allotted to them through the English Diagnostic Test, especially ELC113(Advanced), was a surprise because their English is not up to the standard. Even for the COM200 courses, an astounding 72.09% of the respondents(157) who took the course opted for the option “it was a complete waste of my time.”",
      "A few professors agree that there is a limitation of how much of a difference an English course in the curriculum can make for a student. They believe that support from the student community can have a more significant impact. One more observation they pointed out was that the ELC courses (formerly ENG112) offered to help students struggling with English run parallel with the rest of the courses. This is extremely tough on students with a poor grasp of English. They are now expected to comprehend the content and present answers in college-level English in other courses while simultaneously learning the language basics. By the time they get a good grasp on English, most of their semester is already done and dusted, placing them at a disadvantage academically.",
      "The dearth of a suitable environment to practice English is also part of the problem, as many respondents mention in their individual experiences. Ironically, some cite that the TAs and tutors usually stick to Hindi while instructing, unfurling issues for the section of the student community uncomfortable with Hindi.",
      "When asked whether the introduction of courses in regional languages would be beneficial, some professors mentioned that the struggle to work with English is one that cannot be avoided. English is the language of the world today, and in their professional life, students will have to work with it. By taking the lectures in Hindi or mixing Hindi and English, some professors feel that they are not only compromising the institution’s standard of teaching but also delaying the students’ struggle, which they have to face eventually.",
      "Another vital aspect affected by these language barriers is the social life of students. 16% of the respondents mentioned that they couldn’t participate in various club activities because of this, while another 18.1% faced difficulty in even making friends. This results in a barrier to understanding and speaking both Hindi and English fluently.",
      "15.5% of the respondents have little to no comfort with the Hindi language. The inability to interact fluently in Hindi unfurls another set of issues. A common problem mentioned by the respondents is that the mess workers, maintenance staff, etc., speak only in Hindi. Several also said they have difficulty interacting with new people and participating in campus activities as they are usually conducted in Hindi. Sharah PS, a Malayalam-speaking UG Y22, shares her experience of how she has to take a Hindi-fluent friend with her whenever she has to interact with shopkeepers. Even with some of her friends, it becomes difficult to converse as she can only reply in English. Adding on, she mentions that initially, some people were worse off than her and could have used some help. Another respondent mentions an incident where they went to inquire about a government scheme, and the official asked them to respond only in Hindi.“Even after explaining that we could not, the official told us to learn Hindi, bringing it up multiple times and joking about it.”",
      "Earlier, there were two ways in which students facing difficulties with English were given support. One was the formal help given, which consisted of courses, namely ENG112 and COM200. The other was the unofficial programs, including spoken English classes conducted by DoSA, TTC(Technical Terminology Classes), and ECC(English Communication Classes) conducted by the Institute Counseling Service (ICS).",
      "ENG112 was allocated to students based on their performance in the English Diagnostic Test conducted during the orientation. It was an extra course. Allotted students had to do it when the other students did their HSS Level 1 course. These students also had to do an HSS Level 1 course later. This led to a discrepancy in the student’s curriculum. Due to this, ENG112 was then made into an HSS Level 1 course. The curriculum for ENG112 was not fixed. It usually covered speaking, writing, listening, and reading, with the distribution varying from instructor to instructor. There was a COM200 course (till the Y21 batch), which all students had to take. There were various issues with that course, including the batch size being too big, diversity in proficiency among the students, and the time allotted for the course being insufficient to cover all the required aspects. There was also an issue of ownership of the course, with no department taking responsibility for offering the course for students who failed.",
      "In place of these courses, from the Y22 batch onwards, ELC111(Basic), ELC112(Intermediate), and ELC113(Advanced) have been introduced. Now, all students must take an English course in their first year. The level they have to take is determined by the English Diagnostic Test.However, the help that courses can provide is limited. This was recognized by the officials and the student body as the Institute Counseling service started offering TTC and ECC, and the DoSA started offering spoken English classes. These initiatives used to be of immense help to the students as they provided them with practical solutions. However, the spoken English classes by the DoSA stopped after the instructor who was taking the sessions left campus, and parallelly, the participation in the classes conducted by ICS decreased. Even the professors that we talked to noted this unwillingness of students to learn a new language. Some of them also suggested offering English courses before the start of the 1st semester, maybe in an extended orientation, so that students are better equipped to handle the other courses taught in English.",
      "Another aspect of communication courses prior to the introduction of the new UGARC was the department-level communication courses that aimed to teach students communication skills specific to their respective departments. For example, the Math department taught a course on presenting proofs, while the Electrical department’s communication course centered itself around resume-making, viva, and the likes. These department-level courses have also been discontinued with the Y22 batch, and the basket offered by ELC serves as a more comprehensive replacement. The efficacy of a new system/course is generally decided over 2-3 batches to eliminate special circumstances. Therefore, no significant change or impact of the courses can be looked at based on the feedback of a single batch.",
      "“However, while it is true that no system is by any means perfect, not all of its inefficacy falls on the administration. The efficacy of any system ultimately falls upon the people whom it serves to benefit, and ELC as a whole can only truly serve its purpose if the people who seek to improve their English communication skills truly participate and take its full benefit. Moreover, it is noteworthy that a higher-level ELC course can always be taken as an OE course by students who did a lower-level course previously and are interested in furthering their English communication skills,”said Kinshuk Siyol, student nominee to the Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC).",
      "Another mechanism available for students interested in working on their spoken/written English skills is offered by the Shivani Centre, which was set up in August 2021 with the aim of reintegratingHindi and other Indian Languages at IIT Kanpur.One of the objectives of Shivani Centre is to help fresher students who completed their schooling/JEE in Hindi adjust to a completely English academia. In addition, for students who are facing issues in interacting with their peers due to a lack of knowledge in Hindi, Shivani Centre offers spoken/written Hindi classes in varying proficiencies. For example, one can learn Hindi formally to the level of writing creative pieces or maybe just learn conversational Hindi to interact with their peers. Besides Hindi, the Shivani Centre also provides opportunities for students to learn other regional languages, such as Tamil, Kannada, or Malayalam.",
      "We also found that EPP, an English Proficiency Programme, used to be conducted for students who wanted to learn or improve their English. It was discontinued when the pandemic began. It was conceptualized and conducted by Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta with the help of some faculty members and the student body. The program helped diligent students write better English and perform better in the placement season, thus serving as a useful help for the student body.A group led by Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta is currently working towards reviving the program and is looking for volunteers to join the English team and the technical team,regarding which he will write to the students list shortly.",
      "In a nutshell, the language barriers on campus are real and affect students academically and socially. Despite continued efforts like the courses and support services, the barrier persists. Professors, student representatives, students seeking help, everyone agrees that there is a scope for improvement. Improvement here is not limited to the better resources and plans, but also in terms of a more enthusiastic participation by the students these efforts are for. As we see, it also calls for the need of the Campus Junta to be aware of such linguistic differences, and to deal with them empathetically. An attempt to understand and be more inclusive is required. These are not just numbers, but fellow students we see around us struggling. We are left to ponder about the smallest of attempts we can make for the betterment of the situation.",

      "आई आई टी कानपुर एक ऐसा शिक्षण संस्थान है जहां पर भाषागत विविधता आमतौर पर देखी जा सकती है।जब विभिन्न भाषाओं को बोलने वाले वक्ता बातचीत करते हैं, तब अक्सर वह खुले और मुक्त संचार में बाधा का अनुभव करते हैं। पहले दिन जब SGs हिंदी में कुछ बताते है या संवाद करते हैं और जब प्रोफेसर की अंग्रेजी समझना पाठ्यक्रम को समझने से भी बड़ी बाधा होती है। विस्तृत रूप से जानने के लिए हमारी VOX टीम ने शैक्षणिक और सह-पाठ्यचर्या क्षेत्रों के भीतर कैंपस में इन भाषा बाधाओं का विश्लेषण करने का प्रयास किया। हमें क्या मिला यह देखने के लिए आगे पढ़ें।",
      "परिसर में भाषा संबंधी बाधाओं से संबंधित हमारे सर्वेक्षण ( जो जुलाई 2023 में किया गया था ) में 343 छात्रों ने प्रतिक्रिया दी। निम्नलिखित इन्फोग्राफिक्स उनकी भाषा पृष्ठभूमि और उस भाषा को दर्शाते हैं जिसका उपयोग उन्होंने अपनी बोर्ड परीक्षाओं को पूरा करने के लिए किया था। इससे हमें उत्तरदाताओं की भाषा पृष्ठभूमि के बारे में कुछ जानकारी मिलती है और बाद के विश्लेषण के लिए भी जगह मिलती है। अधिकांश लोग हिंदी और अंग्रेजी में सहज हैं, लेकिन उन छात्रों के बारे में क्या जो इस श्रेणी में नहीं आते हैं? उनके लिए क्या प्रयास किए गए हैं? क्या यह पर्याप्त और सहायक है? इन समस्याओं से निजात पाने के लिए और क्या प्रयास किए जा सकते हैं? ये कुछ प्रश्न हैं जिनका उत्तर हमने इस लेख के माध्यम से पाने का प्रयास किया है।",
      "किये गए सर्वे के अनुसार विद्यार्थियों में भाषा को लेकर एक विभाजन निश्चित तौर पर देखा जा सकता है। ज्यादातर छात्रों को तो कोई खास दिक्कत नहीं है पर लगभग 10% छात्रों को अंग्रेजी के प्रयोग से दिक्कत है, जो इंस्टिट्यूट की औपचारिक भाषा है। अंग्रेजी में आत्मविश्वास से संवाद करने में उनकी असमर्थता के कारण, जिन्होंने सर्वे फॉर्म भरा था उनमें से लगभग 19.8% विद्यार्थी प्रोफेसर से बात करने में हिचकिचाते हैं और लगभग 9.3% विद्यार्थी लेक्चर समझने में मुश्किल महसूस करते हैं। ये आंकड़े महज़ आँकड़े नहीं हैं, बल्कि एक कड़वी हकीकत बयाँ करते हैं। हमारे जैसे कठिन पाठ्यक्रम के साथ, ऐसी बाधाएं सीखने को लगभग असंभव बना सकती हैं, और छात्रों के लिए अपने साथियों के साथ तालमेल बिठाना मुश्किल हो सकता है।",
      "अलग अलग प्रोफेसर्स से बात करने पर भी एक ही तरह की प्रतिक्रिया हमारे सामने आई। कुछ प्रोफेसर्स ने बताया की कुछ बच्चे हैं जो उनके पास अपनी परेशानी लेकर आये और उनको बताया कि उन्हे पाठ्यक्रम सामग्री को समझने में दिक्कत होती है क्योंकि वह अंग्रेजी में है और उनको अंग्रेजी बोलने और समझने में परेशानी होती है। जिसके कारण वह अपने आप को अपने साथियों से कमजोर महसूस करते हैं। प्रोफेसर्स जो अंग्रेजी कोर्सेज लेते हैं (जैसे कि  ELC और ENG)  काफी सहायक है। वे छात्रों को फ़िल्में और किताबें बताते हैं जो उन्हें बेहतर ढंग से अंग्रेजी समझने में सहायक होते हैं।",
      "कुछ विद्यार्थियों ने यह भी बताया कि अंग्रेजी में आत्मविश्वास न होने के कारण वे अकादमिक चर्चाओं में भाग लेने से भी कतराते हैं। संस्था ने ENG112 और COM200 के जगह पर Y22s के लिए English Language Course(ELC 111/112/113) को आरंभ किया था जिसकी प्रभावशीलता को लगभग 57.2% विद्यार्थियों ने अंग्रेजी सुधारने में अक्षम बताया है। ELC course सभी को English Diagnostic Test के माध्यम से बांटा जाता है। ELC113(Advanced) पाने वाले कुछ विद्यार्थियों ने आश्चर्य जताया है क्योंकि उनकी अंग्रेजी अच्छी न होने पर भी उन्हें ये कोर्स मिला है। COM200 लेने वाले विद्यार्थियों में से 72.09% (157) ने इस कोर्स को “समय की बर्बादी” बताया था।",
      "कुछ प्रोफेसर इस बात से सहमत हैं कि पाठ्यक्रम में एक अंग्रेजी पाठ्यक्रम, एक छात्र के लिए कितना अंतर ला सकता है, इसकी एक सीमा है। उनका मानना है कि छात्र समुदाय के भीतर से मिलने वाले समर्थन का अधिक प्रभाव हो सकता है। एक और अवलोकन जो उन्होंने बताया वह यह था कि ELC पाठ्यक्रम (पूर्व में ENG112) अंग्रेजी से जूझ रहे छात्रों को बाकी पाठ्यक्रमों के समानांतर चलने में मदद करने की कोशिश करते हैं। पर जो छात्र अंग्रेजी में कमजोर है और नई भाषा को सीख रहे हैं उनके लिए कॉलेज द्वारा पाठ्य सामग्री को अंग्रेजी में पढ़ना और अपने उत्तर को अंग्रेजी में प्रस्तुत करना कुछ हद तक कठिन हो जाता है। जब तक वे अंग्रेजी पर अच्छी पकड़ बनाते हैं, तब तक उनका अधिकांश सेमेस्टर समाप्त हो चुका होता है और वे शैक्षणिक रूप से नुकसान में रहते हैं।",
      "अंग्रेजी का अभ्यास करने के लिए उपयुक्त वातावरण की कमी भी समस्या का एक हिस्सा है, जैसा कि कई उत्तरदाताओं ने अपने व्यक्तिगत अनुभवों में उल्लेख किया है।यहां तक, कुछ ने तो ये भी बताया कि अक्सर TA और Tutors बात-चीत में हिंदी का प्रयोग करते थे जो कि उन विद्यार्थियों के लिए एक बाधा थी जिन्हें हिंदी नहीं आती थी।",
      "जब उनसे पूछा गया कि क्या क्षेत्रीय भाषाओं में पाठ्यक्रम शुरू करने से फायदा होगा? तबकुछ प्रोफेसर्स ने यह भी वर्णित किया कि अंग्रेजी में काम करने का संघर्ष ऐसा है जिसे टालना नामुमकिन हैं, क्योंकि अंग्रेजी आज दुनिया की भाषा है, और अपने व्यवस्यायी जीवन में विद्यार्थियों को इस भाषा के साथ काम करना होगा। हिंदी में लेक्चर लेने या हिंदी और अंग्रेजी को सयोंजकर लेक्चर लेने मे कुछ प्रोफेसरों को लगता है कि वे न केवल संस्थान के शिक्षण के स्तर से समझौता करेंगे, बल्कि वे छात्रों के उस संघर्ष में भी विलंब ला रहे हैं जिसका सामना उन्हें अंततः करना हैं।",
      "पढाई के अतिरिक्त, विद्यार्थियों को सामाजिक जीवन में भी भाषा रूपी बाधाओं का सामना करना पड़ता है। सर्वे में 16% बच्चों ने बताया कि इसके कारण उन्हें विभिन्न क्लब गतिविधियों में परेशानी का सामना करना पड़ता है व 18.1% को तो दोस्त बनाने में भी मुश्किल होती है।जिसका मुख्य कारण यह है कि हिंदी और अंग्रेजी दोनों को धाराप्रवाह समझने और बोलने में लोगों को समस्याओं का सामना करना पड़ता है।",
      "सर्वे में 15.5% उत्तरदाताओं ने हिंदी में असमर्थता व्यक्त की है। हिंदी में धाराप्रवाह बातचीत करने में असमर्थता कई अन्य समस्याओं को उजागर करती है। एक आम समस्या जो देखी गई है वो ये है कि mess workers और maintenance staff  सिर्फ हिंदी में ही बात करते हैं। कैंपस में होने वाली अधिकतर गतिविधियां भी हिंदी में ही होती हैं जिसके करण काफी लोग नए लोगों से बात करने में खुद को अक्षम पाते हैं। शाराह पी.एस., मलयालम बोलने वाली एक Y22 UG छात्रा ने बताया है कि कैसे उन्हें हर बार एक हिंदी में सहज मित्र को अपने साथ ले जाना पड़ता है ताकि वे दुकनदारों से बात कर सकें। यहां तक कि उन्हें अपने मित्रो से भी बात करने में मुश्किल होती है क्योंकि वे सिर्फ अंग्रेजी में ही उत्तर दे सकती हैं । एक उत्तरदाता ने तो ये भी बताया कि जब वे एक सरकारी योजना के बारे में जानने के लिए दफ्तर गए थे तो अधिकारी ने उन्हें सिर्फ हिंदी में ही बात करने के लिए कहा था।“यह समझाने के बाद भी कि हम हिंदी नहीं बोल सकते, अधिकारी ने हमें हिंदी सीखने के लिए कहा, कई बार इसका जिक्र किया और इसका मज़ाक उड़ाया।”",
      "पहले, अंग्रेजी में कमजोर छात्रों को दो माध्यमों से मदद दी जाती थी। एक तरीका तो औपचारिक था जिसमे सभी कोर्स आते हैं। ऑफर कियें जाने वाले कोर्स थे ENG112 और COM200। और दूसरा था अनौपचारिक तरीका जिसमे आती थी English Speaking Classes by DoSA, TTC(Technical Terminology Classes) और ECC(English Communication Classes) जो कि Institute Counselling Service(ICS) द्वारा आयोजित किया जाता था।",
      "ENG112 course EDT (English Diagnostic Test) के माध्यम से दिया जाता था जो की orientation के समय होता था। ये एक अधिक कोर्स था जिसे बच्चे तब करते थे जब बाकी बच्चे HSS Level 1 course करते थे लेकिन इसे HSS का नाम नहीं दिया गया था जिसके कारण बच्चों को एक अधिक कोर्स करना पड़ता था। इस वजह से बच्चों के curriculum में भी दिक्कत आती थी जिसके चलते बाद में ENG112 को भी HSS Level 1 Course बना दिया गया था, लेकिन इसके पाठ्यक्रम को फिर भी नहीं बदला गया था। Y21 बैच तक COM200 एक पाठ्यक्रम था जिसे लेना सभी विद्यार्थियों के लिए अनिवार्य था। इसमे भी कुछ खामिया थी जैसे पाठ्यक्रम में अत्याधिक विद्यार्थियों का होना, बच्चों में भाषा की विविधता का होना तथा पाठ्यक्रम में दिए गए समय का अपर्याप्त होना। चूंकि ये कोर्स कोई विशेष विभाग तो लेता नहीं था इसलिए असफल होने वाले विद्यार्थियों को कई मुश्किलों का सामना करना पडता था।",
      "इसकी जगह पर Y22 batch के लिए ELC111(Basic), ELC112(Intermediate) और ELC113(Advanced) course को लाया गया था। अब सभी विद्यार्थियों के लिए प्रथम वर्ष में एक अंग्रेजी का कोर्स लेना अनिवार्य है जिसका फैसला EDT से होगा। कोर्स केवल कुछ हद तक ही बच्चों को मदद कर सकता है। इस खामी को ICS ने पहचाना और TTC aur ECC प्रदान करना शुरू किया था। DoSA ने भी इंग्लिश स्पीकिंग क्लास लेना शुरू किया था। सभी की ये पहल बच्चों के लिए काफ़ी मददगार साबित हुई थी। लेकिन वे इंस्ट्रक्टर जो इंग्लिश स्पीकिंग क्लास लेते थे, उनके कैंपस छोड़ते ही ये क्लास भी बंद हो गई और उधर ICS की क्लासेस में भी विद्यार्थियों की संख्या गिरती चली गई।यहां तक ​​कि जिन प्रोफेसर्स से हमने बात की, उन्होंने भी छात्रों की नई भाषा सीखने की अनिच्छा पर ध्यान दिया।कुछ प्रोफेसरों ने पहले सेमेस्टर की शुरुआत से पहले अंग्रेजी पाठ्यक्रमों की पेशकश करने का सुझाव दिया।  शायद एक विस्तारित ओरिएंटेशन, जिससे छात्र अंग्रेजी में पढ़ाए जाने वाले अन्य पाठ्यक्रमों को संभालने के लिए बेहतर ढंग से सुसज्जित हो सकें।",
      "नये UGARC के आने से पहले सभी विभाग communication पाठ्यक्रम प्रदान करते थे जिसका मुख्य उद्देश्य बच्चों में संचार कौशल विकसित करना होता था। उदाहरणानुसार गणित विभाग के प्रोफेसर छात्रों को प्रूफ़ लिखना सिखाते थे तो वहीं इलेक्ट्रिकल विभाग के प्रोफेसर मुख्य तौर पर Resume लिखना सिखाते थे, जिसको Y22 से रोक दिया गया है। ये department-level communication courses को Y22 बैच के साथ बंद कर दिया गया एवं  ELC को इसका एक बेहतर रिपलेसमेंट के रूप में देखा जाने लगा। किसी भी कोर्स की कमियों को 2-3 बैच की समीक्षा के आधार पर दूर किया जाता है। अभी सिर्फ Y22 की प्रतिक्रिया पर कोर्स में कोई बदलाव नहीं किया जा सकता है।",
      "“हालांकि, यह सच है कि कोई भी प्रणाली किसी भी तरह से परिपूर्ण नहीं है, लेकिन इसकी सारी अक्षमता प्रशासन पर नहीं पड़ती है। किसी भी प्रणाली की प्रभावकारिता अंततः उन लोगों पर निर्भर करती है जिन्हें वह लाभान्वित करती है, और हर प्रकार से ELC केवल तभी वास्तव में अपने उद्देश्य को पूरा कर सकता है यदि जो लोग सच में अपने अंग्रेजी संचार कौशल में सुधार करना चाहते हैं वे वास्तव में भाग लेते हैं और इसका पूरा लाभ उठाते हैं। इसके अलावा, यह उल्लेखनीय है कि एक उच्च-स्तरीय ELC पाठ्यक्रम को हमेशा उन छात्रों द्वारा OE पाठ्यक्रम के रूप में लिया जा सकता है, जिन्होंने पहले निम्न-स्तरीय पाठ्यक्रम किया था और अपने अंग्रेजी संचार कौशल को आगे बढ़ाने में रुचि रखते हैं ”– किंशुक सियोल,Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC) के student nominee.",
      "शिवानी सेंटर, जिसकी स्थापना अगस्त 2021 में हुई थी, एक और माध्यम है जिसकी स्थापना आई आई टी कानपुर में हिंदी और अन्य भारतीय भाषाओं को फिर से शामिल करने के उद्देश्य से हुई थी। शिवानी सेंटर का मुख्य उद्देश्य उन नए छात्रों की मदद करना है, जिन्होंने अपनी स्कूली शिक्षा और जेईई यात्रा हिंदी में पूरी की है और उन्हें पूरी तरह से अंग्रेजी शिक्षा में समायोजित किया जा सके। जिन बच्चों को हिंदी ना आने की वजह से दोस्तों से बात करने में दिक्कत होती है उनके लिए शिवानी सेंटर में हिंदी कक्षाएं भी प्रदान की जाती हैं। हिंदी के अलावा यहां क्षेत्रीय भाषाएँ जैसे तमिल, मलयालम या कन्नड़ भी सिखाई जाती है।",
      "EPP, एक अंग्रेजी दक्षता कार्यक्रम है जिसे उन लोगों के लिए एक पाठ्यक्रम की तरह अयोजित किया जाता था जो अंग्रेजी को सीखना और उसमें सुधार करना चाहते थे लेकिन कोरोना के चलते इसे बंद करना पड़ा था। इसके योजना के पीछे मुख्य रूप से प्रोफेसर भास्कर दासगुप्ता शामिल थे और उनके साथ और भी संकाय सदस्य और छात्र निकाय भी शामिल थे। इस प्रोग्राम ने छात्रों को प्लेसमेंट सीज़न में काफ़ी मदद की थी।प्रोफेसर भास्कर दासगुप्ता के नेतृत्व में एक समूह वर्तमान में कार्यक्रम को पुनर्जीवित करने की दिशा में काम कर रहा है और अंग्रेजी टीम और तकनीकी टीम में शामिल होने के लिए volunteers की तलाश कर रहा है, जिसके संबंध में वह शीघ्र ही studentlist पर लिखेंगे।",

      "Congratulations on finally being accepted into “The Indian Institute of Technology”! A word that takes about two and a half seconds to say loud and clear and the exact figure in years to get in. But fret not, because we’re here to give you a sneak peek into the rollercoaster ride that awaits you!",
      "",
      "Let’s talk about engineers, shall we? They come in two vibrant flavors. First, the dreamers who aspired to be at IITs, and second, the brave souls who just wanted CSE. And as is the law of the land, here also the minority has to suffer—all day, on chairs in an air-conditioned room, doing the most common stuff. In contrast, the majority have the time of their lives with shovels, trowels, and hammers amid strange and novel equipment. Many of them come here with bags full of hopes for branch change to CSE, which you intelligent people would have known by now is a nursery of cacti piercing through the bag of dreams.",
      "",
      "By now, you must have also discovered the fascinating Amma Bapu Culture at IITK. Some words of wisdom: This place is like a goldmine for “healthy” interactions with our beloved seniors. They’re like superheroes, always ready to lend a helping hand. And do not forget “Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it”.",
      "Oh, and hold on tight because the GBM (General Body Meeting) is just around the corner. The wise old folks want you to proudly represent your hall in the Fresher’s Inferno and the mighty General Championship. They’ll go on and on about the hall’s legacy, expecting you to carry the torch forward. But fear not; all you need is a boatload of enthusiasm to dive headfirst into these shenanigans. And yes, you would also get the moment of your life to bring out the rockstar hidden in you through the chanting of the Hall Anthem of the Mighty Halls.",
      "",
      "And Yes, how can I miss the “good life” of IITs, the thing for which you have come here. It’s time to relish it. Acknowledging that there is no collector to declare a rainy holiday, you would have learned to cycle through swamps, catching your attendance threshold. You would soon gain the extraordinary ability to go without a bath during the winter for longer than anyone thought possible. You’ll eagerly wait for the sun—not to get a tan, but for some hot water to end your long streak. Get ready to share your snacks, shoes, stationery, and your oh–not-so-precious personal space with your roomies. And let’s not forget those sadistic professors who seem to have a knack for giving out D grades. But amidst all these trials, there is something positive: the wifi works just fine!",
      "",
      "Now, I know you’re all in agreement about one thing that haunts your every waking moment: time management. You’ll find yourself silently nodding, realizing that you’ve become a multitasking procrastinator. You can put off all sorts of things simultaneously! No matter how overwhelmed you feel with academics and chores, you always find time for the most captivating activity of the day: scrolling through those “relatable” reels on Instagram. After all, it’s comforting to know that we’re all sailing in the same procrastination boat. But young ones, the promises of a luxurious life after clearing JEE are finally fulfilled because… the wifi works just fine!",
      "Freak not! There is actually a lot of really good stuff that IITK has to offer. From the freedom to roam through the campus at any time of the day to meeting people from different schools of thought, IITK will perhaps be the first place where you can choose your own path and your own destiny.",
      "",
      "Fitness is taken very seriously here, and IITK leaves no stone unturned to achieve this. A carefully curated workout plan to keep you at the best of your physical capabilities will require getting half the batch up at 6:30 in the morning and walking around the field once a week. But the best part about studying at IITK is that you chose this. You finally get to learn courses that you actually want to study. All those useless subjects you were forced to mug up in school are finally gone! No more history, no more geography, no more bio… oh wait!",
      "",
      "And, of course, there are those among you who have come for the brilliant professors and their brilliant courses, hoping to shape your brilliant minds. Well, IITK surely will not disappoint. The top-notch labs here are sure to teach you many things. Amidst the labyrinth of instruments and expensive equipment, you will learn to be observant and wait for someone to complete the experiment for you to copy.",
      "",
      "Academics, club competitions, hackathons, and so many other activities can be extremely draining, and they will consume your entire day. So a natural question that you might ask is, “When can I have fun? When can I relax?”. Well, “whenever you wish”.",
      "You are peacefully working towards your project submission in your room, and suddenly your wingies storm in! They are there to help, ahh nope, kido. They are just inviting you for a ‘GPL’! After a long day, you might decide to take a walk around the campus, and just on the path from Hall 13 to OAT, you find random people you’ve barely seen before but end up having the most nuanced discussion on how ducks are practically water chickens. This campus is always buzzing with countless opportunities to let loose and have the time of your life.",
      "",
      "Reading through all this ‘gyaan,’ your mind must be surging with many emotions. After all, so much information can be overwhelming, so here is the gist: You are away from home in a completely unfamiliar environment (and somehow it only gets crazier), but you are amidst family. After a few weeks, you’ll get more comfortable with this environment, form great connections, and inevitably fall in love with this campus. The only thing that you should remember is that you are not alone in this process. Feel free to share any problems you face, communicate openly with your friends and seniors, and most importantly, enjoy being anIITiannow.",

      "Attendance has long been a moot point of discussion amongst both Professors and Students. As the semester begins, a few FCHs manage to send shivers down one’s spine with their attendance policies. In an attempt to understand the views of Campus Junta, we at Vox Populi conducted a survey on the “Effect of Attending Classes and Attendance Policies” and simultaneously met a few professors to gather their opinions on this topic.",
      "What follows is a list of questions we compiled on the effect of Attendance policies, answered by various professors, along with the data we collected from our survey.",
      "From our survey of 457 respondents, 260 people claimed that they attend all or most of their classes; 108 people opined that they attend classes around quizzes and important topics; and 85 people said that they rarely attend classes.",
      "When we asked the professors about the attendance they usually see in class and whether it bothers them, Prof. P.S. Ghoshdastidar stated that he usually sees low attendance after mid-semester exams since “students become very complacent because they are assured of a decent grade after looking at their mid-semester performance.”",
      "Prof. Manindra says that attendance does bother him. He recalled teaching a class of 350 students in the previous semester and noted that he never saw more than 100 students attend the class. He attributes the fall in attendance to the post-pandemic scenario, where students have more access to online resources, which might have affected their motivation to attend physical classes.",
      "This sentiment is echoed in our survey as well, where 76 percent of respondents said they wouldn’t attend the class offline if the same lecture were available online.",
      "Among other factors deterring students from attending classes, early morning classes (opted by 314/421 people), very few classes or long intervals between classes on the same day (opted by 165 respondents) seemed to be the prominent factors.",
      "When we asked students to rate the importance of attendance on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all important and 5 being most important, out of 457 respondents, the majority gave it a rating of 3 (110 people) or 1 (111 people). Only 35% of respondents gave a score of 4 or above.",
      "On the other hand, all professors agree with the strong correlation between attending classes and students’ performance in courses. Prof. Ghoshdastidar states “The courses at IITK are uniquely structured, and the way content is presented is very different from any other platform. Therefore, even if a student misses a single class, they are definitely going to face some difficulty understanding the course, which is bound to affect their performance.” He also presents a correlation he could gather from his courses:“Most students who don’t attend classes regularly don’t even score enough to get a C; they mostly land with a D or an F.”",
      "Prof. Harbola further adds, “In my courses, at least, I make sure that it is essential for students to attend classes to perform well, and I structure them very differently from any other course available online. My motivation as a teacher is to ensure that tomorrow when a student meets a person from MIT, they look them in the eye and say, I learned better than you did.” He further elaborates on the importance of attendance and teacher-student interaction and makes it clear that attendance is bound to impact performance.",
      "When we questioned students on the correlation between attendance and performance, out of 447 respondents, 42% believed that attending lectures and tutorials helped them understand easily and kept them in sync with the professor. In contrast, 28% felt their performance was independent of attending lectures and tutorials.",
      "Upon closer examination, our survey pointed out that another major factor that decides whether or not one attends their classes largely depends on the attendance policy of that course, as 56% of students said that they go to classes only as per the attendance percentage required based on the grading policy.",
      "Professors hold great power in deciding what this policy would be, as unlike most colleges, there is no institute-wide attendance policy, and professors are free to determine how to incorporate attendance into their courses if they choose to implement it at all.",
      "Professor Arijit Kundu, who mandates 90% attendance in his course, says,“The Motto behind 90% attendance is just to push the students to wake up and come to class,”implying that the main reason behind enforcing a set percentage of attendance is to ensure consistency, especially considering the ample extracurricular activities here on campus.In the same context, in one of our previousarticles, Prof. Neeraj Misra states that“Some students may be capable of achieving good grades without regular attendance, but IITK is not a factory to provide grades. Here we inculcate an academic environment, and every student has certain responsibilities.” He further elaborates that attending classes is the fundamental academic responsibility of a student and is bound to impact their learning.",
      "Moreover, in certain courses, instructors assign a portion of the grades to attendance, leading to the question of how significant this practice is in influencing a student’s learning and overall academic performance. Professor Tapobrata Sarkar believes that “enforcing” attendance might not necessarily have a significant impact on a student’s learning or overall grades. Instead, he focuses on creating an enjoyable and engaging learning experience. He aims to impart knowledge that students can apply in their later lives. Similarly, Prof. Harbola shares the same view as Prof. Tapobatra .However, he conducts surprise quizzes in the tutorials.“We say continuous evaluation. I’ve changed it to continuous study. What is wrong with that?” ~Professor Harbola",
      "Nonetheless, professors have time and again tested and experimented with attendance policies. While some have stuck to the same policy from the very beginning of their careers, others have changed with the tide.",
      "Professor P.S. Ghoshdastidar mentions how, in the beginning, he didn’t enforce any attendance policy in his classes; however, now he has a certain weighting of attendance in the grading. He remarks, “I joined in July 1984, and until 2000, there were no complaints from any faculty member regarding students not attending classes. The attendance began to fall in the Y2K batches. I think this is due to easy access to the internet, and the students get the material online and don’t attend classes.”",
      "Prof. MK Harbola says he used to have an attendance policy for smaller classes but not for larger classes; however, later, he realized that his role was to teach and not enforce attendance on students. ”People are here to study; they don’t want to study. Why should I force them? That’s their problem. They are wasting their parent’s money.”",
      "Despite graded attendance and changes in the instructor’s policy, we see that there are some pertinent issues due to which students do not attend classes. According to our survey, the three leading causes are uninteresting teaching methods (275 respondents chose this ), difficulty in understanding the professor (222 respondents), and lack of interest in the course’s subject (142 respondents).",
      "As the final question in our questionnaire, we asked both the professors and students what their ideal attendance policy would be: Two main approaches were highlighted.1.Students are functional adults; it is their choice whether to come to class or not at the end of the day, and professors would rather not spend resources policing them. They also believe that forcing attendance does not change the student’s intent to learn, which is the real problem.At the same time, both students and professors recognize that, in many cases, the lectures do not seem engaging enough to the student. Motivation drops, and attendance follows. Prof. Tapobrata Sarkar mentions that he overcame the issue of engagement in class by having an open discussion with his students about their teaching needs. He does not follow a compulsory attendance policy.2. Incentive:Many professors set an attendance requirement to urge students to make the extra effort to remain in touch with the course. For example, Prof. Arijit Kundu acknowledges the variety of activities on campus. This is why he says he sets attendance criteria for UGs (“especially first-years”) so that they have an incentive to learn throughout the semester as opposed to cramming before exams.",
      "Where,",
      "Attendance as a binary rule for passing the class: You must attend a set percentage of classes to be eligible for giving major exams and passing the course",
      "Attendance as a graded entity: Attending each class gives you a certain percentage of marks",
      "Attendance as a binary graded entity: Attending a minimum number of classes would make you eligible for extra marks",
      "The scaling of grades according to attendance: Attendance serves as multiplying factor to your course total",
      "Among students, we also see a divided opinion. While 49.7% of the students do not want any attendance policy, 43% of the students do want attendance to hold weightage",
      "To conclude, IITK’s unique position in providing freedom to professors to set their attendance policies has thrown up some interesting policies.Education has long been an evolving landscape, and this continued evolution necessitates thoroughly examining these policies, largely driven by the insights derived from the professors’ perspectives. To quote Professor Manindra Agarwal, “It is clear that we will have to experiment with different methods of teaching as the traditional methods of teaching don’t seem to work anymore. We’ll have to try and find out what is working right.”",

      "The nuclear reactors run by the Department of Atomic Energy satisfy two critical needs of our nation – nuclear energy and strategic usage. The reactor safety is analyzed by doing a scenario assessment because one cannot simulate the experimental settings in a laboratory. Regardless, we must know about the mishaps and potential damage. The idea of a nuclear energy program is to have all safety nets in place, and how to assess it is by running the safety course. The problem faced is that they can create their code to determine the safety of their reactors, but that requires validation of the code using experimental settings. The National Aerosol Facility was set up to analyze the safety of the reactors.",
      "After joining IIT Kanpur in 2003, Professor S. N. Tripathi, who had previously worked at BARC, launched the National Aerosol Facility. The facility was supposed to be built in 2018–19, but the pandemic caused the construction to be put off by more than two years. Most components and equipment are designed by BARC scientists and experts at IIT Kanpur and are indigenously made. There are around 7-8 such facilities globally, with this being the first in South Asia. Since its inception, four experiments have been conducted, collaborating with over ten scientists.",
      "Post independence, advancement in industrialization led to a desperate need for energy, and Nuclear Energy was viable. Since India didn’t sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, other nuclear countries were not ready to provide technologies to India. In 1998, after the nuclear test in India, the situation worsened due to sanctions imposed by the USA. There was a way – to transfer knowledge in this field via educational institutes, and IIT Kanpur was one such institute.",
      "The facility encompasses two groups, one works on reactor safety (Reactor Safety Division) and the other on radiation protection (Radiological Physics & Advisory Division). There’s an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to review the safety parameters.Half of the funding for the facility comes from the institute, and the other half comes from BARC and BRNS in equal amounts. The total funding sums up to about 20 crores.",
      "When an accident occurs in a nuclear power plant, radioactive material is released into the environment and deposited inside the power plant, which may escape into the environment. This material can be in the form of aerosols. The NAF experiments study the behavior (size, growth, properties, etc.) of such radioactive aerosols and the amount of aerosol being deposited and resuspended. The goal is also to create a database from the experiments done here and use these databases to validate the accidental nuclear codes",
      "Two plasma torches in the facility are used to generate plasma. Argon is used as it isn’t expensive like helium or flammable like hydrogen. It is mixed with nitrogen to increase its enthalpy.",
      "Argon or nitrogen is also used as the carrier gas to ensure that the plasma flame doesn’t extinguish. The powder feeder directly feeds Zinc and Tin powder to the plasma flame. Upon reaching the flame, the metal powder vaporizes and goes on ahead to condense into small particles. More vapor gets deposited on the smaller particles to become bigger particles. The particle size increases as more vapor gets deposited on the smaller particles, or the particles coagulate.",
      "And thus, aerosols are generated from Zinc or Tin metal powder. As the metal vaporizes, the aerosols react with oxygen and forms zinc oxide or tin oxide.",
      "Air for a compressor can be used along with Helium or Argon as a carrier gas. The mixing vessel ensures that the generated aerosol gets the proper time and space to reach the required concentration and ensures a stabilized flow of the aerosols. The two plasma torches are beneficial as they make it possible to generate a very high concentration of aerosols or to check for a mixture of two different aerosols.",
      "The centerline temperature of the plasma flame is almost 10000C. Water circulation reduces this temperature, ensuring the flame-generating electrodes do not melt.",
      "A high voltage is supplied to the gas, creating a vast electric potential, thereby ionizing the gas, and generating plasma. Initially, the frequency is kept high and alternating to create a spark that produces plasma. It is later shifted to DC, and the plasma keeps generating.There are two different pipe sections for the supply of different gases. Pressure and flow control valves are present for each pipe to control the pressure and flow of the gases.",
      "The design pressure for the facility is 10 bar, and some components can sustain forces up to 16 bar. However, still, it is preferred to stay within the operating pressure of 5 bar. A thermal mass flow meter and vortex flow meter are used to measure the mass flow rates of the gases and steams.",
      "The facility has a boiler to observe the interaction of the aerosol particles with steam since steam is also present in the environment with other gases whenever an accident occurs in a nuclear power plant. Due to its interaction with aerosol, the steam condenses to water, which can be problematic as it can create hydrogen and leads to explosions.",
      "Two heaters (air pre-heater and air superheater) are installed to mimic the high-temperature scenarios in which accidents occur. After passing through these heaters, the components are mixed in the mixing vessel, and then they go ahead. That panel is the heat control panel.",
      "The central core contains nuclear fuels; during accidents, melting occurs (called corium), and the temperature crosses 2000C.Mineral wool is used for insulation to avoid heat loss. This mineral wool is protected by using an aluminum sheet over it.",
      "After evaluating the critical parameters, the aerosol-laden gases enter the scrubber tank filtration unit. The aerosols are filtered in this unit, and the clean gases, without any particles, move ahead. The scrubber tank has an inbuilt mechanism to maintain its water level automatically. The pressure is maintained inside the scrubber tank using Pressure Vacuum Relief Valve. The clean gases then go to the collection chamber to remove the moisture, which is vented through the vent pipe.",
      "The piping system can be cleaned using high-pressure water through the water inlet port. The water and impurities are then allowed into the drain through the drainage system.The PDPA instrument uses four laser beams to measure the aerosol particle velocity, size, and concentration via the backscattering technique.",
      "The upper floor of the NAF is dedicated to the control room. The control room hosts the PLC through which the whole NAF working can be monitored and controlled.",
      "So far, things have been going smoothly. The facility is self-sufficient concerning human capital and has assisted in publishing about a dozen research papers. The facility is expected to initiate more such projects in the future. It is also planned to set up a safety committee for the NAF.An international workshop is scheduled that the DAE chairman will inaugurate. The workshop will witness participation from countries like Spain, Japan, South Korea, etc., with good collaborations with the facility.",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the writers and theirs alone.",
      "ThePOSHAct was constituted and enacted in 2013 in India aiming to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace and offer redressal in case of an offence. The act mandates that all employers constitute an internal complaints committee (ICC) to make recommendations for the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace. IIT Kanpur being a primary employer constituted its ICC in 2016, comprising of a presiding officer and five other members from both academic and non-academic sections, and an external member who has experience working with NGOs committed to the cause of women and issues related to sexual harassment. The committee has drafted two documents titled IIT Kanpur (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Students)Rules 2017and the IIT Kanpur (Inquiry into Complaints of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace)Rules, 2021, prescribing the rules for the inquiry into the complaints of sexual harassment. Through an analysis of the two ICC documents, we attempt to understand and critique the existing institutional mechanisms in IIT Kanpur for preventing and redressing internal complaints.",
      "Two primary problems in terms of the content of the policy documents are the vagueness of its language and the omission of relevant concerns. The vagueness of language indicates something which is mentioned but not adequately explained. It leads to confusing and random interpretations by all the parties involved. It may then also lead to arbitrary decision-making by the committee. In the Rules 2021 document, under the section ‘the manner of inquiry into the complaint,’ it is mentioned that “the past sexual history of the aggrieved woman shall not be subjected to probe during the inquiry proceedings and any such information shall be deemed to be irrelevant for the purposes of complaint of sexual harassment”. The lack of clarity about the definition of ‘sexual history’ allows intrusive questioning about the personal relationships of the complainant. Despite the sensitivity towards the complainant that is implied in the clause, it allows for the misogynist practice of judging a woman’s character by questioning the nature of her social and personal relationships. All her social relationships thus acquire a sexual meaning where the assumption is that her sexual history can be understood by examining her social relationships. The lack of clarity about what sexual history means opens up space for character judgment. Invoking the complainant’s relationships, her behavior in social settings, etc. has an undertone of moral policing. For example, the number of male friends a woman has, her outgoing nature, and physical expressions of affection towards her friends may be misinterpreted as her sexual availability. This kind of questioning suggests that the complaint is being judged on the basis of the complainant’s character rather than on the basis of the authenticity of the complaint. As such the onus of having to prove the validity of her complaint falls on the complainant.",
      "The lack of clarity in the clauses applies to the 2017 rules also. Although the document clearly mentions that the rules pertain to those complaints of sexual harassment filed against the students of IITK, there is confusion in the document whether the complainant could be women in the campus in general or specifically the students. When the document defines the act of sexual harassment, it refers to the aggrieved as a woman, while in another place the aggrieved is specifically mentioned to be a student of IIT Kanpur. Such vagueness in definitions and various other clauses causes confusion as to whether the rules apply to all women of IIT Kanpur or only to the students of IIT Kanpur for their complaint against another student of the institute.",
      "The omission of relevant concerns and questions is another point of contention. Omissions could be understood as ideas that are excluded or left out. For example, the Rules 2021 document provides the complainant with the option to make an appeal to the Board of Governors if she is dissatisfied with the report of the committee. But it does not mention the procedure to be followed to make an appeal. Unlike the 2021 document, the IITK Rules 2017, specifically drafted for the students, provides the procedure for appeal. But neither of the documents mentions the procedure to be followed if the complainant is uncomfortable with individual members of the committee and their remarks during the investigation process.",
      "The lack of an intersectional understanding of gender is another problem with the documents. An intersectional approach would see gender interacting with other power structures such as caste, religion, class, and family. People’s experience of sexual harassment in terms of the physical and psychological impact it has on them, and their ways of coping with the experience, and their preparedness to file a complaint depend on their social background. For example, the concerns of a student from an underprivileged caste, or class background may not be the same as that of a student from an urban, upper-class caste background when it comes to filing a complaint. Another way in which this lack manifests is the notion of the gender binary that identifies the victim as a woman while the perpetrator is always a man. The rules therefore turn a blind eye to the experiences of sexual harassment that men or people from the LGBTQI community may face. However, this is not a problem exclusive to the IITK ICC documents but one that is inherent in the law itself.",
      "Moreover, although the 2017 document is drafted specifically to address sexual harassment cases of students, it does not adopt a student-centric approach. Granted the existing hierarchy between faculty and student, a student-centric approach should entail adequate student representation within the committee, as well as adherence to a student’s perspective, which takes into account the context of students and their concerns. The document lacks both.",
      "In other words, without adequate student representation, the power would be concentrated within the committee, mostly composed of faculty members who might not always be able to appreciate and understand the context of students’ concerns. The concentration of power is a result of the top-down model of the committee structured by the institute. The top-down model means that the people at the top have the decision-making power while the people who are impacted by the policies have no say in the matter. The model may also lead to discriminatory practices during the process of investigation. In addition to being a workplace, IIT Kanpur is also an educational institution. Although adequate student representation does not in itself guarantee a student-centric approach, it is definitely a means to address the concentration of power and its consequences.",
      "To contest and challenge the undemocratic nature of the documents in what they say, how they have been constructed, what they imply, and their possible implementation, the campus community will have to initiate a conversation amongst themselves. Through such conversations, it is essential for the campus community to build a critical understanding of the various issues which concern them and possible ways to engage with those issues.",

      "In November last year, many wondered, paddling down at the sight of chopped trees along the roadside, speculating what was coming up. However, it wasn’t long before everyone could trace that the campus was getting a cycle track, a separate lane for the bicyclists to paddle on.",
      "The track soon found its way into discussions at student gatherings, with various questions loitering the atmosphere. So we at Vox decided to investigate and answer the campus community’s intriguing questions on the cycle track’s construction.",
      "",
      "",
      "Why was it constructed?",
      "The project was undertaken to ensure the safety of users as per the latest policy and norms set by the Board of Governors of IITK1. The official motive behind the construction of cycle tracks was to safeguard minor children (comprising majorly of school students)from getting involved in an accident due to merging and diverging activities by cyclists and to ensure cycle users’ safety and ease.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The Cost Incurred?",
      "Contrary to the rumoured notion of being alum funded, the track was constructed using a dedicated budget sanctioned by the institute. The institute spentone crore forty-six lakh rupees2on the cycle track, which was constructed in four major sections.",
      "",
      "The contractor is liable for the construction maintenance for one year, after which the zonal in charge of respective zones will maintain the cycle tracks.",
      "(IIT Kanpur’s area is divided into multiple zones for effective management)",
      "",
      "We also tried to get the administration’s view regarding the construction of the cycle track. However, we are still waiting to receive a response to our emails from the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DoIP).",
      "",
      "",
      "Post Construction",
      "While the newly constructed cycle track benefits the student community by providing alternate paths, shortcuts, and ambient experience, as well as a saviour from the scorching sun’s heat, it also apparently helps reduce the number of accidents.",
      "",
      "However, the bright blue colour of the cycle track, though drawing attention, is in stark contrast with the ambience of the campus. Additionally, the requirement of cutting trees for construction have raised environmental concerns.",
      "",
      "Several hindrances on the path, including the natural growth over the track, pose a safety risk for cyclists, especially at night.",
      "",
      "",
      "The unanswered Questions",
      "Despite the administration’s arguments, many questions still need to be answered. In an institute where bicycles are the primary mode of commute, providing a separate track for the same is still an alien concept for the students to digest. The effectiveness of the track can easily be judged by the number of its users and manner of use. With the hanging twigs and branches over the way, insufficient openings to the main road, lack of proper lighting and dissection at places discourages cyclists and has become an attractive choice for pedestrians.",
      "",
      "",
      "There is even more concern about the institute’s priority in fund allocation. While the maintenance of halls, critical for students’ security, keeps delaying owing to a lack of funds, a large sum of money is spent on the cycle track. The seriousness of the amount spent here can be gauged by the fact that Halls at IITK, on average, receive a fund of aroundthree lakhs*for maintenance, which, too, has reduced significantly over the past few years.",
      "We should also recognize that only a handful of people on the campus knew of the cycle track’s construction, depicting limited inclusion of the campus community in the decision-making. Nonetheless, since the cycle track now adds to one of the campus community’s key facilities, we can hope for a more efficient commute and fewer accidents.",

      "On June 22, IIT Kanpur successfully conducted an experiment for cloud seeding. The experiment was a success owing to the valuable contribution of numerous people from IIT Kanpur, including Dr. Manindra Agrawal, Dr Mainak Das, Dr Deepu Philip, and their associates spanning multiple departments with diverse backgrounds. With the approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the objective of the test was to successfully test all the equipment required for cloud seeding during an in-flight environment. To better grasp the intricate machinery behind this project, we spoke to Dr Manindra Agrawal in an exclusive interview.",
      "",
      "Vox: What exactly was the project and the intent of this experiment?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:The project is on the concept of artificial rain by a method called cloud seeding. This experiment was conductedto check if the systems required for cloud seeding operate well and collect the relevant data. An important clarification I would like to provide is that‘Cloud seeding was successfully achieved’ is incorrect. The reason is that the intent was to check the systems and collect data, not to seed the cloud and make it rain. In any case, that day from the night, it was already raining, so there was no way even to find out if we had succeeded, even if we had tried. Some media reports are saying otherwise, but that’s not correct.",
      "",
      "Vox:How did this project start?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:The concept of cloud seeding was taken up five years ago and has been wholly led and funded by the institute. The Uttar Pradesh government had shown interest earlier, but things slowed down due to covid. It was decided to use IITK’s ownCessna aircraftfor this purpose, for which collaboration with theUS-based company ‘Cessna’was sought to facilitate instrumentation and equipment fitting on the plane. However, the progress was halted for over two and a half years due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "During this time, efforts were focused on obtaining validation from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which recently took place in the last six months. This project isestimated to cost about one crore,which the institute has entirely borne up to this point. The recent flight marked a significant milestone as it was the first time flares were attached and fired to collect data on flight behavior. DGCA members were present to observe and gather relevant information. The data will now undergo analysis, and once the DGCA confirms its accuracy and safety, the aircraft will be flown according to the project’s requirements. The primary objective of the flight was to assess firing and aircraft dynamics, with a particular emphasis on stability.",
      "",
      "Vox:How is cloud seeding done?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:This technology involves salt (typically AgI). Particles of diameter 1-10 microns are sprayed onto the existing clouds. With the introduction of these microparticles, condensation starts, resulting in the increased weight of these particles and subsequent precipitation. The mixture is released into the clouds with the help of flare attachments. These flares contain a salt mixture and gunpowder. They expand and spray the mixture into the air when fused. An additional advantage of flares is that the airplane can fly below the clouds, whereas the hot air surrounding the particles can rise up to the clouds, resulting in a safer flight. Cloud seeding is a well-established technology in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "Vox:How does this project contribute to cloud seeding technology?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:While cloud seeding is an established technique, IIT Kanpur furthered the research with its unique approach. The institute experimented with various salts, yielding promising results.Considering the potential harm associated with large quantities of silver iodide, the institute explored alternatives in common salt of different granularities. As a result, a mixture with a reduced amount of AgI was successfully produced.Dr Mainak Das and his lab played a pivotal role in achieving these breakthroughs.",
      "",
      "Vox:What is the Environmental Impact of this project?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:Cloud seeding allows for the redistribution of rainfall in a region while the total amount of rain remains relatively constant. However, careful consideration must be given to avoid concentrating all the rainfall in one area at the expense of the others. While the potentially harmful effects of the composition mixture require thorough testing, the high dilution of the salt mixture suggests negligible hazardous impact.",
      "The project is designed to serve two purposes.",
      "First, it can be beneficial in regions experiencing little or no rainfall despite the presence of clouds.",
      "Second, in large cities with high pollution levels during winter, cloud seeding can temporarily alleviate pollution through rainfall.",
      "",
      "Vox: What lies ahead for cloud seeding?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:Obtaining full approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is considered the first crucial step in the project to ensure a perfect setup. Our team is diligently gathering and providing all the necessary data to satisfy the requirements of the DGCA, aiming to secure their final approval. Meanwhile, we’ll initiate discussions with some government entities. We are not interested in doing this on a commercial basis. Notably, there is already growing interest from various state governments regarding the project. The team anticipates that this approval could be granted within the next month or two if everything progresses as planned. Fortunately, this timeframe aligns well with the upcoming rainy season, making it less critical to perform cloud seeding immediately. Once the approval is obtained, the team intends to conduct further trials to assess the outcomes. The team is optimistic and eager to see the results of these trials.",
      "",
      "So, is climate control within our grasp? Certainly not; we are still far from causing artificial rain, as mentioned by Dr Manindra Agrawal, but to recapitulate the essence of this project, we are definitely looking forward to a bright future ahead of us. This success is yet another example where IIT Kanpur has taken a significant step towards achieving solutions to real-life problems faced by the Indian Subcontinent through dedicated effort and cutting-edge research on a collaborative front. Despite facing many obstacles in the path of this project, IITK has achieved a remarkable feat by managing a project of this magnitude solely on its own. We will eagerly look forward to the successful large-scale deployment of this project soon. Congratulations, and good luck to the team!",

      "Following a major incident in Hall 13, where students were found intoxicated, the Warden-in-Charge enacted a ban on the entry of female students into the premises of Hall 13. In the subsequent days, when female campus residents tried to enter hall 13, to their surprise, entry was denied to them, and the only reason given by the SIS guards was that they had been told to do so. Due to the rumors, confusion, and contentions surrounding this incident, our team investigated the issue. Continue reading to know what happened.",
      "On April 30, following an incident where some residents of H13 along with their female acquaintances were found intoxicated, a ban was imposed on the entry of female students into the Hall 13 premises.",
      "The hall office conveyed that a few incidents in the recent past, as well as the incident involving the intoxication of students, impelled them to impose the ban. Any officials involved in the imposition of this ban, however, did not formally communicate the ban. The closest relevant notice was an email notifying the expulsion of the resident(s) involved in the incident. When probed further, it was found that none of the student representatives, the President, Students’ Gymkhana, or the CoSHA Convener (who acts as the representative of Hall 13 due to the lack of HEC in the hall) were consulted or informed about the ban. The only official who was informed about the ban prior to the imposition was the Dean of Students’ Affairs.  According to a notice sent by the hall warden to the hall office, the ban is to stay in place until “further notice”.",
      "In conversation with the hall office, the main reasoning provided to support the ban was to deter students from bringing and consuming intoxicating substances inside the hall premises.  Additionally, they said that a large number of first-year UG girls were entering Hall 13 by writing “canteen” on the entrance gate register but were actually going to the hall residents’ rooms. According to the hall office, the warden received multiple emails from hall residents and their parents complaining about several objectionable activities that had created an unsuitable environment for students. Therefore, to stop such rule violations, the warden decided to restrict the entry of girls in hall 13.",
      "When asked why the residents were not informed about the ban, the hall office stated that emailing the residents didn’t appear to be necessary in this case, since no restrictions had been imposed on the residents of H13. Adding further, the hall office manager said that the hall warden made this decision taking into consideration the approaching midsems of Y22. He was of the opinion that the freshers were in need of extra guidance and that the ban was necessary to bring discipline back to the hall. In light of the numerous incidents that have occurred in H13 over the past few months, the hall administration has taken steps to reassure the community that there are consequences for violating hall rules.",
      "Considering the pivotal role that the warden played in this situation, we emailed Prof. P. M. Mohite, warden-in-charge of Hall 13, requesting an interview. However, our request was denied by stating that“These are Hall 13 affairs. We do not want to interact with any third party about it. Thank you for your concern.”",
      "According to the President Students’ Gymkhana, as communicated to him by the warden, the ban would be imposed for the entire duration of the stay of Y22 in Hall 13. While the CoSHA representative, Dhruv, and the President both agreed that the move was harsh, the President further opined that the ban should not have been imposed. He added that he had confronted the warden several times for the removal of the ban, to no avail.",
      "This situation raises several questions, starting with how does the consumption of intoxicants relate to the restriction of entry of female students? Was this measure extreme? Or was it necessary and in the best interest of students? Does a blanket restriction on inter-gender hostel movement provide a definitive solution to tackle the central issue of intoxication on campus? Hall residents can consume substances irrespective of the presence of girls and can even partake in other unwarranted activities outside the hall. Instead, can we look for more impactful solutions such as sensitization sessions, individual counseling, or any other measures having a more lasting impact?",
      "It also sheds light on how in general, the right for genders to interact with each other in public spaces like classrooms, cafes, etc., is considered a fundamental privilege that cannot be revoked. On the contrary, this same sense of absoluteness doesn’t seem to extend to private spaces such as rooms in halls. Free inter-hall movement is seen as a “privilege” rather than a basic right that cannot be taken away from the students.",
      "The situation also leads us to more critical questions involving the power dynamics at hand. The warden’s power in matters involving Hall 13 seems absolute, especially in this situation. Imposing a ban without informing any residents or the student representatives, parties most affected by this decision, raises concerns about the feedback system and the value the administration gives to student representation. In this case, there is no body that mediates between these two entities nor a platform where a student can register complaints regarding hall administration. This seemingly absolute power that an appointed faculty possesses in students’ residential spaces raises essential questions about student representation in Hall administration. Is it time that Hall 13 forms an HEC? If not, then what measures can we take to make sure that such incidents do not take place again?",
      "This event also highlights the importance of responsibly exercising the rights given to students and student bodies. It emphasizes the fact that responsibility and freedom go hand in hand. All things considered, it is clear that no situation is black or white, ergo no decision is clearly right or wrong, and as is the case, there are two sides to every story. However, there needs to be accountability and representation at every step in decision making, lest we lose the ‘student’ part of student decision-making.",

      "Ashutosh Muduly, an ex-Quiz Club Coordinator and an active Media and Cultural(MnC) Council member, had applied for the post ofInstitute Secretary for Non-Performing Arts in the MnC Council. After the interviews and voting by the outgoing core committee, it was announced thatAshutosh won the verdict, 11 votes to 6. Around two days later, Kaustubh Agarwal, the General Secretary of the Media and Cultural Council, used his Veto power to dismiss the result. Owing to the rumours, confusion and contentions surrounding this incident, our team investigated the issue and talked to various stakeholders. Continue reading to know what happened.",
      "The Student Gymkhana of our institute is a vast body with everything from a full-fledged Senate to different councils and cells coming under its umbrella. An essential part of the Gymkhana are the Councils, and each council is led by a General Secretary (GenSec), a position democratically elected by the campus – but the GenSec themselves can’t do everything alone, and that necessitated a need for the creation of the erstwhile “Associate Head” position which was recently renamed as the “Institute Secretary”.",
      "What exactly is the role of this post?The Gymkhana Review Committee[1],[2]of the tenure 2019-20 defined the responsibility of the Associate Head (or Institute Secretary) as assisting the General Secretary in performing their duties. The committee defined the appointment procedure of Associate Head (Institute Secretary) voting by the outgoing council core committee (consisting of outgoing General Secretary, previous Institute Secretaries, and all the outgoing coordinators/leaders of various clubs and societies in the council), to include the say of all sections of the council.",
      "A major concern of the Gymkhana Review Committee was the friction these position holders might have with the General Secretary. The Review Committee addressed this discord as a difference of vision. Later in 2020, a document[3]passed in the Senate, created by some outgoing and incoming general secretaries mentioned- “the students selected for this post should be compatible to some extent-” as an essential fact and introduced the concept of Veto. According to it,in appointing the Institute Secretaries, the Incoming General Secretary holds the right to ‘Veto’ a candidate.  It means that the GenSec holds the right to overturn the decision made by the outgoing committee if he/she feels“incompatible”with the elected candidate.",
      "After the verdict was announced, Ashutosh was naturally appalled by this decision. His primary point was the fact that compatibility should not overshadow credibility. He asserted that this sets a bad precedent for the future as any person willing to become the Institute Secretary would believe that being on good terms with the incoming General Secretary is more effective than working hard in the council.",
      "He also questioned the delay in the veto from the General Secretary. He pointed out that it isn’t fair for the General Secretary to announce the Veto after the results for the nominations were out. Ashutosh says that if the General Secretary found him incompatible, he should’ve vetoed the nomination instead of the result. He said he was surprised that veto was utilized, given Kaustubh had clearly told the candidates before the interviews that he had no plan to do so and would respect their decision.",
      "During our interview, Kaustubh admitted that the timing of usage of veto was inappropriate. In hindsight, he realized that he should have promptly shared his opinion with Ashutosh after receiving the nomination. Kaustubh further explained that after the nomination outcome, he had to reconsider his position on employing the veto power for the council’s benefit. While he recognized that the procedure outlining veto is inadequate and ideally should be more comprehensive, he felt compelled to implement the decision in order to prioritize the council’s best interests.",
      "When we asked him why he gives more value to compatibility than credibility, he clarified thatcompatibility and credibility should have to go together to make sure that the council doesn’t run into any issues, and Veto is a right given to the General Secretary to ensure this. The outgoing General Secretary also defended the concept of veto when he was questioned by the outgoing core committee. He said that compatibility and credibility are independent of each other. The former is determined by the incoming GenSec and the latter is determined by the outgoing core committee. Even if one of them gives a negative decision, the candidate cannot be appointed and neither of the two entities can have a say in each other’s decisions.",
      "On questioning Kaustubh about compatibility with Ashutosh, he answered that when they worked together, he felt the work could have been better if he was by himself or with someone other than Ashutosh.",
      "When questioned on how his decision to veto could damage the perception of the committee for upcoming core teams, Kaustubh claimed that if Ashutosh were in the council, it would cause many hindrances in the functioning. He believed that as a team, they would not be able to achieve targets and solve problems in their tenure, leading to further, more significant issues. Since Kaustubh was elected to improve the council, he saw this tradeoff as necessary, despite acknowledging Ashutosh’s dedicated work as a coordinator.",
      "After Kaustubh used his Veto power to dismiss the result, the matter was taken to the Student’s Senate where Ashutosh brought various claims against the veto decision ranging from the unfairness to remove him after winning the election to the lack of proper reasoning behind the move.[4]",
      "In the first special meeting of the Senate[5], Prashant (Chairperson, Students’ Senate) affirmed that all rules had been followed and the veto decision remained valid. According to the rule of veto, as of now, Kaustubh is not obligated to provide an explanation for his decision.",
      "When we asked him about the reason behind the rule’s existence, Prashant suggested that it might have been born out of the belief that it would be unfair to elect someone without consulting the General Secretary. The General Secretary is entrusted with the responsibility of working in collaboration with the elected Institute Secretaries throughout their tenure. Thus, the Senate of 2019-20, in establishing the rule, likely considered the veto as a necessary power to ensure the fruitful collaboration of the General Secretary and Institute Secretaries in their efforts to enhance the council.",
      "When we asked about his response to Ashutosh’s concerns, Prashant acknowledged that the current rule regarding veto might have loopholes and the potential for future failures. As a solution, he proposed that the Rules and Procedure Committee (RPC) should review and examine the rule and its procedures, a suggestion that was agreed upon by the Senate.",
      "The Rules and Procedure Committee (RPC) is responsible for overseeing the rules and procedures of the entire Gymkhana. Presently, the committee consists only of the Chairperson and Parliamentarian. As of now,  the RPC meeting has not taken place.",
      "The current problems with veto are not just limited to its conception but also thelack of clarity regarding its process. Kaustubh personally sought guidance from various past and present Gymkhana members to comprehend the intricacies of the veto procedure. As highlighted by Abhiraj, the Parliamentarian of the Students’ Senate, the veto rule lacks thorough scrutiny to ensure the indispensability of every word and sentence, as well as comprehensive coverage of all possible scenarios and edge cases. Furthermore, since the rule has not been incorporated into the constitution, it does not provide exhaustive guidelines.",
      "When our team asked why such a huge power was not given a proper framework at the least, with there being no mention of any procedure regarding the use of veto, renominations, and the boundaries of using veto, The Parliamentarian responded that “it was up to the former parliamentarians to answer that”.",
      "This lack of framework leads to a large amount of subjectivity in implementing the rule. It still not clear whether Ashutosh is eligible for any other position within the council core committee. It’s also still not clear whether there is a limit on the number of times the veto power can be utilized.",
      "And to top it all, the major issue is that the General Secretary can veto an elected person without being accountable for the reasoning. This deviates from the practice observed in the real world- the person exercising veto is accountable for their decision with reasoning. For example, in the US Senate, “A veto occurs when the President returns the legislation to the House in which it originated, usually with a message explaining the rationale for the Veto. This Veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House.”",
      "Renominations were held for both Performing and Non-Performing Arts Institute Secretaries where two candidates applied for each post. On 28th May, in a meeting chaired by the outgoing General Secretary, the interviews and elections were held with the outgoing core committee on the panel. After 1.5 hours of interviewing each for both the positions, Jitesh Sethi for Non-Performing Arts and Akhil Sagwal for Performing Arts were elected. The results were verified by the Senate and the incoming Institute Secretaries were introduced to the incoming core committee.",
      "While Kaustubh took measures to ensure that the need for veto does not occur again by discussing his vision and action plans with the candidates beforehand, a member of the outgoing core committee confessed, “ a minimally interactive 3 hour online meet was a cheap substitute for the original highly-interactive all-night long offline meet. The contrast was evident when we were told to keep the questions to the minimum.”",
      "“Absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely”",
      "This quote resonates strongly in the context of the veto rule implemented within the Student Gymkhana. The rule not only lacks the requirement for an explanation behind a veto decision but also lacks a mechanism to override such a decision, thereby negating the presence of checks and balances.",
      "At IITK, the value of equality and providing a voice to all has always been paramount. The establishment of the Student Gymkhana itself aimed to empower students to take charge of decision-making. This issue of Veto goes beyond a mere legal right mentioned in the Senate documents. It strikes at the core of a fundamental issue – a student’s removal from their elected position, undermining the values we hold dear. It’s a case of a student being removed from a post, a post to which he was voted into but was removed from, removed by a student peer because of a vaguely defined term – “Compatibility.”",
      "We firmly believe that accountability and transparency are fundamental pillars for the effective functioning of any organization. In the context of this incident, not only the absence of these principles is concerning but also the assertion that they undermine the purpose of the rule raises significant concerns and challenges its overall fairness.",
      "This scenario prompts students to question the path to personal growth and competence as the key to achieving our goals. We must recognize that a mindset, which places excessive emphasis on personal connections rather than knowledge and merit, erodes the values we cherish and hold dear.  It’s imperative to balance compatibility with credibility. Otherwise, students will focus more on the former than the latter, focusing less on what they know and more on who they know.",

Their door-to-door services (washing and ironing) streamline our daily routines, sparing us the time and effort required to tend to our clothing. The large number of students using the services provided by Dhobis is evidence of the strong preference students have for the Dhobi’s services.",
      "The other alternative is – you guessed it-the washing machine.",
      "Most students prefer not to use washing machines for a number of reasons.\nWhen one loads a bunch of dirty clothes in their laundry bag to leave for the washing machine room, the fear of not finding an empty, clean, and usable washing machine is a real concern. During the washing, one has to pay multiple visits to ensure the machine is still working and has not stopped abruptly midway- as is common. Afterward, you have to dry as well as iron your clothes. For a student, this process takes a significant amount of time to complete. Not to mention, the washing machines in every hall are in abysmal numbers. There are around 4-5 machines in a hall for hundreds of residents.",
      "In addition to that, the machines we are provided with aredomesticwashing machines and notcommercialones. Over time, the daily, relentless loads take their toll and cause domestic washing machines to succumb to inevitable faults. This is the state of things considering more than 50% of students don’t use washing machines yet (as per the number Dhobis claim). Adding additional washing machines to the halls also appears highly unlikely due to the limited funds allocated to the HEC. Each washing machine comes with a hefty price tag, making it difficult to increase their numbers.",
      "On the contrary, a dhobi offers a door-to-door service of not only washing your clothes but also drying and ironing them, in which virtually no time is lost at the cost of 250-500 (varies individually) rupees per month. For many, thewashing machine alternativeis daunting. But even if we were to assume that somehow, we will have fully functional commercial-grade washing machines and students with the grit to maintain them, the biggest problem is still the amount of time and passive effort it takes to use these machines.",
      "However- and you are probably unaware of this fact- Dhobis have been asked to vacate campus premises multiple times over the last 15 years and something similar is happening at the moment. The primary argument by the administration is related to the legality of their residency(covered later in the article). They claim that the leases for their residences were originally issued under the names of their fathers, who have since passed away. As a result, these leases are now deemed invalid, rendering their current occupation illegal. Further, as the institute is growing, there is a  need for land to build new infrastructure. The dhobi ghat, they believe might serve as land for upcoming infrastructure For more background refer to –https://voxiitk.com/iitk-home-no-more/",
      "With this context in mind, it becomes imperative for us to reflect on our role in the scheme of things-",
      "Asstudents, Dhobi’s service directly caters to our laundry needs, without any intermediaries involved. This makes us their primary customer, and so one of the principal stakeholders. The potential impact of whether or not Dhobis stay on campus has a direct bearing on our daily lives. Not only are we the consumers for the Dhobis’ services, but as students of this institute, we are also stakeholders in major decision-making. When the administration deliberates on a matter that could significantly impact our daily life – even the seemingly minor aspect of spending 50-60 minutes on laundry, it makes sense to take into account the implications of such a decision on students.",
      "The Dhobis claim that attempts to evict them from the campus have not just been isolated episodes but a sustained series of subtle coercions. One of these, they say-  is the administration’s refusal to grant them access to a basic necessity:  atoiletin the workplace. Dhobis have had to defecate in the open spaces right across the Dhobhighat despite the Swachh Bharat Mission followed throughout the nation.",
      "The houses they live in are at risk of collapsing. The Dhobis say that there have been incidents of collapse in the past, causing severe injuries to some. However, the Institute Works Department (IWD) has turned a deaf ear to these concerns and neglected necessary renovations. Overall, the Dhobis describe their situation as an ongoing pattern of neglect and subtle coercion. The episode that triggered the series of events leading to this article was also along similar lines –",
      "Dhobis told us that they were asked by the Estate Office to complete a police verification, following which they would be eligible to receive hall passes. When they went to a nearby police station in Kalyanpur for the same, the concerned policemen clarified that dhobis need not get a police verification done since they are already living inside the campus.",
      "“A few days later,” claims the dhobi,“the police chowki received a call from the Estate Office, who want our passes to be issued only if we are able to produce a residential address outside of IIT.”",
      "The administration has demanded that Dhobis live outside campus, and can continue to serve students like other contractual employees. We asked Dhobis about the feasibility of this idea, Here is what they had to say about it-",
      "“We work around the clock, 24/7.”",
      "6000 customers means a lot, lot of clothes. In order to get clothes washed on time, Dhobis have to work in shifts, so the Dhobi Ghat has to be functional almost around the clock. Dhobis start their work as early as 5 am and work as late as 3 am the next day. Clothes are washed in stages- they are soaked, slammed, cleaned, rinsed, and finally left out to dry. Given a limited amount of space and many clothes, this entire process cannot be completed unless they keep working. This also includes figuring out logistics such as determining the order in which clothes will be left out to dry. If they work as regular employees, they will only be allowed to work for 8-12 hours. They claim it is impossible to wash so many clothes if they are made to work 9-5.",
      "“It’s a family occupation”",
      "The Dhobi is not alone in washing clothes- he is aided by his family. His wife, kids – everybody has a part to play in the washing process. This, they claim- is another necessity to successfully handle the number of clothes they receive. If they are to work as regular employees, only one person from the family will be allowed inside campus premises-which would again, make it impossible to meaningfully finish work in time.",
      "“Students request services at odd times”",
      "The Dhobis tell us that almost every day – there are students who need to get their clothes washed, stains removed, ironed, etc, immediately. They usually get this done by calling their Dhobis, who collect clothes at odd hours and return them the next day. These odd hours look like 1 am in the morning or 9 pm at night. They make the point that not being on campus premises does not allow them to cater to these cases.",
      "“Where will we go?”",
      "Even if the dhobis agree to move outside, they have nowhere to go. They claim they do not have the capital to buy or rent land and/or build a new dhobighat. It’s important to note here that they pay a monthly rent to the institute- for property, electricity, and water. Further, most of them barely attended school and have mostly taken over their Father’s occupations. They told us how they live hand to mouth and how – once evicted, they will not have any means of subsistence- which will affect their services.",
      "Behind the fervent arguments surrounding the legal and utilitarian aspects of the dhobis’ stay on campus, another aspect remains hidden—their relationship to the campus. These individuals, who were born on IIT Kanpur soil and spent their lives living and working on this campus-have seen the ebbs and flows of student life- batch after batch, becoming a part of our collective life here. Forged through interactions and shared experiences, this campus holds for them a sentimental significance.",
      "In 1973, a gang of dakoits launched a brazen assault on our dhobi-ghat. To stop them from plundering students’ clothes- my father endured the searing pain of two bullet wounds—one grazing his cheek and the other striking his leg…and given a chance, I would do the same-remarked one of the many, as washer-folk gathered around us.",
      "When the Institute was established at its current location, a group of dhobis received an invitation from the founding Director, Prof Kelkar. The dhobis played the role in meeting the laundry needs of the campus residents. In return, they were promised a designated work area with basic amenities, such as a reliable water source, sufficient space for clothes drying and storage, and residential quarters for their families. The premises were officially licensed under the names of the primary male members of each dhobi family. Over the years, as the student body grew manifold, the responsibility was passed down to the subsequent generations, with the children of the original dhobis continuing their families’ occupation. These male members, have since passed away – and their children have not been formally allotted the property by the institute- this is the premise behind the claim of their illegal occupancy.",
      "The administration cites several arguments: first, they claim that the increasing use of washing machines by students has reduced the need for dhobi services; second, they propose making alternate arrangements, such as providing more washing machines or bringing in professional laundry services, to ensure students’ convenience; and third, the administration argues that the space occupied by the dhobis is required for constructing new hostels and infrastructure to accommodate the rising number of students in the Institute, and to relieve the crunch.",
      "“Understanding that there are families living in that area and it will be tough to find another place all by themselves, the campus administration has discussed it with the city administration to help find a shelter for all these families and is also willing to provide any kind of help they would therefore need”– this is a statement from 2018, by professor Manindra Agrawal, who was the Deputy Director at that time. We asked the Dhobis about this episode, and they responded by saying that no such arrangement was made following the promise.",
      "The administration of our institute operates with pragmatism and practicality, running an institute of this magnitude comes with its own set of difficult targets and hurdles. They too are stakeholders in this intricate system, working to meet these targets and fulfilling their assigned responsibilities. Then there is the other part of campus- our working staff: the Dhobis, the Mess workers, sanitation staff, SiS guards, and more. These individuals serve as providers of essential services directly benefiting us- the students, as their consumers. Oftentimes, there are tensions between what the goals of the administration demand vs. the welfare and rights of the working staff on campus.  Acknowledging the power dynamics inherent in these relationships, it becomes our responsibility as students- to stand in solidarity with them. After all, we are direct beneficiaries of their daily services, and their well-being closely corresponds to our own.",

    "content": [
      "IIT Kanpur first got a particle accelerator in 1968. At that time, it was among one of the first big pieces of equipment, after the IBM computer at IITK campus. The first particle accelerator was a 2 MV Van-de-graff accelerator donated by the US through the Kanpur Indo-American Program (KIAP). In 2006, the original accelerator was dismantled and disposed of since it was no longer suitable for newer projects. The currently installed Tandetron Accelerator was purchased in 2006 from High Voltage Engineering Europa, Netherlands and established in 2008. Professor Vishwas Kulkarni was responsible for setting up the accelerator. Professor Aditya Kelkar has been looking after the facility since 2014. Presently, IIT Kanpur is the only IIT to host a particle accelerator, but some other research institutions like BARC, TIFR, Punjab University and BHU do host accelerators.",
      "Ion Generator",
      "An accelerator produces a high-energy ion beam. The accelerator on campus is aTandem accelerator, which means that it uses the same voltage to accelerate an ion twice. In a tandem accelerator, the main accelerator tube has both its ends grounded, and it is segmented. There are pellets which are separated by insulators. Successive pallets are at higher potentials, with the central pallet at 1.7 MV. As soon as the beam crosses the central pallet, it collides with high-energy gas, which changes its polarity to positive. The central pallet then repels it, accelerating it further. Therefore, using this tandem accelerator, one can obtain beams of energies up to 3.4 MeV. An environment of Sulphur Hexafluoride is maintained to maintain such high voltages because air breaks down at high voltages (di-electric breakdown?). There is a unit to compress SF6 gas that compresses it to 7 bar.",
      "Accelerator Tube",
      "At this point, the beam is no longer focused. An ensemble of magnetic lenses – concave-convex-concave is used to focus the beam. (Why are three lenses used? – there’s always some variation in the energy, and a single lens would focus beams with varying energy at different points – analogous to chromatic operation in optics). The lenses themselves are electrostatic, and their power supplies can supply up to 20 kV. The focal length of this ensemble of lenses is around 2-3 metres.",
      "Lens Setup",
      "The accelerator is very expensive, and to use it efficiently; multiple beamlines are used. A switching magnet is used to direct the beam towards the desired beamline. The magnetic field bends the beam through a certain angle to direct it.  This allows an experiment to take place while preparations for others are underway. The laboratory has two dedicated beamlines, one for microbeam experiments and the other for Rutherford backscattering. Every beamline also has parallel plates that allow for fine-tuning the direction of the beam.",
      "3 millimetre thick tubes are used to ensure that X-ray or other radiation does not leak out. An online Geiger counter keeps track of ambient radiation to provide added safety, and the system shuts down as soon as it exceeds the permissible value. There are similar safeguards when water pressure drops or the vacuum partially fails.",
      "The laboratory gets electricity from the institute, but it has its own 100 kV transformer to isolate the grounding. The laboratory also has a 62 kW UPS that is used to shut down the accelerator safely.",
      "Ions beams require a vacuum to move. In the accelerator, turbomolecular pumps are used to create a vacuum. Fun fact, they work on the same principle as a jet engine! The laboratory has multiple turbomolecular pumps. The life of a pump is ten years, so there is a fair chance that one pump fails every year. This constitutes the bulk of maintenance costs.",
      "Microbeam Setup",
      "The annex was built after the building just to house the microbeam setup. Beam coming from the accelerator is a centimeter in diameter, and the lenses in the microbeam tube are used to focus it down to micrometer size. It is used to create small channels in materials and for scanning.",
      "Funding the atomic particle accelerator is essential for its maintenance and existence altogether. In its embryonic phase, the accelerator got seed money for its first three years from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India. Now it is funded by IIT Kanpur itself. Due to the financial scenario in the status quo, the instrument lacks a root for steady funding. The institute has granted funds even in situations where the accelerator faced unanticipated failures in the technical domain highlighting its support for the instrument. A certain sum of the maintenance cost is financed from the institute’s research funds.The accelerator was manufactured by a Dutch company called High Voltage Engineering Europa, and many of its components are not manufactured in India. In the past, when one of the components failed, the only option was to ship it back to the Netherlands. It used to be an expensive process.The team administering the accelerator is incorporating indigenous mechanisms for maintenance intending to truncate the dependence on the parent company, and they have been satisfactorily successful in this regard. Professor Kelkar claims that with respect to high-voltage electronics, they are in a position to maintain everything on their own, and hence not a lot of funding is required.",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, which played a crucial role in p-wave scattering, the accelerator has been unable to make significant progress due to several setbacks. Its chief investigator, Professor Kulkarni, passed away in 2010, and the machine malfunctioned shortly after that. It was re-established in 2014 and resumed functioning in 2016. Despite this, the accelerator appears to be rather promising, as several studies yielding significant results are now being conducted on it. In addition, there have been no catastrophic mishaps that have harmed humans or machines. Since its inception, security and safety standards have been in place.",
      "The accelerator’s accessibility is not limited to the physics department alone. There has been collaboration with the mechanical department, a faculty member from the chemical engineering department, and BSBE.",
      "In addition, external collaboration with Flexible Electronics to determine the composition of conducting ink has occurred.  Current collaborations include one with NIT Patna and one with Saha Institute (Calcutta). The lab welcomes additional cooperation.",

      "The residents of GH-1 have raised concerns that the authorities have not adequately addressed them for more than a week. The consequence was two significant protests led by the residents of Hall 4 and GH-1.",
      "On the morning of March 26, residents of GH-1 were surprised by the sound of construction as workers began to demolish the basketball and badminton court to make way for a new block. According to the residents they weren’t informed or consulted about this development beforehand. However, it was built merely 4 meters from the current residing block, leading to concerns about their well-being, academic productivity, and a need for more communication from the HEC and authorities. The residents raised the following problems-",
      "After the construction began, the students’ hostility grew from small WhatsApp groups to more significant in-person discussions. After the residents raised questions, the hall president emailed the General Body Meeting (GBM) on the 27th of March, stating that the construction is for building a residential block to accommodate the increasing student strength. The mail also mentioned that the HEC was unaware of the “when and where” of the construction plans.",
      "After pressure from residents during an informal meet-up, the Hall President called for an urgent GBM on the 29th of March. After an hour of heated arguments with the HEC, the warden was called to address the residents’ concerns. Warden answered the resident’s queries and promised a meeting with the ADHA for further grievance. It was decided to halt the construction until further discussion with the authorities.",
      "On 30th March, the ADHA visited GH1 and agreed to discuss the concerns with the DoSA (Director of Student Affairs), DoIP (Dean of Infrastructure and Planning), and DD (Deputy Director). After the meeting, the warden sent a mail stating that the ADHA said it was impossible to stop the construction, but the authorities would consider the residents’ concerns. Around 300 residents signed a petition, which was decided to be presented in the meeting with the authorities.",
      "The construction resumed on 1st April. The meeting with the authorities was scheduled for the afternoon of the same day. The residents felt that the ADHA was unable to address the concerns raised by the GBM. However, the ADHA assured the residents that the construction would be running between 9 am to 6 pm.",
      "At night, when the construction didn’t stop until 11 pm, around 60 residents gathered in front of the hall in demand to talk to the administration. In the middle of this, the DoIP showed up to talk to the contractor. The residents alleged that after they confronted the DoIP for answers, he ran away while saying that he did not have to talk to the residents. At around 12:30 am, as more administration personnel failed to arrive, the entire crowd started to walk towards the director’s bungalow. The students had one significant demand: to have an open-house discussion with the concerned authorities.",
      "Around 2:30 am, the Security Chairman, J Ramkumar, arrived at the site to listen to their concerns. A meeting with all the officials was promised in the morning, but the students wanted written assurance from the Security Chairman about the next day’s meetings. They were only willing to talk to the DD, as they found the DoIP and ADHA unreliable. After a heated discussion, the final mail was sent by Prof. J Ramkumar to the PSG while copying the presidents of all the girls’ hostels, consisting of Hall 4, GH1, and Hall 6. The mail pointed out four points-",
      "As soon as the president of GH1 forwarded the mail to the residents, the crowd dispersed at 4 in the morning.",
      "As agreed upon in the mail, all residents gathered on GH1’s lawn the following afternoon at 2 pm. After an hour of waiting, the officials didn’t show up. The residents felt betrayed as the Security Chairman’s assurance was being rendered useless. The girls became impatient and started protesting in front of the GH1 gate. They set out for the Kargil Chowk to participate in yet another demonstration. They blocked the road entirely restricting the movement of vehicles.",
      "The PSG, CoSHA Convener, and GH-1 president came to the protest after a meeting with the authorities to convey the authorities’ message – that the residents should understand why such a construction is necessary, that the girl students in the future would have to live in a crunch.",
      "This made the residents furious on three levels- one, the authorities did not keep up to their promise and held a closed-door meeting without them; two, the authorities wanted girls to understand and adjust to the ongoing construction, not adequately engaging with the issues they raised; and three, although IITK is a premier institution, it could not a make timely projections about the number of incoming students and arrange the necessary accommodation.",
      "Being extremely frustrated with the authorities and the student representatives, the residents marched to the director’s bungalow. On the way, the residents caught the director in his car while returning from an event.  After a discussion with the director, he promised to send a mail regarding the open house to be held in a maximum of two days from today, and then the protesters dispersed. The director urged them to confront him in his office if the mail wasn’t delivered. They now hope to meet the director with the following demands:",
      "1. Stopping construction altogether in their halls. They urge the administration to look for long-term solutions like building/allocation of new hostels to girls.",
      "2. Restoration of sports facilities at their residences.",
      "To get a statement from the authorities, our team reached out to ADHA, to which no response was received at the time of publication.",
      "Stay tuned for further developments on the issue.",

      "The last decade in the Indian start-up ecosystem saw the rise of several unicorns – start-ups that reached a value worth a billion dollars. An integral part of this ecosystem and the culture of entrepreneurship in the country has been the list of IIT alumni, with firms building software to establishing household brands. The pandemic saw the rise of some of the more innovative startups from IIT Kanpur, like The Ventilator Project and E-spin Nanotech, that were in the headlines. Urban Company and Sharechat have grown to become names synonymous with the start-up space in the country, both being led by founders from IIT Kanpur. In this article that follows, the Vox team aims to de-construct and investigate the start-up ‘culture’ on campus and bring forth an idea about what it takes to build from scratch, and scale up, whilst being an IIT Kanpur student.",
      "Starting a venture as a student is one of those unpredictable roads that always brings forth a sense of excitement as well as uncertainty. In our efforts to investigate the start-up space at our campus, we reached out to the Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre(SIIC). We interviewed budding entrepreneurs and faculty administration to discuss the institute’s policies and what lies ahead for the student entrepreneurs.",
      "The journey for each entrepreneur on campus has been different, but the struggles shape a generalised pattern. One such entrepreneur we interviewed was Kshitiz, a third-year undergraduate, who has been trying to find like-minded people to form a team for his startup idea but remarked about the lack of help from the administration and the academic load having put this idea on a halt. He mentions that some help was provided through Student Mentorship Program (SMP) conducted by E-Cell. Still, the inability to get proper direction or a team has led him to push away this idea for further pursuit after graduation.",
      "Vox interviewed another student of IITK who has successfully registered his company, Arun (founder of Pnapaao). He has always wanted to develop a business of his own, and so the main purpose for his joining IITK was to avail access to more resources and easy availability of financial support, but he too had to experience plenty of hurdles to establish his company. The lack of primal necessities to build up a team and the constant juggling between academics and entrepreneurship made him suffer academically. Eventually, he did form a team through personal contacts and built his company in Noida instead of incubating at SIIC. To ease the process of starting up a company (deriving the motivation from his own journey), he developed Pnapaao, a company that helps budding startups in all ways possible- team formation, marketing, and consulting. Pnapaao has grown to be a steady venture and is on its way to becoming a successful startup now.",
      "A few entrepreneurs at IITK do get on the path to success and realize their ambitions. We also talked to Tanmay Yadav, an IITK alumnus and a successful entrepreneur to know more about his struggles as well as his journey to establish CRUBN.",
      "As a freshman, Tanmay was fascinated by the idea of blockchains, which came with its own set of challenges. Being a student from a non-CSE background, pursuing software engineering was a cumbersome task, meanwhile, there were no courses on blockchain technology being offered at that time. After some self-learning through online courses, Tanmay approached Prof. Sandeep Shukla for a project where he learned more about the various aspects of blockchains and how they could create an impact on society. Joined by Mukul,(Co-founder and Managing Director, CRUBN) who was also working under Prof Shukla at the time, he participated in a Microsoft Hackathon and devised a solution to the given problem statement, which eventually won the competition. This is how the journey of CRUBN began. The next task on hand was funding for which they went to Google and a few other places that also included some government organizations. They finally got funding from the National Security Council, providing them with a good corpus for their initiative. However, it wasn’t always smooth sailing, there were some roadblocks as well in his startup journey. One of the incidents that Tanmay vaguely recollects was when their team was working on a land records management problem using blockchain. They worked on the technology and spent nearly two years trying to pitch their idea to various state governments but it didn’t lead to fruition as the state administrations weren’t fully aware of the notion of blockchain back then. Continuing their research, they refined their model, looking at instances of the domain worldwide, and gave a final presentation to one of IITK’s alumni bureaucrats in Karnataka. However, soon after, covid hit the world. The company was founded on the 13th, and on the 21st of March 2020, a nationwide lockdown was unexpectedly declared. Suddenly, the whole world was battling covid, and everything else got sidelined. After a long halt for the company and the team, in December, they finally got a call from the same bureaucrat, discussing the possibility of them giving the presentation again. Thrilled, they prepared for the presentation which was scheduled for the very next day. Surprisingly, an hour before the meeting, it was declared in all the newspapers throughout Karnataka that IITK’s blockchain team would be doing land records management in Karnataka. And this was how CRUBN got its first project. Tanmay also mentions support from IITK as one of the building blocks to his success. He feels that SIIC and E-Cell are some of the bodies that do help budding startups but there is much more scope within policies and other domains that can be provided to help entrepreneurs.",
      "To know more about these provisions and policies as well as get a temperament of startup spirit and enthusiasm on campus, we interviewed Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, Professor-In-Charge (Incubation and Innovation). According to Prof. Bandhopadhyay, SIIC is the startup incubation center that helps budding entrepreneurs and provides them with the offices, mentors, and resources to get a headstart. The acceptance is based on the evaluation of the proposal submitted and an interview round held by a committee that also includes an expert faculty in the subject matter of the startup. A company is declared successful if it has been sustainable till five years of formation. The success rate of the startups incubated at SIIC is stated to be 59%.",
      "Despite this, many students do not incubate their companies at SIIC. Some of them had an issue with the equity demanded, which is vaguely stated in the contract as “mandatory 5% and extra”, the extra being decided by the committee on various criteria. Prof. Bandhopadhyay, in this regard, stated that “ If the student is taking advantage of the university by spending its resources or nurturing that company, it is fair that IIT Kanpur gets some share in the company hence it is well deserving”. On being asked about the lacking effort from the students’ end, Prof Bandhopadhyay highlighted that among students, the motivation for owning a business is more than that of solving a problem. Hence they tend to formulate a solution without identifying the problem and not the other way around.",
      "Despite the existence of SIIC, E-Cell, and multiple policies in place to support entrepreneurship, throughout the interview process, the issues that were raised by entrepreneurs were:",
      "Tanmay, commenting on these highlighted problems, recollects finding a team through the project he took up for blockchains. While for the academic load, he mentions that he had to complete his graduation in 7 semesters so that he could give more time to the company. Handling academics under such circumstances was not easy, and his CPI got affected as well. He focuses on the fact that handling academics and working on a startup simultaneously can be difficult. He advises entrepreneurial enthusiasts – “Going past the ideation phase is the most significant step for many people who are starting up. People should not hesitate to discuss their ideas with colleagues. You’ll find excellent people on campus who can give you very pragmatic criticism of your idea. The journey is not easy, but it’s very rewarding. KEEP FIGHTING AND KEEP THINKING. “",

      "In an email received by the residents of H6, the Warden In-Charge of Hall VI informed that she endorsed the recommendation of the outgoing HEC to cancel the elections for the post of President, Hall 6, and that renominations would be sought when elections are conducted at a later date (post 15 March).[1]",
      "The outgoing President of H6 claimed that both the candidates contesting for President, H6 were severely under-prepared. For example, she recounted that one of the candidates did not know who the hall warden was during the soapbox, while the other named the hall manager when asked. Based on multiple such instances, the Warden In-Charge, in consultation with the HEC, decided to not have the elections with such a low level of preparation and instead give the candidates more time to prepare.",
      "The President also claimed that there were far too many similarities between the manifestos of the Hall VI and Hall V HEC candidates (where HEC elections were recently concluded). She further added that there were eerie similarities between the manifestos of the two candidates as well – for example, both of them had coincidentally forgotten to include any plans on festivities, cultural activities and hall day, but included them in the budget.[2][3]. The President alleged that it was the CEO’s (Chief Election Officer, H6 Elections) responsibility to look at these issues during ratification of manifestos but they were overlooked.",
      "According to the Chief Election Officer (CEO) for H6 HEC elections, the two presidential candidates were ‘unfairly’ accused by the outgoing HEC, of plagiarising manifestos of Hall 5 HEC candidates and were repeatedly asked to take back their nominations. When the candidates did not comply, the Hall President called one of them to her room and asked her to step down for reasons such as going for a summer internship and not having a good enough CPI, alleged one of the candidates.",
      "The CEO claimed that after the soapbox, the HEC asked her to shift the polling day. When she did not comply, an HEC member screamed at her and forced her to make the change. This was reverted back to the original date once the Students’ Gymkhana intervened.",
      "When asked for comment, the Hall President told us, “The HEC discussed that the candidates got only 2 days for campaigning – on one of which most of them had an exam, so they should be given another day for campaigning. Since we did not find any rule against this in the Code of Conduct, we approached the CEO with this proposal. The CEO of H6 elections had initially agreed to send out an email, but later reneged after talking to the CEO of the Election Commission. When we appointed a CEO, we placed trust in her, but when we realised that she was being unduly influenced by a senior, the scenario changed.”",
      "It may be noted that the CEO of the Election Commission was the proposer of one of the candidates. The outgoing President believes this shouldn’t have been allowed at the time of filing nominations, but the CEO of H6 elections overlooked this as well.",
      "As a last resort, the HEC approached the Warden In-Charge and recommended that the elections for the post of President be cancelled. The CEO and the candidates were not made aware of this and only got to know of the cancellation once they received the email.",
      "After the email was sent, the CEO met the Warden to ask for the rationale behind cancelling the elections. The Warden allegedly said that the candidates were ‘ill-prepared’ and hence, she was giving them more time to prepare. Vox team contacted the warden to confirm the statement and ask for a comment. However, we did not receive a reply by the time of publication.",
      "Both the presidential candidates have denied copying from Hall 5 HEC manifestos and further asserted that their manifestos were ratified by the CEO (Chief Election Officer).",
      "“I believe such scrapping of elections is extremely undemocratic because if we were genuinely incapable of winning the elections, then NOTA would have prevailed. That decision should be taken by the GBM and not the HEC. If they just want the person they like to be the next president, then why hold elections at all? Just take interviews”, one of the candidates told us.",
      "Several questions need to be confronted in this regard: What should be the extent of involvement or influence of the outgoing HEC during HEC elections? Are they supposed to make value judgment on the under-preparedness of the candidates? Or is it for the GBM (General Body Members) to decide if the candidates are good enough? Even if the candidates are under-prepared, is it under the HEC’s or Warden’s mandate to call off the elections, without the consent of the Chief Election Officer?",
      "Vox opines that the incident in Hall 6 points to the sheer disregard of the democratic spirit of elections. It, moreover, sets a dangerous precedent for the years to come because",
      "(a) Arbitrary justifications may be used against candidates disfavoured by the outgoing HEC",
      "(b) The Warden assumed the authority to cancel the elections without consulting the Chief Election Officer of the Hall or giving the candidates a chance to disagree.",

      "The Hall Of Residence 13 is the first stay for first-year undergraduate males at IITK since the year 2018. With an entirely new world awaiting students and a hall of residence entirely for the first-year male students being in place, the state of living conditions and the resident experience has been far from pleasant as per its current residents. Being homed amid the spread of litter and below-par drinking water facilities, regular HC visits, and trouble from mosquitoes; the added unresponsive authorities have left the Y22 boys reeling by the end of their first semester. Residents of the IITK campus frequently talk about the dormitories’ overcrowding, rising electricity costs, and crumbling ceilings in the old halls of IITK. However, the mismanagement inside Hall 13 is rarely brought up. At Vox, we decided to bring this up and floated a survey to gauge the opinions of Hall 13 residents.",
      "Investigating the quality of potable water and also assessing feedback from our survey, we found that an wide majority of 65% of respondents found the water quality to be unsatisfactory. Analysing these responses block-wise, the proportion of students unsatisfied was much higher in blocks A, D, E and F. This comes as an expected consequence as blocks B and C had new RO systems installed in November last year. Assessing the water quality using a TDS meter ourselves in the hall, our team found the following results as of mid-January.",
      "The investigation highlights how adequate potable drinking water sources are not just limited in number, but also scattered across the entire hall. This causes students to line up at a water cooler for longer durations and also travel across the hall for something as essential as drinking water. The numbers can also be contrasted with our last investigation on water quality across the campus which is linkedhere",
      "Students also complained about high salt concentration in water supplied to the washrooms and raised concerns of several dermatological problems arising from this. Suggestions for the adoption of water softeners were also made. Apart from the water issue, complaints of a general lack of hygiene in and around the hall, including an ever-increasing garbage pile on the side lanes of the hall, found numerous mentions in the survey responses.",
      "Hygiene in the messing facilities was also raised as a concern among the student residents. Problems like fly infestation, hair found in mess food and improperly cleaned utensils were pressing issues with the messing in Hall 13. Students also mentioned their dissatisfaction at the quality of food served in the mess and in particular were unhappy with the high prices of extras in the mess, claiming that the amount of food being served was not proportional to the price paid.",
      "Presence of bugs and snakes within the hall premises was also a concern flagged across the survey responses. The presence of dogs, however was not posed as an issue, with around 81% residents being neutral or having no problem with the presence of dogs. Problems arose with toppling of garbage by dogs and further consequences like foul odour and spread of other diseases was highlighted.",
      "Around 79% of students mentioned about having visited the Health Centre atleast once. Out of this, 44% mentioned that they had been to the HC on more than one instance. 72% students had fevers at least once through their stay, and while symptoms of COVID, Dengue and Chicken Pox were low, around 50% of the residents faced digestive disorders during some or the other part of their stay yet.",
      "Regarding the number of washing machines in the hall, more than 60% of the students felt that it should be increased, and 22% were unsatisfied with the availability of warm water. On the brighter side, more than half of the students were satisfied with the availability of warm water in the hostel, and more than 85% of students didn’t face the problem of power cuts. Pingala complaints were addressed in time for the majority, though 16% of the respondents complained about delayed or no response.",
      "Creation of a Hall Executive Committee for Hall 13 has been a long pending task, and the survey highlighted how 60% residents were in favour of having an HEC for the hall to enable student administration for the living conditions and facilities of the hall. The Senate and CoSHA had approved the formation of the HEC back in 2020-21, but pertaining to the pandemic, the implementation of the same was stalled. While news of elections for the HEC to be held around March are doing the rounds, conclusive updates are yet to be received.",
      "The infrastructure crunch plaguing the campus currently has taken all shapes and forms, with the most recent Hall of Residence also facing concerns related to living conditions coming up. The necessity of having proper student accommodation gets highlighted with each passing week on campus, and having students take up responsibility to handle the facilities provided to them in the proper adept manner comes forward as a necessary step. With the end of the first semester for the Y22 undergraduates, the updates with their stay at Hall 13 are awaited upon their return to campus. Keep following us for more follow-ups on the issue!",

      "We would like to express our gratitude to Prof. Rajat Mittal, Prof. Abhas Singh, and Mr. Hari Shankar, who generously gave their time and provided us with crucial information. Without their input, this article would not have been possible. We extend our sincere thanks to each of them for sharing their expertise, perspectives, and experiences, which greatly enriched the content of this article.",
      "Of the many significant features of a culture, a central one is how it handles the tension between purity and pollution. The distinction between ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’, is a consequence of the more fundamental distinction between ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’. The culture makes this duality known through its rituals, practices and attitudes. More importantly, it manifests itself in our relationship to what we consider ‘waste’.",
      "We wish to inquire further into this idea. The notion that waste simply disappears from our perceptual reality – Leftover mess-food, coca-cola bottles, and chips packets – where do they disappear? Why must we ask this question? How are these concerns relevant to us as residents of a huge campus?",
      "IIT Kanpur produces nearly 1.5 metric tonnes of waste from hostels every day, in addition to 350-400 kg of household waste. Our Campus, for all practical purposes, is a miniature township. Discarded waste by the community, leftover food from halls and eateries, debris from infrastructure projects, sludge from sewage treatment plants, refuse from horticulture activities and hazardous waste from laboratories – all of these require an elaborate and sustainable mechanism of waste management. To understand how our campus manages all of this waste, we must first understand the different types of waste generated on campus, and where they come from.",
      "The waste generated on campus can be broadly classified into the following –",
      "(1) Biodegradable Waste – This is primarily generated in hostel messes and the residential area of the campus. In hostel messes, biodegradable waste is generated when food is wasted by the students, the surplus food is thrown away and other organic waste is generated during the preparation of food. There are around 1200 houses in the residential area of the campus which not only generate biodegradable waste, a substantial amount of non-biodegradable and a tiny amount of hazardous waste.",
      "(2) Non-Biodegradable Waste – This is generated in residential areas, hostel wing dustbins and public dustbins around campus. All kinds of plastic waste like packets,  wrappers and pens, metallic waste and glass come under non-biodegradable waste.",
      "(3) Horticulture Waste – Waste such as grass, fallen leaves and branches, dead plants are called horticulture waste.",
      "(4) Hazardous Waste – This includes broken glass, tube lights and light bulbs, medicines, batteries, electronic waste etc. Hazardous waste is generated in residential areas as well as hostels but in a relatively smaller amount. Waste under this category cannot be dumped anywhere. If this comes in contact with water, several toxins are leached out which further percolate into the groundwater reserves.",
      "(5) Lab and Hospital Waste – This includes various kinds of chemical and medical waste generated in labs and in the health centre. For example, corrosive and reactive chemicals, used syringes and needles, infectious waste, etc. This category of waste requires special treatment before getting discarded.",
      "Waste management in our institute, therefore, is the co-responsibility of the administration – through systemic measures and technologies, and of the student residents – through conscious waste disposal. The pathetic state of waste management can be seen in heaps of litter around eateries and daily-extravagant wastage of mess food. Let us look at these separately, and in detail.",
      "Our campus, for a very long time, was located on the outskirts of the city. Although the city over the decades has caught up, the institute had to develop and maintain their own services because the municipal services were not available to them. Hence, there are systems in place where each category of waste, as described earlier, is subject to different processes.",
      "(1) Biodegradable Waste – A method called ‘drum composting’ is carried out to deal with biodegradable waste. The technology is called BHOOMI-the automated drum composting machine. was developed in IIT Kanpur itself in 2017 as a result of an experiment carried out by Prof. Abhas Singh and a PhD student Mr. Hari Shankar. This was implemented in residential areas and hostels in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Drum composting reduced the time taken for composting from 40-50 days to less than 17 days. This reduced the cost and increased the productivity of the composting process. The compost formed is used as organic manure for horticulture purposes. Currently, there are 16 drum composting sites on campus and around 1.5 tonnes of biodegradable waste is generated everyday on campus.",
      "Before the invention of BHOOMI, the waste was taken by a contractor who segregated waste and carried out manual composting. When the erstwhile contractor stopped operations, there was no other contractor to turn to for a long time. During this time, the non-segregated waste was dumped in the ground near the Shilbi gate. The locals used to burn the waste during winter.",
      "(2) Non-Biodegradable Waste – The institute has hired a company called J.T.N. Services to collect the non-biodegradable waste from residential areas, hostel wing dustbins, and public dustbins. The collected waste is then dumped by the company in the designated nagar nigam landfills.",
      "(3) Horticulture Waste – This is collected in tractors and dumped in various empty places around campus where people do not go often.",
      "(4) Hazardous Waste – This is collected from households every second Saturday at the new shopping complex by a contractor. There is no separate way of collecting this waste from hostels; thus, it is entirely up to the students to ensure that hazardous waste does not end up mixing with other kinds of waste.",
      "(5) Lab and Health-Centre Waste – There is a unit near the airstrip in which waste of this kind is stored. When enough waste accumulates, a contractor is called. The contractor then takes the waste to a treatment plant. On the other hand, liquid chemical waste in labs is discarded in the sinks which ends up damaging pipes.",
      "In their formative years, the state of the physical environment students live in has a profound and impressionable impact on how they view the world. It is not without reason that most acclaimed higher education institutes in our country and abroad, have lush green and spacious campuses. IITs were envisioned to “set the trends in environmental upkeep of an organized human habitation and to serve as role models for the townships to emulate.” Ideally, in premier institutes like the IITs- stakeholders are supposed to be in harmony with their environment, become sensitive to it and make conscious efforts to keep it clean and sustainable. However, the status-quo shows us a different picture.",
      "Each mess in our campus functions as a  “community kitchen” where the cost of food is borne equally by all residents irrespective of their individual consumption. This means, the cost of wastage too is divided equally between all – so there emerges an ethical, community aspect to our participation in the mess.",
      "In contrast, food purchased in the canteens, or ‘extras’ in the mess for that matter, are almost never leftover, because students pay directly and immediately for what they consume. This lack of tangible accountability, along with an acute absence of community consciousness, normalize the reckless wastage of food. Everyday, we come across sights of plates full of food, completely discarded. The effort to not waste food is minimal – take only as much or less than what you want to eat. Why, then, is wastage so rampant? Another aspect of this attitude makes itself visible in the heaps of litter outside campus eateries, in hostel corridors and outside canteens. One finds garbage everywhere around the dustbin on more than one occasion. Similar is the case with food on our mess plates. Since we see no immediate individual stake in wastage, what happens to the food later hardly demands our attention.How do we combat this attitude? To start with, by making a conscious effort to challenge our default logic and voluntarily assuming the role of the ‘responsible resident’.Student bodies like the HEC have to take initiative to set up constant reminders in and around the mess so that students are continually made aware of their responsibilities to the community.",
      "(1) Every hall can possibly start by having a waste management secretary and some volunteers. This helps by having individuals responsible for the following systems:",
      "(i) Segregation of waste is the first step in the process of waste management. Segregating at source is the most effective way of doing it. A hall is autonomous so the secretary of the hall can talk to their waste collector, ask about the hall’s waste management and plan the process of segregation accordingly.",
      "(ii) Every wing must have two dustbins, one for biodegradable waste and the other for non-biodegradable waste. They should make sure that the collection of biodegradable waste is done in drums followed by composting. For non-biodegradable waste, there can be a few dustbins where the waste will be collected and stored. The waste can be collected once a month.",
      "(iii) Medicinal and hazardous waste can be collected once a month in every hall so that it can be treated properly in the treatment plant.",
      "(2)Use of single-use plastics must be eliminated in a phased manner",
      "(3)A waste management committee consisting of students, professors and staff must be formed. It will be convenient to have a forum for raising issues and having important discussions of waste management around campus.",
      "In conclusion, premier institutes like IIT Kanpur, as technically advanced communities, have a unique opportunity to lead the way in developing and implementing sustainable waste management practices. By implementing the measures, we as a community can not only reduce our environmental footprint and improve public health but also, more importantly, set an example for others across the country to follow. Along with our contribution to solving contemporary global issues of solid waste management, we arguably have a moral duty and an ethical responsibility to pay attention to this issue and take the necessary steps.",

      "Following an Office Order by the Director’s Office dated 22 August 2022, a committee was constituted to review the current accommodation status of students and suggest measures to improve the same. What follows is an editorial by Vox Populi in collaboration with the Forum for Critical Thinking on the recommendations made by the committee.",
      "When the pandemic subsided and students were recalled back to campus, a concern that came up was housing the increasing number of students. With Y20 and Y21 students joining the institute, the difficulties in frequent shifting and crunched living conditions were overshadowed by the first offline campus experience. After over a year of the campus reopening and with the Y22 undergraduate batch joining, the state of affairs hasn’t improved much.",
      "In the latter half of the previous year, the administration formed a committee to review the accommodation issue and suggest possible measures to relieve the situation. As of today, the campus houses around 9,000 students. However, the number of rooms available is in the vicinity of the number 6,100 and beds in totality are around 7,100. This crunch, directly and indirectly, affects the entire campus community.",
      "The committee comprised six professors and two student nominees – the President, Students’ Gymkhana and a PG nominee. While the report itself is attached towards the end of the article, the headings of the report can be briefly summarised below:",
      "The committee recognises that the Halls of Residence (which include the rooms, washrooms, mess, and water supply) are designed to accommodate a certain number of students and that there are no guidelines to define the maximum limit of overload in student accommodation a hostel can sustain. A single room in Hall 1 is recommended to be taken as a standard single room accommodation to specify the overcapacity limits of each hostel and be agreed upon. The committee also mentions that ideally, all halls must strive towards having no crunch in the halls over and above the designed capacity.",
      "The committee recommends that the Institute review the current policy of linking accommodation to admission (which makes IITK a residential campus) and delink Institute accommodation from admission. A change in the residential nature of the IITK campus would imply several dire consequences. Over the years, the student residents on campus have shaped many policy decisions. They have also taken up positions to formulate plans for functioning in a massive community like ours at IIT Kanpur. Facilities like messing, security and safety, electricity and water supply, internet connectivity and academic facilities make the campus a place to foster its residents’ physical, mental and social development. De-linking accommodation from admission would imply that students would have to look for housing and other arrangements outside the campus and travel to and from each day. Apart from this, such an arrangement would also introduce a divide among the student community and alienate students from each other who come from varying socio-economic backgrounds. This also raises the question of what happens to existing residential halls on campus. What happens to campus workers who are employed in each of these halls? While the recommendation by the committee appears very succinct, a deeper analysis of why this policy change is prudent needs to be included.",
      "The recommendation to delink accommodation vis-a-vis academic status can be summarised as per the table below:",
      "An important thing to note is that such a policy only partially solves the crunch issue for some. While the campus is short of close to 2000 beds, only 360 rooms are occupied by PG and PhD students residing in hostels and SBRA/NRA residences which have completed the normal duration for their degrees. Assuming an equal number of degree-extended UG students, only 720 additional rooms would be available, which falls drastically short of the requisite 2000 beds that our campus requires. Also, the recommendation recognises that the normal duration of the programme is more than or equal to the minimum residence time but sets restrictions on the kind of accommodation right after the minimum residence time, implying in some sense that any degree extended student has to suffer through crunch accommodation during the extension consequently.",
      "The committee recommends more hostels be built to address the needs of the increased student population.",
      "",
      "In response to certain concerns raised by the PG community, the President, Students’ Gymkhana responded that the since the report does not mention a timeline and is only a set of recommendations, any action related to hostel decrunching would only be taken by a separate implementation committee and that these recommendations would only be considered as reference and would be consulted with regards to the then prevailing conditions. It was also stated that this report considered the completion of Hall 14 by August 2023 for the next academic semester, which is now further delayed. A CoSHA meeting on 14 December 2022 also raised the concern of increasing crunch. The same was to be taken up in an HMC meeting next month.",
      "The recommendations of this report shed light on some glaring concerns and also point to what might be in store for the student community on campus. While the President, Students’ Gymkhana commented that signatures on such a report do not amount to any actions regarding the hostel crunch issue, compliance with such recommendations is still a matter of grave concern since the recommendations do not account for the students’ interest at large. The delay in the construction of new hostels and the tenacity with which the institute has taken up efforts in other construction projects highlights the non-seriousness and lack of accountability to the students with regard to their accommodation situation. Despite knowing that the student strength would increase year-on-year, the construction of the hostels has taken place at an abominably slow pace, with no concrete updates regarding the completion of projects. We at Vox believe that the committee’s recommendations have not been thought through and analysed. Implementing these would have radical consequences on the student community and the campus culture and should thus be taken back promptly.",

      "While on the one hand we see a recurrent narrative about the inequality in college cutoffs, internships and placements; on the other hand are apprehensions about casual sexism, unwarranted doubts about one’s competence and jeopardised opportunities. Buried under this chaos are also the unheard complaints of the non-binary for whom even acknowledgement of their problems – keep aside resolution – seems to be an uphill task.",
      "Vox team conducted an anonymous survey to dive deep into the issue and know what the campus thinks. The survey received 494 responses, with about 75% male, 22% female, and 3% non-binary responses. To present the complete picture on the issue, we talked to the Women’s Cell, alumni, Gymkhana executives and a few individuals who reached out to us with their cases. Here are the findings from the survey and our conversations:",
      "A significant portion of the male respondents raised concerns regarding the reservation for female students at colleges and alleged that females are favoured by TAs and tutors. The woes of disadvantages of female favouritism extended to club recruitment and company hiring as well. Furthermore, about 40% males found the Women’s Cell unapproachable, according to our survey. Some comments that supported these notions were:",
      "Multiple respondents alleged lack of cognizance in cases of harassment of boys. Invasion of personal space in hostels and the shame associated with pointing it out were some common issues. Further, respondents expressed disappointment regarding the lack of support from the Women’s Cell in such cases.",
      "Moreover, the male population overwhelmingly believed that the Women’s Cell is biassed towards females. Many respondents expressed that they are vulnerable to being subjected to false implications through the Women’s Cell.",
      "A few male respondents were also cognizant of the difficulties faced by their female friends. They highlighted how sometimes sexism was a common element across male-only groups.",
      "In response to why they felt the campus has prevalent sexism, many female respondents shared that they regularly confront sexist comments and remarks. Comments like“You’ll definitely get a job”,“Hall 6 won only because boys helped them”and“You got here because you were a girl”made them feel inferior and unworthy.",
      "",
      "Multiple female students shared with us instances wherein the Gymkhana, the Senate or particular coordinators of certain clubs believed that girl students are incompetent of leading. In particular, respondents alleged that girls applying for festival coordinators are reasoned off by saying that the vendors won’t listen to a girl.",
      "",
      "Another female student we talked to alleged the current President, Students’ Gymkhana for passing sexist remarks casually. She told us,",
      "Both male and female students also pointed out cases of some Professors passing sexist remarks in classes. In one such incident, a Professor said, “In developed countries, women work and take care of their physical appearance. Housewives in India are not only fat but also ugly and spend their entire day watching TV serials.” He also went on to say that a female sanitary worker in the western world looks better than bollywood heroines. Many respondents felt these remarks were not only sexist but also made them uncomfortable.",
      "",
      "Incidents like these, especially involving people in positions of power, show how deeply rooted sexism is in our ‘culture’. However, it must also be noted that around 32% of girls feel that the campus is not sexist.",
      "",
      "Another serious concern raised by the female community was uncomfortable behaviour of guys in front of them. Many girls told us that it is challenging to have a neutral conversation with a boy as most seem driven by obscure intentions. Unnecessary attention that girls receive was disturbing for multiple respondents.",
      "",
      "On the issue of alleged favouritism of females at IITK, some respondents found it vital so as to encourage more women to get opportunities in STEM. The same was said for club recruitment.",
      "In the survey, non-binary conforming gender responses constituted 3% of the responses received. Out of them, 50% felt unsafe expressing their gender identity on campus.",
      "",
      "Despite conducting several gender identity sensitisation sessions to promote healthy interactions in the campus community, athird of the respondents affirmed that there were incidents where people mocked them for their identity. They felt that their gender identity posed a problem in campus interactions and during internship and placement drives. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that they were at a disadvantage because they did not conform to any of the binary genders.",
      "",
      "Another concern that came up recurrently in our investigation echoed here: The name Women’s Cell for a gender-neutral support body was alienating for many.",
      "The Chairperson, Students’ Senate, agreed that sexism existed in many subtle forms on the campus. For example, he pointed out that many clubs were not ready to take rooms in the Girls’ Hostels merely because they found it inconvenient. While in contrast, many clubs have their rooms in boys’ hostels.",
      "",
      "Kartikeya Dhakad, the ex-Chairperson Students’ Senate, also noted that the location of clubs’ and teams’ rooms in the boys’ hostels, especially those of the SnT council, impedes female participation due to reduced accessibility.",
      "",
      "To better understand the scenario, our team analysed the participation of students in Councils and the Senate. Based on the ratification list, female students made less than a quarter of the ratified position holders across councils, Senate and festivals. In particular, SnT Council, Students’ Senate and Festivals fared worse than other student bodies. It may however be noted that the following data is based on the ratification lists, which does not entirely capture how many females and males actually participated in club/fest activities.",
      "Multiple executives pointed out that one of the primary reasons for the reduced female participation in the Senate and Councils is the lack of culture and exposure within the Girls’ Hostels.",
      "Kartikeya (ex-Chairperson, Students’ Senate) however pointed out that the low percentages in the Senate could be a one-time event, and we might see an increase in the future. He emphasised that the quality of people participating in a particular election is crucial in determining female participation in the Senate. He shared how during his tenure, some people were against the appointment of a female Chief Election Officer. He recounts hearing:“Vo ladki hai, voh ese decisions le hi nahi sakti kabhi”. \nOn questions on the Women’s Cell and the need for a gender cell, Kartikeya responded that adiversity cell existsalthough it is dysfunctional.",
      "",
      "To fact-check the recurrent narrative about girls being favoured over boys during internship and placement seasons, we analysed the internship and placement data (for Phase 1 in 2022-23). We found that the female to male recruitment ratio was 1:3.5. To put it in perspective, the female to male population ratio in IITK is about 1:4.28.",
      "Some of the recent alumni we talked to said that the narrative is created because some companies tend to ‘overcompensate’ for the lack of women in core engineering fields. Additionally, they said the issue is hyped by the people who are not selected and tend to find loopholes.",
      "To know the Women’s Cell’s perspective, our team talked to Professor Sarani Saha, the current Chairperson, Women’s Cell and Professor Jonaki Sen, the ex-Chairperson, Women’s Cell. They pointed out that sexism is prevalent in all stratas of the society, and the student community at IITK is no different. We are supposed to put our father/husband’s names in almost all government forms – this, they said, is an example of the systemic nature of the issue.",
      "",
      "Prof. Jonaki Sen had this to say when asked about the cause of such prevalent sexism on campus:",
      "On the significant lack of female participation in SnT and GnS councils compared to AnC and MnC councils, Prof. Sarani Saha suggested that this could stem from societal biases that women are better suited for specific roles and activities opposed to others. The skewed gender ratio in such councils could also act as a deterrent to their participation. She highlights that healthy participation is required for gender-inclusive policy formation and increased gender sensitisation. Further, in any setup, an individual feels more inclined to engage if there are companions and role models that they can relate to.",
      "",
      "We also talked to the professors about how supernumerary seats, lenient cutoffs for girls and diversity hiring in internships and placements contribute to the prejudice that girls are not at par with boys or are inferior. Prof. Jonaki Sen claimed that such policies are required to patch the ‘leaky pipeline’ and improve female representation. By ‘leaky pipeline’, she referred to the gradual reduction (or ‘leakage’) in the number of female students from undergrad to PhD levels and further in faculty positions.",
      "",
      "However, Prof. Sen said that such policies need to be implemented with a grain of salt. She believed that the benefits of such policies should be limited to first-generation college-going females. Suppose the mother is already doing well professionally; in that case, the daughter probably should not be allowed to avail of the policies to the same extent.",
      "",
      "On the issue of perceived bias of the Women’s Cell in favour of the women (as apparent from our survey), Prof. Jonaki Sen clarified that as an awareness wing, the Women’s Cell caters to the needs of students across all genders and sexuality. And that Women’s Cell is meant solely for females is a misconstrued idea. Furthermore, she clarified that a harassment rule mandates equal privilege in approaching the ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) for both males and females in cases of harassment. Prof. Sarani Saha, welcomed the idea of renaming the Women’s cell to a more gender-neutral name and said that the cell would consider the same.",
      "As per our survey, the major deterrent in approaching Women’s Cell were prevalent reputation about the inaction of Women’s Cell in major cases and the risk of the victim’s identity being revealed. To this, Prof. Sarani Saha responded, “In my tenure as an ICC member (Internal Complaints Committee) for three years, I have seen complaints being treated with utmost urgency – barring the COVID-induced delays in procedures. This happens because we work on a deadline to close complaints within three months of filing.”",
      "Thereby, she said that the reservations about the inefficiency of the Women’s Cell and the ICC are unwarranted. Moreover, she claimed that the confidentiality of the victim’s identity is respected throughout the process and stressed on the dire need for victims to complain as it sets a precedent for the accused.",
      "Prof. Jonaki Sen told us that the number of complaints of sexual harassment has gone up, which shows that more people are cognizant of the importance of speaking up. “This is a massive milestone for Women’s Cell as an educating body. To improve the effectiveness of sessions, the Cell is also planning to hold cognisance sessions department-wise,” she added.",
      "",
      "According to both the faculty members, the biggest challenge for the Women’s Cell is the abysmal participation of campus residents in the awareness sessions organised. Prof. Sen suggested making attendance compulsory for students as well as faculty members in department-wise awareness sessions. Prof. Sarini Saha highlighted the use of social media to gain more traction and plans to use it to create greater awareness on such issues.",
      "In conclusion, the question of sexism on campus is nuanced and multi-faceted. Measures taken in the name of fighting sexism are often seen as sexist by the other side. But two things are clear from our study: one, our merit island is far from ideal – sexism is deeply rooted in our campus community; two, we need more public conversation around sexism. For we are still seeking consensus on crucial questions like: is reservations for females or diversity hiring sexism or anti-sexism? Are ideas of ‘representation’ and ‘equality’ opposite ends to a spectrum or consistent with each other?",

      "Disclaimer: The following article’s content is comprised of excerpts quoted from the current Post-graduate Academic Review Committee (PGARC) Report, 2020-21. As per a note mentioned within the report, all recommendations and data used have been for pre-pandemic conditions, and the effect or considerations arising out of the pandemic are beyond the scope of the present report.",
      "The first academic review of the PG Programme (PGP) was presented to the Academic Senate in December 2012 amid growing emphasis in the Institute on the centrality of the PGP. The latest review is thus the Second PG Academic Review. The report was prepared by a panel of members that included: Prof. Amitabha Bandopadhyay, Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava, Prof. Nisant N. Nair, Prof. Parasar Mohanty, Prof. Prashant Bagad, Prof. Sameer Khandekar, Prof. Sarani Saha, Prof. Sri Vanamalla V., Mr Vineeth Vijayan (Student Representative), and Prof. Yashowanta N. Mohapatra (Chair).",
      "For this article, we have mentioned a few impactful introductions, set out as recommendations or suggestions in the report, made by this committee with an aim to make PGP more student-friendly and meticulous, like most elite and recognized higher education programmes across the globe.",
      "Proposal to set-up PGFC",
      "A PG student typically comes from a different academic set-up and is often left bewildered by the organizational structure and flow of decisions and the stress of academic rigour. Discontent among students has been noted that has led to the propagation of a perception that the system is unresponsive towards problems of PG students. This shall become more acute as the Institute aims to considerably increase the size of PGP, which currently stands at approximately 40 per cent of the total strength.",
      "To resolve this issue, PGARC recommends setting up a Post-graduate Facilitation Centre (PGFC). The Centre shall be headed by an experienced faculty member or an eminent educationist and aided by a team consisting of one designated DPGC member from each Department and a PG representative of the Student’s Senate. The basic functions of PGFC will broadly include the following:",
      "i) Arranging professional support required by groups of students in improving language skills outside the formal course structure, communication skills in navigating careers, software and data analysis skills, and so on.",
      "ii) Coordinating outreach efforts of Departments to project PGP in digital media space (interviews with faculty and students, short films, etc.), social media, organizing events celebrating student experience through achievements in publishing papers, attending conferences, or innovative projects of a similar kind, maintaining helpdesks manned by students (as a part of their TA work) to direct students seeking help, and providing support to international students in consultation with International Relations Cell.",
      "Addressing Coursework Inadequacies",
      "It has been observed that Departments/IDPs are struggling to be able to offer enough courses to the satisfaction of students, especially for Master’s Programmes. Sometimes even compulsory courses are being joggled around in semesters due to the lack of a critical number of faculty in the Programme or Stream. This is a serious academic concern, and the need for interdisciplinary courses (compulsory or electives IDC/IDE) designed especially for PG students across Departments have been voiced. PGARC supports theintroduction of interdisciplinary courses. It encourages all Departments/IDPs to participate in at least one IDC annually, especially those that are offering different versions for similar content.",
      "A need for a Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies which spearheads the design and development of such courses is an issue that the Departments can discuss and then address accordingly. It has also been suggested to Departments that supervisors shouldallow students in engineering and science a course in HSSat an appropriate level as an AE if the candidate wishes so (keeping in view constraints of workload and progress). However, this course may be allowed only after the concerned student has passed the Comprehensive Examination successfully.",
      "With the fast-changing pace of knowledge boundaries, the doctoral programme, in which a student spends more than four years, must have the opportunity to continue formal learning even after all course requirements are over. Such opportunities can be made available to interested students through a 4-week long, 3-credit course capsule consisting of 12 lectures and 2 hours of testing or equivalent evaluation. TheSpecial Topic Course Capsule (STCC)can be offered by a visiting professor, a special invitee, or a faculty member.",
      "Further,recommendations to Senatefor considering adoption on the Institute level have been stated as well. These include:",
      "i) Introduction of a zero-credit PG Seminar Course (at least for one semester for M.Tech. and two semesters for PhD students) in which PG students attend seminars given by students under the mentorship of a faculty. This shall increase the breadth of knowledge and awareness of current trends in the discipline while improving communication skills.",
      "ii) The Department is advised to offer their doctoral students a course covering topical issues relevant to the profession and the disciplinary community, along with communication skills in writing and oral presentation. The communication skills module may be offered at the Institute level, and the introduction to profession module should be offered by the Department.",
      "Academic Performance: Inadequacy and Programme Termination Procedures",
      "The purely CPI-based criteria for identifying performance deficiency and termination has in large measure, resulted in structural ‘grade inflation’ across PGPs, instead of ensuring minimum quality standards in supposedly elite Programmes. In light of this, PGARC makes two recommendations:",
      "i) Introduction ofgranular grading: A+ (10/Outstanding); A (10/Excellent); B+ (09/B Plus); B (08/Good); C+ (07/C Plus); C (06/Fair); D+ (05/D Plus); D (04/Pass); E (02/Exposure); F (00/Fail); S: Satisfactory; X:Unsatisfactory; I: Incomplete (for internal usage before converting it to a valid letter grade on completion of evaluation components by the stipulated last date for submission of grades in a semester.(As per an email circulated before the beginning of the new semester, the granular grading system has been enforced on an institute level since 2022-23/I).",
      "ii) The currentminimum CPI criteria should be reduced to 6.5 for PhD Programmes, and 6.0 for Masters Programme. The revision of minimum CPI criteria should not be seen as a downgrading of standards but rather recalibration to protect the meaning of the standards the Institute seeks to adopt.",
      "Regarding the termination procedure, it has been recommended that the list of deficient students can be allowed to reply to a show-cause notice from the Convener, DPGC, after authorization from SPGC on the basis of the APEC report. SPGC be authorized to decide on a case-by-case basis considering the written and clearly argued recommendations of DPGC and Counselling Services. Only the Termination cases at that stage are brought to the Senate for consideration of mercy appeals.",
      "Milestones in Thesis Work",
      "PGARC makes the following set of recommendations to improve the quality ofPhD thesisand reduce the time taken to complete the degree:",
      "i)Open Seminar in 9th Semester(OS9S): this dictum or mantra should dictate all administrative policies, decision-making, and academic judgement at all levels. There are Departments in which currently the allotment of thesis supervisor is carried out after the Comprehensive Examination or the coursework is longer than three semesters. These Departments/IDPs need to critically review their doctoral programmes in the meantime so as to align with the policy of OS9S.",
      "ii) TheDoctoral Monitoring Committee(DMC) is now a mandated feature by the Senate. PGARC recommends that a DMC review meeting for a student need not be held at the end of the semester but at any time during it, with a constant gap between them in subsequent semesters. This would evenly distribute DMC meetings in a Department throughout the semester. The award of grades of thesis work remains the responsibility of the Thesis Supervisor as per the extant PG rules.",
      "iii) PGARC suggests that the Thesis Supervisor prepares the student forComprehensive ExamViva through several simulated sessions for them to understand the nature of the examination and expectations. Also, the Comprehensive Boards should provide a narrower pre-specified domain for preparation in view of the student’s coursework and foundations required for later work and career.",
      "iv) IntroducingThesis Work Plan: PGARC recommends that the student presents Version-1 of their broad work plan as a short document specifying the Thesis Work Plan (TWP) to the DMC within four months of finishing SOTA. The nature and style of the TWP is to be decided jointly by the Thesis Supervisor and the student. Keeping in view the work packages within the TWC, the period (between SOTA and Open) can be roughly divided into four achievement milestones (which can be changed as one progresses) which, when completed, will allow the student to deliver their Open Seminar.",
      "v) PGARC recommends that an online ‘PhD Student Status Dashboard’ be maintained for each student. This should contain essential information about PG Manual mandated milestones, due dates, completed dates, and achievements in Tabular form.",
      "vi)PhD exit options: M.Tech./MA/MS/MSR degree is proposed as the exit degree for PhD in all disciplines. A PhD student can opt for the exit option at any point of time in his/her PhD tenure after completing the required coursework. MTech/MA/MS/MSR thesis/project guide will be assigned by the DPGC Convener. A student failing in the comprehensive examination for two consecutive times may, on the recommendation of DPGC, shift to the exit track of the M.Tech./MA/MS/MSR programme. All PhD students in the exit track of a Master’s Programme be permitted, with the consent of the DPGC Convener, to participate in SPO placements any time after their fourth semester in the PhD programme.",
      "There is a need for stricter control at all stages of theMaster’s Thesis work,starting from articulating well-defined goals and the scope of the projects. Hence, PGARC makes the following suggestions and recommendations to the concerned departments:",
      "i) Prior to the supervisor assignment, projects with titles and a brief description of the scope must be floated on the basis of which students provide their options, or in other words, the students are assigned to projects floated. A certain fraction of students in each Department is allowed to opt for centrally floated projects by ambitious Institute level interdisciplinary research programmes.",
      "ii) The Master’s programme would improve if problems undertaken are shown to be directly related to the industry or are a part of industrial collaboration. In fact, for most such projects in the near future, the fellowship should or would be required to come from industry or be linked to the start-up ecosystem.",
      "iii) As an experimental measure, theBoard of Examiners for Master’s should, in its report, specify a quality tagsuch as Outstanding, Excellent, or Good with a brief justification. Only the Master thesis adjudged as outstanding or excellent can be nominated to the Awards Committee for consideration for any Institute-level award presented in Convocation.",
      "iv) If a student is not able to complete the requirements of a full thesis in the stipulated time as per the departmental norms, then the student can be offered an alternate degree, calledM.Tech. (with Project Report), as an exit option. The regular M.Tech. Degree certificate be referred to asM.Tech. (with Thesis). Delays in completion of M.Tech programme can be effectively controlled with this exit option.",
      "v) Currently, only 6% of the students in the MSR programme are sponsored by the projects, a serious anomaly for a programme explicitly targeted at project employees. To restore the original objectives of the programme, most of the students in this programme should be sponsored by projects or external organizations. To shift the intake of this programme in this direction, PGARC recommended that at least 50% of the seats filled in MSR admission in each department in a year must be against project funding. This percentage may be revised upwards by the Senate in 3-5 years to 75%.",
      "vi) PGARC recommends that the requirement of external review of the MSR thesis be removed, bringing its evaluation in line with current practice for M.Tech. thesis. This will improve the timeliness of thesis completion for such students, as well as avoid IPR conflicts that are very prevalent in more industry-centric research problems typically addressed by the project and externally funded MSR thesis.",
      "Tutorial and Teaching Assistantship",
      "PGARC recommends that the Departments should issue at the end of the doctoral programme atranscript-like(in a format uniform across all Departments)record of participation as Tutor, Teaching Assistant, or Academic Support(eg. website, library, help-desk services, etc.) listed under three different heads chronologically. The Department to which the student belongs should keep records for this purpose, possiblywith a quality tag of performance(such as Outstanding, Excellent, Good, etc) for internal usage. On the basis of the recommendation of a team of instructors,outstanding contributions to tutorial support or teaching assistantship can be recognized by a letter of appreciation from the HoD.",

      "Following from our previous survey piece, we interview and indulge in conversation with faculty members from the HSS department at IIT Kanpur to understand their motivations and the purview of the curriculum at our flagship engineering institute.",
      "IIT Kanpur was among the few institutes that heralded the crossover between sciences and humanities in India. Prof. Mini Chandran, in her welcome address posted on the HSS website, states the reason behind it: “With an intent to sharpen the creative talents of the students and to help them evolve as better leaders and decision-makers, the institute allocated more than fifteen per cent of the total UG course credits to HSS courses.”",
      "In what follows, we attempt to understand the nuances of this multi-layered statement to help our readers answer the question: Why does an engineering curriculum need humanities courses? This understanding will be developed through the perspective of faculty members while addressing the limitations of HSS courses owing to random course allotment.",
      "Limitations of the System",
      "Despite the positive impact of HSS courses on students, we still feel dissatisfaction brewing among them. In light of this observation, the question then shifts to the elephant in the room. We asked the survey respondents if there were anything else of importance they would like to share, and a repeated concern was theinefficiency of the lottery system.",
      "One of the primary reasons for this is that the need for a lottery system is not evident. It is not very transparent and is essentially a black box that spits out the course one should do without regarding the student’s choice, as suggested by the data in the survey. One argument for the lottery system is that some people are not interested in any HSS course, so they must be allotted a course. Even without the lottery system, such people would do HSS courses to satisfy credit requirements, thereby invalidating this argument. So we cannot say there isn’t merit in the students’ cries against the lottery system.",
      "To an extent, even the faculty members see and agree with this issue. Still, a resolution for it is not so easily sought. Prof. Braj Bhushan identified two significant problems with allowing students to take an HSS course of their choice. Firstly, how many courses can be offered? Each course requires infrastructure, a commitment that can’t be easily met. He points out a few intelligent solutions to this, like providing some courses online (the productivity of which will be a debatable issue) or having multiple parallel classes with multiple faculty members. Nevertheless, he also accepts that physical limitations constrain the institute from carrying out these solutions.",
      "Secondly, if the department is offering 25 courses (say), then a load of students per course should be equally distributed. Prof. AVR Sarma points out that maintaining a healthy teacher-student ratio in every course is important. This would not be easy to carry out if the choice was given preference, so, in his opinion, the lottery is the best system we can get under the circumstances. Apart from these practical problems, Prof. Bhushan agrees that ideally, students should be allowed to take a course of their choice as this would aid in the completion of minors and help them engage with disciplines with a newfound interest.",
      "From Knowledge to Wisdom",
      "With that background of evaluating the positives and negatives, we are now equipped to ponder on the big question.Why do we need HSS courses?One look at the effect that HSS courses have had on students gives us a place to start. The numbers speak for themselves, as noted in the previous article. Another way is to understand where the faculty members come from when teaching and designing HSS courses for technical students. What benefit do they think they can impart to the new generation?",
      "Prof. AVR Sarma, who takes up Logic and Philosophy of Science courses for undergraduates, states that he models his lessons to teach students the power of argumentation. The talent of IITK students sees them placed in high positions. When they have to deliver a pitch to investors or get a policy approved by superiors, their ability to communicate their point shouldn’t be flawed with logical inconsistencies or thwarted by the lack of context and critical thinking.",
      "Prof. Sarma understands some students’ disinterest in certain topics and tries to make up for it by introducing the subject through innovative pedagogy, like puzzles and paradoxes. He was a science student until his master’s and feels that moving to Philosophy helped him comprehend the world with a broader lens. He hopes to inculcate that perspective within his students so that they are humanised as leaders and try to look beyond short-term problems and solutions. An argument on similar lines can be made for courses in English that teach you about the relationship between fiction and reality and help you understand the ‘isms’ affecting modern thinking, among other things. In the future, if you wish to join think tanks, policy-making committees, and consultancies, having a grasp over such intricacies will make you a cut above the rest.",
      "Prof. Bhushan teaches introductory courses in Psychology and believes that HSS is the anchor of all subjects. His cross-disciplinary interests have allowed him to collaborate with researchers from multiple fields. This experience has led him to believe that humanities and social sciences help in weaving together the threads from other disciplines to tackle real-life problems efficiently. He illustrates his point with an example –",
      "Ageing as a biological process and how it affects the elderly is a part of sociology. The list of problems associated with it would include the likes of dementia and tremors. As a computer engineer, you can program a device that helps overcome the challenge of dementia. Still, you need to take a course in sociology to figure out the demographic details you wish to cater. Unless you have engaged in psychology courses, grasping dementia as a health issue with implications on the condition of living will be arduous. A similar understanding applies to helping patients with tremors which make it difficult for them to walk. A material science engineering student with a background in art and design is better equipped to develop an innovative, lightweight shoe material to help older adults affected by it to walk.",
      "To Sum Up",
      "Suppose one keeps studying technology and sciences without understanding how they can be used to better the human condition. In that case, it will defeat the purpose of education. Creative research is a product of the overall development IIT Kanpur plans for its students by allowing them to explore HSS courses. Life isn’t only about seeing things as they are but also about making meaning out of them, for which an all-round approach is of utmost importance. The takeaway from this article should be that humanistic inquiry is intricately tied with scientific investigations, and connecting these lines helps transform knowledge into wisdom.",

      "Tracing students’ opinions on the humanities curriculum at IIT Kanpur, and exploring the necessity for technology programs to have social science coursework.",
      "Several engineering students at IIT Kanpur often wonder – “why study Humanities courses?” especially when the alarm for early morning class jolts them out of sleep of which every minute feels oh so precious! From the perspective of a student who spent a couple or more years getting better at sciences to crack the JEE, this question seems genuine to a certain extent.",
      "Vox Populi decided to float a survey among the student body to assess and investigate potential answers to the above question, and got enthusiastic and insightful perspectives from the set of responses. The UG community proactively filled out the survey and had lots to say about the HSS courses offered,  grading schemes, pedagogies, and much more. Let us comb through the responses we received and see where they lead us.",
      "Understanding the Demographic",
      "First of all, who are the respondents? Even though the survey was sent out to all the students of IITK, all except one response was from the UG community. The lone data point was from a PhD student. An important metric to consider is how many HSS courses students have done.92.5% of all respondents have taken 1-4 courses, with the most prominent faction (35.4%) having done two courses. It is noteworthy that of all the courses done, more than 70% were taken – or rather given – through the lottery system. Nonetheless, people did have reasons to go with the courses they got or accepted, which is what we seek to examine next.",
      "Reasons for Taking HSS Courses",
      "Here we received answers that would already be coming to your mind. Three main reasons stand out: people take HSS courses out of interest, for grading, or the professor. Ideally, we want people to do courses they are interested in, and conversely, we want courses to interest people. However, it is concerning that less than half of the students taking HSS courses had felt that the course would be exciting or had consideredinterestswhile filling preferences. At the same time,at 42.2%, it is still the most cited reason for taking these courses, which is the good side of it. Nonetheless, it is evident that there is still a chasm between people’s interests and the courses they take.",
      "It has to be kept in mind that we can’t lay the blame on either the students or the HSS department. Some students might not pick courses that wouldn’t help them professionally, especially when the courses they can choose from are limited. Some might have had interests in a course but found themselves allotted a different one. Some courses might have failed to arouse interest in the students, while in some, other aspects such as teaching methods or grading schemes might have overweighed the students’ interests. Still, the influence of the interest factor going up is always a good thing.",
      "Let us next look at what is arguably the most discussed matter when the course-choosing season arrives, grading. In the survey, however,only 32% considered ease of getting good grades as one of the reasons for picking the courses they did. Adding to this is an interesting statistic – 35% of respondents were happy with their grades, while 12.6% were not pleased. Considering the amount of discussion around it, the ease of getting good grades stands among the less popular reasons for picking up a course. It might be that we overestimated how much the community values grades. Nevertheless, objectively speaking, we also have to consider the possibility that some students weren’t allotted the high-grading courses they preferred, driving down the percentage.",
      "Next,22.4% of the respondents cited having a “good” professor as a reason for picking a course. The teacher is an integral part of the learning experience. You often learn things from the professor, such as how to communicate your ideas coherently, less use of jargon, and so on. But with the multitude of professors working in the HSS department, how many can one know? Although a significant fraction of people found professors in the HSS department friendly and approachable, usually, what they know about a professor comes through word of mouth with no traceable source. Under such circumstances, a professor’s “good”ness is a subjective matter that is hard to convey. So what people mean by a “good” professor boils down to the comprehensibility of the course or the grading. Considering this, we can say that 22.4% makes a strong case in favour of the more objective criteria.",
      "The next question we asked was relatively straightforward –Which departments in HSS do people prefer?Economics topped the chart with almost 33% of people preferring it over other disciplines. It is helpful for people who plan to explore the finance sector professionally, and it has a reputation for being easier than other courses. Naturally, it becomes the top choice for many students. The ART and ENG disciplines follow with a preference percentage in the 13-15% bracket, followed by Psychology, Philosophy, and Sociology, set around 10%.",
      "Impact of HSS Courses",
      "Now that we have gained an understanding of the demographic, we can move to the second part of our study.How have the HSS courses been for the students who took them?We have a wide array of responses to this. Some people were irritated by the large amount of writing required for some HSS courses; a few others felt there was a lot of jargon in these courses. Such issues can be found in any stream and should not be a defining point in the argument against HSS courses. On the other side, the brighter side (or so to say), many respondents agreed that HSS courses are an essential refuge from usual engineering courses.",
      "In terms of difficulty, almost equal number of students stood on the ends of the spectrum, with the lion’s share staying in the middle. Regarding usefulness, 37.1% of respondents felt that the courses provided fruitful learning experiences. In comparison, 14% stood on the other side of the spectrum, saying they didn’t learn much from the courses. Even though the maximum percentage of students stood in the middle, the fact thatHSS courses positively influenced close to 40% peopleis commendable. Further,over 30% people also reported that they imbibed new ideals into their everyday life. This indicates how truly the HSS department stands to the aim of its establishment – evolving students into better leaders and decision-makers.",
      "The survey concludes with some interesting data that indicates that theimpact of HSS courses extends beyond the set expectations.More than 10% people opted for a minor or double major, or branch change to an HSS discipline. Add in the 5% that decided to pursue HSS for higher studies and the 12% that considered it but didn’t go through with it; we see that the number of people HSS courses positively impacted far outweighs the 23% who felt that the course didn’t live up to expectations.",
      "Attempt to Better",
      "It is fair to say that HSS courses are not unnecessary or pointless, as some might like to claim. There are ways through which the institute can increase engineering students’ overall interest in taking HSS courses. For instance, one way is to introduce the option of taking up minors in more disciplines under HSS for UG students. To increase the number of PG students taking HSS courses, a push towards interdisciplinary research shall prove beneficial. Addressing the issues regarding the lottery system will also help.",
      "The issues we will discuss in the next article within this series are the usefulness of a random allotment system and the necessity of HSS courses in an engineering curriculum. Please stay on the lookout for it to know what more the campus junta has to say!",

      "A team of competitive programmers from IIT Kanpur created history this year by winning the first position in Asia-West in the World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC) – a feat no other Indian team has ever achieved. ICPC, with over 50k students participating from 3000 universities around the world, is the world’s largest and oldest programming contest. And a team of three needs to get through an online local round and an on-site regional round to get to the World Finals.",
      "",
      "Team ACassins – comprising of Akhilesh Sharma (Y18, CSE), Mohan Raghu (Y17, EE+CSE) and Aryan Choudhary (Y17, EE) – talked to Team Vox on how they overcame injuries, visa issues and Dhaka’s notorious traffic to clinch the Asia-West title and how IITK did (not) help them in achieving this feat. Excerpts:",
      "Vox:If you trace back your journey in competitive coding, where will you place the starting point? Can you give us an outline of what the journey has been?At what point did you think you had a good shot at the ICPC?",
      "Akhilesh:I started competitive programming after seeing my brother do it. I began with Codechef before graduating to Codeforces. But it was not before covid struck that I got serious about it. My rating boosted significantly in the lockdown. When I saw Siddhartha Srivastava and Yash Chandnani’s team go to the World Finals, that became my inspiration. My team got a rank of 2698 in the regionals in my second year. In my third year, when my rating was around 2200, I felt I had a realistic shot at the ICPC.",
      "Aryan:I started after JEE, but before joining IITK. A senior advised me to learn C because a lot of freshmen struggled with it in the first year – so, I learnt C from a teacher in Jodhpur. During my initial months on the campus, I participated in the Freshers’ Programming Contest and wasn’t doing very well there, but that’s how I got to know about CP. Then I started participating in  Codechef Long Challenges regularly, even if that meant skipping classes 😉",
      "",
      "Vox: How did the three of you come together as a team? What do you think made you click?",
      "Akhilesh:I was in a different team initially and wanted to get into Aryan’s team. But he wouldn’t let us in (laughs). So, after a lot of team hopping I ended up with Abhinav and Mohan because both of them couldn’t get into Aryan’s team as well! Interestingly, I didn’t know either Abhinav or Mohan – we were brought together by a mutual friend. Later on, after qualification, Abhinav couldn’t participate in the World Finals and so, Aryan joined our team as his replacement.",
      "I guess what made us click was the tendency to not interfere when someone else was coding and respecting and trusting each other. Case in point – me and Mohan did not talk till the Amritapuri regionals! During practice sessions and prelims, we would divide the problems among ourselves and solve them independently. Towards the later stages of the contests we would come together and solve the problem according to our expertise.",
      "",
      "Vox: How would you describe your journey from the regionals to the World Finals?",
      "Akhilesh:The journey was nothing short of terrific, from getting 2698 rank in my second year to reaching the world finals. IITK had tremendous internal competition and was sure to send a team to the World Finals. In a sense, we were just competing with teams from IITK, and did not have to look up to other teams. I have no idea how we performed so well. We went to the regionals with no expectations, but ended up getting the second rank there. We were informed that the world finals would be held in Dhaka. Bad things happened before the ICPC world finals, Abhinav was denied a visa, I got into an accident and was on painkillers the whole time. Indigo was adamant on not letting Aryan board. Two days before the World Finals even Mohan fell sick.",
      "Aryan:In my third year, IITK had India’s rank 1, Yash Chandnani, and ICPC has a hard limit that there can be only one team from a college. My team was 7th in Amritapuri regionals among 300+ onsite teams. We would have qualified for World Finals in 2021 on a wildcard slot because a lot of teams backed out due to covid – if the other IITK team was not there. In my fourth year, we had 3 strong teams competing against each other for WFs. They were eventually ranked 2,4,4 in different regionals. Eventually, Akhilesh’s team qualified for World Finals due to their strong performance in Amritapuri regionals; other teams were close but did not qualify. Later on when Abhinav had issues, they asked me and I was like nekee aur pooch pooch.",
      "",
      "",
      "Vox: How did you prepare just before the contest?",
      "Akhilesh:Since I got into an accident, only Aryan and Raghu were able to practise, they practised some earlier editions of the world finals. We were just rusty but it wasn’t like we did not have knowledge.",
      "Aryan:I would say we were slow but we were able to solve problems. Even during the world finals, once we got our first accepted verdict near the half time, we breezed through 5 problems in the second half.",
      "",
      "Vox: How was your experience in Dhaka? How many other Indian teams were there and what expectations did you start the contest with?",
      "Akhilesh:The traffic in Dhaka was pathetic – worse than Bangalore. Our hotel was 10 kilometres from the contest venue. So we had to leave at 8 am to reach the venue at 10:30. We also had to leave the venue early to reach our hotels on time. The staff and volunteers were nice. Perhaps it helped that Aryan is a celebrity in the coding community ;).",
      "Aryan:The interaction with other Indian teams was nice. The IITB team was great – we used to play poker everyday and the winner would post Instagram stories. In fact, we were playing poker an hour before the contest. There was also some casual sledging. We would rant about the lack of vegetarian food in Bangladesh.",
      "Akhilesh:We had no expectations from the contest, because before the actual contest there is something called the ICPC challenge, which consists of optimization problems. We did very poorly in the challenge, and ranked second from last.",
      "Aryan:I wasn’t trusting Akhilesh with the code (both laugh) because he had not coded for a long time. In the World Finals, we solved three problems on pen and paper in the first two hours but were getting wrong answers repeatedly. We got our first Accept verdict at 2 hr 20 minutes.",
      "",
      "Vox:What are your personal future plans?Would you continue Competitive Programming (CP)?",
      "Akhilesh:I have already announced my retirement on Instagram so I’m not going to pursue CP anymore. ICPC hasn’t changed my personal life plans.",
      "Aryan:I had stopped hardcore CP last year, but you will still see me around for some time, probably because competitive programmers do not have a life outside xD.",
      "",
      "Vox: Your team had zero submissions for the first 2.5 hours of the 5-hour long contest. By the 4th hour, IITK stood at 76th position with only 3 correct submissions. But in the last hour, you guys rose 29 spots to secure the 49th position overall and first in Asia-West.",
      "How did this drastic increase happen in the last hour? What was going on in your mind?Aryan: To be honest, nothing! We just thought this problem looks doable, let’s do it. What pressure do you expect from someone who’s been at the last rank for the first half of the competition?",
      "Akhilesh:  As we had messed up the ICPC challenge, I didn’t take much pressure for the world finals and just wanted to do my best. So, when we had our third AC 3 hours, 40 minutes into the contest, me and Raghu were solving the first problem while Aryan was working on the last problem. We weren’t thinking about anything other than solving the problems to the best of our abilities.",
      "",
      "Vox: How do you think Indian CP culture is different from that practised internationally? What can we do to improve ours?",
      "Akhilesh:CP is pursued as a hobby abroad, whereas this is not the case in India. In Russia, China or the US, kids get exposed to CP in 6th-7th grade and they come to like it. Majority of the students in India are exposed to CP after coming to college and they do CP just to land into good internships or jobs. Most of the people are forced into CP and they too, start very late. Also, there are too many cases of Indians cheating in contests to improve their ratings. There are instances of people passing codes for 50 rupees on telegram. This has had a negative impact on the reputation of Indians coders. They are stereotyped to be cheaters and to some extent, this is true. I myself have seen tons of Indians buy or sell codes for intern or placement tests or just to improve their rating. This also kills the interest of the people doing CP as a passion.",
      "Aryan: Adding on to what Akhilesh pointed out, this isn’t the case at higher levels. People don’t stereotype Indians to be cheaters or undeserving. One big problem in India is that the kids who start early don’t usually grind for JEE. Rather, they participate in IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics, which is the school level equivalent of ICPC). Almost all kids1who perform well in IOI take admissions in foreign universities like NUS or University of Waterloo or even MIT. For instance, Malavika Raj Joshi won two silvers in the IOI but because she was homeschooled, she wasn’t even eligible for JEE. People who represent India in the world finals are people who started CP very late.",
      "In fact, Siddhartha (Y16 and twice ICPC World Finalist) was the UGARC student nominee – the UGARC recommended directly admitting IOI (and other PCM olympiad) students to IITK, but the proposal is taking forever in its implementation!",
      "",
      "Vox: Do you think IITK or the Programming Club at IITK helped you in your journey? If yes, how?",
      "Aryan: Honestly, I think IITK PClub’s responsibility starts and ends with organising the Linux install fest!If you look at IIT Roorkee, the professors there are motivated and their PClub takes up the responsibility of registering the teams. The only reason I could not participate in ICPC in my first year was that I could not find a professor to register for me. (To register for ICPC, a team needs a faculty coach).I would like to see the Programming Club take up the responsibility of registering the teams. Coordinators here did not want to sign up for that role when I went to them with this proposal about 4 years ago. In IITK, we have to approach the professors personally to get our team registered, which is not the case in other institutes like IITR or IIIT-H.",
      "Akhilesh: Moreover, if any other team would’ve won the West Asia title in their Institute, they would’ve got recognition for it back home – but in IITK, few people care. The teams from IITR, IIITH and DAIICT (basically every other Indian team) got a shoutout on their Institute’s official Linkedin page for just qualifying for the world finals. There’s no such culture at IITK. We were the first Indian team to become the Asia West Champion but we got no acknowledgement from the institute. Even the professor from IITR congratulated me thrice.",
      "Aryan:In fact, the PClub here at IITK is so defunct that this year only 5 teams registered in the ICPC online round and 10 registered in the year before. This is a massive decline from 2018, 2019, when almost 50ish teams participated in the online rounds and around 10 made it to the regionals. We used to have introductory ICPC sessions (for first timers), practice contests every weekend before regionals and a lecture series to support participating teams. This year the coordinators seem to have completely forgotten about the ICPC and there has been no publicity for the same. I’ll suggest the current and future PClub coordinators to look at the end-term reports of Y12-Y15 coordinators and you’ll find enough initiatives to work on.IITK FOSS grouphttps://students.iitk.ac.in/navya/about/is dead too. Although if one excludes last year, number of GSOCers have increased over the years. Frankly, it will be better to see PClub split into 4 different clubs (one for CP, ML, Cybersecurity and web dev each). These all are orthogonal but are currently under the umbrella of PClub. While IITR and other institutes have different clubs for each.",

      "In the past ten years, the stigma associated with mental health concerns has decreased significantly in our society. People are becoming more at ease discussing it, looking for assistance, finding solutions, and battling stigmatisation on a global scale throughout time. Naturally, the situation on our campus has improved as well. In terms of de-stigmatising mental health conditions, we have come a long way and achieved significant progress. Despite this, we have not yet found our happily ever after.",
      "Talking to some of the core team members from the counselling service, the Vox team realised that a layer of stigma still clouds the bright minds of our institute. We have a wide range of bottlenecks in the process, from the initial reluctance to seek treatment to combating societal judgement. This Mental Health Day, let us work together to take a step forward and strive to remove these impediments.",
      "What follows is a list of questions that we compiled on mental health and its surrounding stigmas, answered by a few professionals from the counselling service, core team members, and a few students who were willing to open up to us about it. Wishing you all a fun read, and a Happy Mental Health Day!",
      "The counselling service caters to over  1000 cases per year. Academic stress, mood disorders, emotional problems, traumas, depression, anxiety, poor coping skills, addiction issues and sleep disturbances are a few of the causes. More than often, it’s an amalgamation of several issues. The same causes can range in intensity depending on one’s emotional vulnerabilities. In other words, while exam stress can be easily managed for some students, it may also act as a trigger for others. A CS counsellor remarked, “Students sometimes just want to chat about what’s going on in their lives and see if they have a problem. At times, when students are unable to cope with immediate stressors like exams or breakups, they ask for single-session-therapies (SSTs), in which they come for one session to talk about their concerns.”",
      "There were also a few instances where students could not adapt to the change in environment when they come to campus.  A lot of students approached CS in recent times due to the inability to adapt to the offline shift of academics.",
      "Living alone in a different environment, that too after being cooped up for over 2-3 years was tougher than I expected​",
      "Another counsellor told us – “Most of the students here were a few of the smartest students in their schools. Many new students struggle with feeling uneasy about not being the sharpest person in the class when they first arrive.”",
      "There is a difference between a counsellor, a therapist and a psychiatrist.A therapist is a licensed psychologist who uses different therapies and Behaviour modification techniques to treat mental health symptoms.A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can diagnose and prescribe drugs to treat mental health disorders.Counsellors in CS are professional and licensed therapists, they offer different kinds of help depending on the need/trauma faced by the student in their lives.",
      "“Not every case that contacts CS is referred to external psychiatrists. Even then, not every patient that is referred outside requires medication.”",
      "I just had to hit rock bottom to realise that I needed help.​",
      "Most students are reluctant to ask for help. Some might feel that they can solve the problems independently, and some might be embarrassed to seek help. A few students hesitate because they fear being judged by society, their parents or their friends. We saw a magnified version of this when it came to medication.",
      "“We strongly promote medical treatment whenever it is necessary. But we cannot enforce it upon someone.” said the counselling service. “Weprovide psychological education to the students regarding their mental health conditions and let themmake the final call. Not their parents, not their peers, not us, just them.”",
      "“ I knew that something was wrong for a very long time,” a student told Vox, “but generally in society, you have this notion that you can work on this on your own. If you get up at 6 AM and run, your life will get better. “",
      "It was seen that in most cases, initially there was a lot of hesitation to take meds.",
      "However, after a few counselling sessions, students seemed to get more comfortable with medication. “The problem with taking drugs is that students are afraid of getting addicted to them or being dependent on them. They feel that it is a lifelong treatment or that if they stop taking their medicines, they will repeat the same cycle of problems.” the CS told us.",
      "When it comes to drugs, the professionals take into account your body requirements, diet, exercise, genetic vulnerability and medical history before they recommend the required medicines. They also check for family history. The course usually starts with a small dosage, to see if it’s working and if there are any side effects, and then the dosage is slowly increased.",
      "It takes a couple of weeks for the medicine to understand your body and work accordingly.",
      "A student remarked – “I feel that it’s very scary to take medication because it feels like you’re meddling with your brain. In the beginning, I felt a little bit of a high whenever I took the meds because my mind knew something was wrong but my brain felt happy. It took me a couple of weeks for it to work.”",
      "“One important thing to note,” a counsellor said,  “is that students should try not to abruptly stop the medication or change its course without an actual medical consultation. The course is tailored in such a way that the dosage is slowly tapered off and not stopped abruptly.”",
      "All medication does not induce sleep. In the initial days, some students might feel a little drowsy. “A lot of body factors are taken into account before prescribing any drugs. So we would suggest not to worry too much about the side effects.” said the CS.",
      "The duration for which a patient has to take medicines varies depending on their case. “For most cases where a student was well adjusted before coming to IIT and has no major history of psychiatric illness in the family, the medications are not lifelong at all. For such students combination of medication and psychotherapy works best.”The sooner the problem is detected, the better the prognosis. The dosage and its effects are influenced by a person’s genes, coping mechanisms, any ongoing drugs, and the frequency of the dosage.",
      "“Medication requires patience. For someone, it can take 2 weeks to see the outcome. Someone could need twice the dosage and still not see the results after a month.Follow up are made at the discretion of the psychiatrist.”",
      "The drugs that are usually given are anti-anxiety meds, anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. Interestingly, the meds don’t differ much, but different amounts of the same drugs can help with different mental health conditions. Sometimes different combinations of drugs are prescribed as per the variation of cases.",
      "Medication should only be stopped when prescribed by psychiatrists. “At times, people stop taking their meds when they start feeling good, as they don’t feel the need for the meds anymore. They also give up if they see no change after a couple of days, and then they stop taking medicines. This is strongly unadvised.”",
      "“Parents are not always informed in case of medication, only in serious or extreme cases.” the CS told us.  “We assure full confidentiality at all times, however, if a student has to be admitted to an external hospital, or if the case is severe, then the patient’s family is informed.”",
      "A student told us – “Throughout this whole process, you face a lot of bottlenecks. When you’re having your good days it’s hard to see that you need help. When your sessions don’t go good, you feel like quitting. At times you feel that you can solve the problems on your own, or at times you’re just too preoccupied to even think about such things. But you have to take that leap of faith. Asking for help, seeking therapy/counselling, and taking medication if necessary is the only way to go about it. Anything else will just be temporary.”",
      "“It has to come from within. No one can push you to take these steps.” another student said.",
      "The Counselling service stated that they had a few ideas – “We, as an institute, have upcoming plans for group therapies, talks with psychiatrists, support groups, etc. However, we feel that the student community needs to be more proactive to destigmatise these issues.” a counsellor told us. “Street dramas, hall-level mental health talks and sessions, student blogs about success stories, etc can help us start a conversation and abolish the stigma against medication.”",
      "We should make it clear that getting help isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a sign of strength.",

      "Early on, at the start of the millennia, Mr Satish Kaura, an alumnus of our institute, was running a business that manufactured most of the cathode ray tubes for displays in the country. However, he had the foresight to realise that the industry would need to be nimble and change and evolve in the coming years. The inception of the Flexible Electronics ecosystem at IIT Kanpur was set in motion with the Samtel Centre for Display Technologies coming up under the guidance and leadership of Prof. K. R. Sarma, Prof. R. Sharan and a team of enthusiastic faculty members from multiple departments from the institute.",
      "While this facilitated and enhanced academia-industry collaboration, there were still challenges faced to translate the research ideas into manufacturing and making the ideations commercially viable. The National Centre for Flexible Electronics (Flex-E Centre), built as a centre of excellence, came about to address this need. The Flex-E Centre is home to the intersection of industrial ideation, manufacturing and entrepreneurial ventures engaging with corporate pioneers and academicians, along with the support of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) of the Government of India and the Institute administration. With more than 20 member industries and NDAs with over 125 organisations, the Flex-E Centre stands tall in the academic area as a place of innovation and science. To cover what goes on at this flagship centre on our campus, correspondents from Vox Populi reached out to Prof. Sundar Kumar Iyer, the current coordinator of the centre and visited the facility to get a glimpse of the day-to-day happenings there.",
      "The Flex-E Centre building is a modern state-of-the-art facility that is home to more than 10 ongoing projects spanning various topics. The core group leading this centre consists of faculty members as mentors, a chief operating officer (COO) and subject expert team leaders. They are ably supported in carrying out the activities by several research, maintenance and office staff.  Many of the researchers involved with the centre have international and international experience.  Currently, the activities in the facility are funded by MeitY, the strategic sector (eg. Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO and the Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO) and industrial partners. The annual operational costs for the centre add up to an amount of 8 – 10 crores.",
      "We then visited the support labs, starting with theWet lab, which is where inks are developed for printing electronics on various flexible substrates, such as plastics, paper, cloth and metal foils. The in-house develops inks, often custom built on request of partner industries and ongoing projects. These inks along with some commercially available ink provide the basic building block of flexible and printed electronic products.",
      "At the other end of the prototype and product development is theSystems Lab.  Here the innovative printed components developed are giving a useful practical product form, often in conjunction with traditional electronics and already available articles.  In this lab, we got to see some novel applications developed by the centre which address some of the common-place problems faced by the average person in society. The lab has many tools to facilitate its work, including circuit magnifiers, equipment to integrate chips on printed circuit boards, a 3D printer, circuit testing equipment and the like.",
      "The various flexible electronic components developed are often tested and refined in some of the other labs which we viewed from the outside – theElectrical Lab,Optics Lab,Materials LabandSensors Lab.",
      "We got a glimpse of some of the products developed at the centre by the different groups.  The problems that the products address are practical and often typically Indian in their context.",
      "One such product, which is built upon investigative research carried out earlier at IIT Kanpur, is aboutverifying milk quality(Prof. Siddhartha Panda, Dr  Devendra Mourya and team). Milk in India is often procured by cooperatives from multiple households.  Contamination from any one source will contaminate the whole collection. This project aims to detect many of the common contaminants quickly, effectively and at a low cost so that contaminated milk may be identified just before it is received.",
      "We got to view some innovative applications in healthcare developed at the centre. Prof. Mazhari, Mr Biswanath Panda and the team have developed a few versions oftemperature monitoring devicesthat were deployed during the pandemic within our institute.  Another innovation by this team is detecting the level of liquid in intravenous (IV) fluid bottles used in medical facilities.  This innovation can sensitise the nurse electronically or by an alarm, once the level liquid comes close to finishing.  The innovative labels used for this prototype were built with in-house ink and printed in the roll-to-roll machine.  This product when deployed will greatly aid in giving better treatment to patients and ease the stress on caregivers.",
      "Warm hugis a product developed by multiple teams at the centre. For this product, heaters are printed with in-house developed carbon inks and then integrated into jackets.  The heaters are self-limiting at the maximum temperature they can reach and hence are safe for regular use. These jackets are primarily being developed to assist soldiers placed at higher altitudes to stay warm while using minimal electrical power – equivalent to the order of which we store in our phone batteries – to heat up the jacket. The initial prototypes were tried out by SIS guards at our campus in the Kanpur winters. The ITBP has been in talks with Flex-E Centre to test and assess deployment in higher altitudes.",
      "Another area of innovation isflexible displays and lightingwith organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  Prof. Monica Katiyar, Dr Muralidharan Balasubramanian and the team are exploring a variety of applications, including in the automobile sections.  Similarly, Prof. Deepak Gupta, Dr Ashutosh Tripathi and the team are involved in many innovative projects with DRDO and ISRO  using thin film transistor (TFT) technology and other devices for deployment in submarines and antennas respectively. Prof. Anshu Gaur is looking into using amorphous metal-oxide and metal-oxynitride semiconductors to build flexible electronic devices.  Prof. Iyer’s team is developingflexible solar modules on paper substrates.",
      "Flex-E Centre has spawned a couple of start-up ventures. One such start-up isCheckofrom Prof. Deepak Gupta’s team, which prints PUFs (Physically Unclonable Features). The unique ID of the PUF can be verified for authenticity by using a pre-downloaded app on a smartphone.  The product is currently used by Madhya Pradesh Beej Nigam and the Delhi Excise Department, besides many private companies that want to ensure their brand protection.",
      "The second start-up is mentored by the ink team led by Prof.  Y.N. Mohapatra and Dr Ashish Gupta calledLikhotronics. The pens this start-up has developed have different conductive inks which are supplied with a do-it-yourself (DIY) kit.  By drawing lines with these pens on paper, one can build circuits which could be used to help children learn concepts in electronics.  This is expected to have an impact on education – teaching and examining electrical circuit concepts – in the coming years.",
      "The strength of the centre, we were told, is its ability to reach out to the industry and work with them in developing many relevant solutions with it. This process is ably supported by the COO Dr Sudheer Kumar along with the individual faculty members and other team members involved.",
      "The Flex-E Centre is a multidisciplinary centre institute, where research results from various disciplines – electronics, materials, chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, bio-engineering, etc. are harnessed for addressing the needs of society. Such a dynamic centre of excellence, with cutting-edge innovation and technological advancements coming out of it, is a matter of immense pride not just for our Institute but for our nation as well. Keep an eye out for novel ideas and technologies from this engineering and science centre!",
      "We genuinely thank Prof. Sundar Kumar Iyer for his great zeal and support in helping us write this article.",

      "Over four weeks after being fired and given the reassurance of re-employment in other departments, 18 water-supply workers of the Institute remain unemployed.They are now staging an indefinite dharna in front of the IWD (Institute Works Department) until their demand to be re-employed with minimum wages is met.",
      "",
      "What happened?",
      "",
      "As Vox had reported on 1 August 2022,  18 workers from the water supply and sewage department of the Institute were fired without prior notice, owing to a change in the contractor. The pumps that 49 workers operated are now operated by just 31. Following this event, over one hundred workers had gathered outside the IWD on 31 July, demanding their re-employment. The Senior Engineer at IWD had then, informed them that the Deputy Director had assured employment for all of them in some other department of the Institute. Four weeks have passed since, and the workers have approached the office multiple times-but there appears to be no sign of relief. Many have taken loans to sustain themselves through these four weeks, and others have had to empty their savings.",
      "",
      "What are their demands?",
      "",
      "The workers have demanded written answers from authorities on questions like:",
      "",
      "On what grounds were they fired?",
      "On what basis were the retained workers selected?",
      "",
      "They further mention the case of sump well no. 7 located near the airstrip. One of the fired workers (name retracted) had been operating the sump well for the past 22 years. Post his firing, no new worker is ready to operate this sump well at night, owing to the constant danger of snakes and other wild animals. The workers have raised concerns about the consequences of improper functioning of that sump well on the sewer line.",
      "",
      "They also allege favouritism and nepotism in the selection process of the retained workers. Many feel better connections with contractors helped some workers retain their jobs.",
      "",
      "Later at night the workers were not allowed to stage their dharna and were subsequently removed by SIS guards.",
      "",
      "Institute’s view",
      "",
      "Four weeks after the verbal assurance of re-employment, these promises from the IWD Senior Engineer seem empty. When we visited the Minimum Wages Office, we were told that the workers will soon be ‘adjusted’ in other departments as new buildings are coming up on the campus. Moreover, they told us that the Institute has directed them not to hire any new workers in any department, instead adjusting the current workers first.",
      "",
      "Worker’s concerns",
      "",
      "Workers across departments are concerned that they may as well be fired soon, thanks to a wave of new tenders and increased mechanization of processes. In particular, waste disposal workers expressed concerns about their new tender which reduces the strength of workers to 10, and are expecting a similar incident in their department.",

      "",
      "Metacognition, in simple words, is thinking about your thoughts. Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? Prof. Shikha Dixit (Professor in Psychology at IIT Kanpur) and Prof. Sabnam Basu (Assistant Professor in management at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad) worked on a paper to find therole of metacognition in rational decision making. While releasing this paper, Prof. Sabnam was a final year PhD student working under the supervision of Prof. Shikha Dixit. To understand more about their work and the use of metacognition in our daily life, Vox talked to Prof. Sabnam Basu. Read on to find more about her research:",
      "",
      "Higher-order cognition! In layman’s terms, we call it thinking about thinking; We all make multiple daily decisions, and the process of decision-making involves information processing. However, everyone has a different and individual style of making decisions. Some people are prone to making intuitive decisions, so they might rely more on their feelings when making a decision. Some people might do a lot of research and try to gather a lot of information about the issue at hand, and thus it can be said that they follow a rational style of decision-making. Some people might depend on others, like their friends or parents, to decide; in contrast, some might make an impulsive decision. So what role would metacognition play?",
      "How we control your thought process, monitor it and regulate would help us decide which kind of decision-making style you are taking up. Metacognition again has two components: the regulation component and the knowledge component. The knowledge component is the information one has about their cognitive abilities. The regulation component is about how we monitor our cognitive skills.",
      "",
      "There are two systems of the brain, System I and System II. System I is the fast and intuitive process, while System II is the slow and deliberate one. Usually, when we encounter day-to-day decisions or activities, system I of the brain takes precedence as it requires lesser cognitive effort. Thus multiple decisions every day are made without doing much deliberation. However, whenever we encounter a decision that is of great importance or has a higher difficulty level, it has been found that System II takes over. Thus initial decisions taken via gut feeling might be revisited by going in depth. Similarly, when talking in terms of decision-making style, it has been observed that people do not always have one decision-making style. They could have a primary style and a secondary style.",
      "",
      "My other paper on depression talks about when the number of choices increases, the person might find themselves revisiting the decision after making it. In earlier times, for example, our parents would have two or three college choices. So even if they took a ‘wrong decision’, they would not blame themselves; they’d blame the situation. But nowadays, we would blame ourselves if we take an ‘incorrect decision’ as we had a whole lot of choices available and still made an incorrect decision. So, as the paper suggests, the abundance of choices in modern times might be a contributing factor to the prevalence of depression.",
      "",
      "Yes! There was another category of decision-makers I had talked about in the paper, called maximisers. Maximisers try to optimise their decision-making by looking at all available options. For example, if a maximiser looks for a gift for their friend, they would look at all the possible options and then decide, as opposed to someone who would just go and buy the first gift they like and not look at it every opportunity. Studies suggest that these people are more prone to depression and also that their metacognition skills are deficient. Thus metacognition might act as a buffer.",
      "",
      "There are two things here. The first is the decision’s outcome. On a scale called the Decision Outcome Inventory (DOI), it questions your ‘life’s outcomes’ such as receiving a parking ticket or getting into a mild accident. The point is to ask if people have faced these outcomes from bad decisions. Based on this, we decide if the person’s decision-making style is good or bad.",
      "The second thing we look at is biases. If these increase in one’s decision-making, that is a wrong decision. An example of a decision-making bias is the availability bias. Some people are still hesitant to go on aeroplanes because they believe them to be unsafe, but if one were to look at the data, air travel is the safest mode of transportation. But this fear still prevails because when an aeroplane accident occurs, it escalates to such a degree that it becomes salient in your mind. At the same time, this doesn’t happen with regular road accidents—availability of information matters.",
      "",
      "",
      "In psychology, we perform the preliminary research and based on that, we prepare a questionnaire. Furthermore, the questionnaire asks multiple questions to assess a single parameter. This way, if one question doesn’t give a good result, another one would. Sometimes questions are also repetitive. For example, one question might be, “Do you rely on your feelings?” and another one would be, “Do you rely on your emotions?” This way, we can check how truthful the person is and whether they are following some random pattern for answering the survey and not actually answering. There are even some questions to check social desirability.",
      "",
      "",
      "The importance of cognition can be felt everywhere today. Even IIT Kanpur has recently established a cognitive science department. This highlights the importance of cognition in today’s time. Moreover, previously metacognition was mainly studied in the educational psychology domain with implications for student learners. However, it has become necessary to link metacognition and decision-making over the years. Now the importance of metacognition is not only limited to educational psychology but has even spread to organizational behaviour, as the more aware you are of your mental capacity, the fewer biases you’ll face in decision-making.",
      "",
      "",
      "The primary advice for all would be to follow your interest. You have to work with that specific subject for a lot of time. Thus you must have a keen interest in the same. In research, I’d say that patience is the crucial element for the successful completion of your work. There would be instances where the variable or your statistic data might not seem significant. But don’t you think insignificant results also speak a lot? They are an essential part of your research. So never get discouraged by insignificant results. There might be times when you would want to give up. But, you have to be patient and think of their entire research journey as learning. Be focused and take small steps towards your ultimate goal. This would help you with your mental health as well as the research.",

    "content": [
      "A team of engineers and research scholars led by Prof. Rohit Budhiraja from the Electrical Engineering department of the Institute has contributed to the design of the first indigenous 5G network. The complete hardware and software of this 5G network was built from scratch, and that too completely inhouse.  India’s first 5G call was recently made using this network by the telecom minister. Vox team talked to Prof. Budhiraja to break down the development and what it means for the country:",
      "The 5G mobile network consists of our phone, the base station (BS), and the core network. A BS further consists of three different sub-systems:  baseband unit (BBU), remote radio head (RRH) and the antennas. The BBU is the heart of the 5G network which processes the data which needs to be transmitted by the BS to the user or receive from it.  To indigenously build the 5G technology in the country, various institutes worked on different parts of the 5G network. While IIT Bombay developed the core network, IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras took up the responsibility for development of the entire BS hardware and software.",
      "This is the first nationally-endorsed project globally for the 5G initiative. While a few private corporations have been significant players in the market, India as a nation emerges as the first country to indigenously build a 5G network.",
      "All our systems are dependent on telecom networks today. If this network falls into the wrong hands or is controlled by a monopolized market, then critical systems of the entire country lie susceptible. This is one of the reasons why we should have indigenous technology. Such indigenous system design also helps in training the young engineers who want to solve challenging problems. It also helps in reducing the telecom import bill, which is currently the second highest after that of oil. Although a few Indian companies have developed system components, they are isolated components and do not constitute the entire network.",
      "5G and previous telecom generations primarily differ in three broad aspects over a 4G network",
      "The 5G system design complexity, when compared with 4G, due to the aforementioned aspects, has also increased exponentially.",
      "We had to tackle numerous problems in our journey, but I’ll particularly share one incident we had while testing the BBU, which consists of a motherboard, and our custom hardware card. Both of them communicate via a PCI connection that acts as an interface to send data. The correct way is to connect the custom hardware card’s transmitter with the motherboard’s receiver. However, due to a small overlook, our team connected the card’s transmitter to the motherboard’s transmitter.",
      "",
      "Although it looks like a naive error, it was a significant blunder. The motherboard didn’t detect the card, and our team went clueless. We had to spend a lot of time understanding which component was going wrong. Without testing the transmitter, we couldn’t test the card. We realized our mistake after almost three months of rigorous testing.",
      "",
      "Interestingly, a cross helped us verify if the card and the transmitter are working. However, in the entire globe, there was just one vendor for cross-cable. Thankfully we ordered the device before the lockdown and as soon as the cable landed in IIT Kanpur, we could confirm that the card was working properly. Hence, with just a few design changes, we were ready to roll. This helped in reducing the overall system design cost.",
      "",
      "Building a subsystem is challenging, and bringing all of it together is even more complicated. The more complex the problem is, the more satisfaction it gives to make it work. The urge to solve complex problems drove my students to leave their high-paying  corporate jobs, come back and work on these projects.",
      "Every decade, there is a generation shift in the telecom industry – 3G in 2000, 4G in 2010, and 5G in 2022. So by 2030, we can expect 6G to get materialized.The standards of different generations are designed by standard making bodies. My lab first performs theoretical research on 6G technologies. We do this  first by analyzing these technologies using advanced mathematical tools like machine learning, convex optimization, information theory, and linear algebra. We then push these ideas to standards. My team regularly attends standard meetings, which were being held online, and have recently become offline. They will soon start traveling abroad to attend these meetings, and that too every month and a half.",
      "There are a lot of challenging theoretical and practical research problems in the 5G+/6G wireless domain which are waiting to get cracked. We need motivated and hardworking students to work on them. My advice is once you start working on these problems, you need to be patient while solving them. You should not get deterred by the impediments you might face. It is about being patient and tackling them. Students should be willing to make mistakes, learn from them, not repeat the old mistakes, and again willing to make fresh ones. We have had a lot of B.Tech students with such an attitude. They have worked with complete determination with us in their 4th year, and have even got their papers published in one year. All such students are now either doing cutting-edge research in their PhD or working in top-notch wireless research companies.",
      "During my masters, the inclination toward research was relatively low. Wireless companies could not find students who had experience working in wireless networks, as students did not opt for research. The change in attitude came in the last 20 years, when the government focused on promoting IITs as research institutes. Now, there is a transition in IITs from undergraduate teaching institutes to research institutes.",
      "",
      "This change is visible in also the teachings imparted as we offer state-of-the-art courses which are relevant for both theoretical and standards-based research. The undergraduate and postgraduate students can now equip themselves with the relevant skill-set  by first doing relevant courses, and then performing the cutting-edge research, which will help them in building a promising career.",

      "Where does our campus get water from? Is the drinking water we get drinkable? What are the globally accepted standards of potable water? How should it taste?",
      "To seek answers to these questions, our team took readings from water samples around the campus, questioned the respective authorities, and looked into the flipside of the obvious RO solution. Here’s what we found out:",
      "Groundwater is the primary source of water on campus! The campus is equipped with ten bore wells, each of which is about 400 feet deep. Water pumped from these borewells is directly supplied to the halls by the IWD (Institute Works Department). The job of purification and installation of coolers falls under the purview of the respective Hall Executive Committee (HEC).",
      "",
      "The other potential source of water is the Kanpur Municipal Corporation, however, the municipal corporation has not been able to set up a stable water supply inside the campus yet, due to transportation issues. Another significant source of water for the campus is rainwater. A total of 20 buildings on campus are equipped with rainwater harvesting pits.",
      "",
      "To measure the standards of water supplied on the campus, our team went around the campus with a TDS meter and took readings from various water sources. But first, let us understand what TDS is.",
      "TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids – it is a measure of the concentration of the dissolved solids in mg/L (i.e. parts per million). These solids, ranging from minerals and metals to organic material and salts, account for the water’s quality, suitability for consumption, and perceived taste. Hence, we use TDS as a metric to determine if the water is fit for drinking, cooking, and other relevant purposes. However, our approach comes with two caveats.",
      "",
      "Firstly, TDS is only one of the many metrics used to judge the suitability of water. We can have a water sample with near optimum TDS levels, yet being unfit for drinking. This is because TDS is only a measure of the concentration of the dissolved salts, and does not tell us anything about which salts are actually dissolved.",
      "",
      "Secondly, taste is a subjective parameter and thereby, is somewhat unrelated to the TDS levels. However, it has been found that water with higher TDS levels seems to have a heavier “metallic” taste. On the contrary, lower TDS levels are linked with virtually no taste.",
      "Three benchmarks are majorly used to analyze water quality – the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards), WHO (World Health Organization), and Bisleri. The limits of acceptance vary only slightly between these three standards. These are the Bisleri standards:",
      "Our team took TDS readings from multiple water sources – both in residential halls and in public places like OAT and Academic Area. Multiple readings were taken from each source usingthisTDS meter, and the average of these readings has been used in the graphs below. Here are our findings:",
      "As we can see from the data, the water quality in most halls of residences remains unacceptable. The water sources in the Academic Area perform better than the halls. This is also in line withtheTDS level of water in Kanpur city, which is above 500.",
      "As per our study, RO seems to have improved the TDS readings of sources significantly.",
      "Recently, Hall 6 installed a second 500-centralized RO (costing about 4.2 lakh, including installation charges and regular servicing of the machine), in addition to one RO already purchased in January 2021. This brought sharp improvement in TDS readings in the hall, as compared to the readings we took before RO installation.",
      "Similarly, Hall 5, which is equipped with two centralized RO and another RO near the mess, displayed much lower TDS readings. This is in contrast with Hall 3, which has no centralized RO.",
      "However, in 2019,the Supreme Court upheld the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ban on RO water purifiers in areas with TDS levels less than 500. The following reasons were provided for the RO ban:",
      "",
      "Demineralization",
      "RO often deprives drinking water of essential salts that are naturally present in natural water and provide us with essential minerals. In our study, this was most prominently seen in the water of computer center RO, which gave an astonishing reading of just 6ppm.",
      "Water wastage",
      "For every one liter of potable water, RO water filters push out three to four liters of water, as per broad estimates. According to the Water Quality India Association, RO achieves 20-30 percent purified water and 70-80 percent is drained which is not disposed of properly. Some manufacturers, however, claim that their brands result in minimal reject water and up to 60 percent purified water.",
      "",
      "Hence, installing ROs to improve water quality needs to be looked at with a more nuanced lens. Improvement in water purity at the cost of questionable water quality and large water wastage needs to be studied in more detail.",
      "In response to the data obtained, our team talked to a few officials in the IWD office.We came to know that the IWD receives regular, often strongly worded complaints from students regarding the installation of RO purifiers in halls, and of how an RO purifier is akin to a “basic necessity”. This indeed seems to be the mainstream perception of ROs.",
      "The dysfunctionality of the Hall office, central stores, and DOSA offices during the covid pandemic stalled the completion of formalities for the purchase of ROs, leading to an extended period of dependence on mineral water and water from the mess, and few buildings in the academic area.",
      "In the last few years, the water quality has improved significantly as more and more residential blocks are getting RO purifiers. But is the RO solution sustainable? And if not, what lies ahead?",

      "“Youth are natural seekers of truth. Time to empower them with the needed clarity, commitment, and courage to find their truth” ~ Sadhguru",
      "Sadhguru, a bestselling author and mystic, recently embarked on a journey to meet citizens, leaders, and experts as a lone motorcyclist covering 30,000 km across 27 nations from the United Kingdom to India in 100 days for the “Save Soil” campaign.",
      "As a part of his journey, he visited the IIT Kanpur on June 8, 2022, marking the 80th day of the “Save Soil” campaign. Volunteers from the Isha foundation were present on campus days before the event. This event, titled the “Youth and Truth” campaign, was hosted by Students’ Gymkhana in association with Antaragni, IIT Kanpur.",
      "The event commenced with the songs of the “Save Soil” campaign by the Isha Foundation. To add more melody to the event, Chaand Baaliyan fame, Aditya Sirsa, mesmerized the audience with the Sounds of Isha.",
      "Isha Foundation presented multiple video clips to increase awareness about the “Save Soil” campaign explaining the importance and need of the movement. Following it, the Isha Samskriti group gave a surreal Bharatnatyam and Kalaripayattu performance.",
      "Theperformances were followed by a video highlighting the first 80 days of the campaign. Beginning in Europe, the campaign went through the Middle East, later coming to India, to be concluded in Coimbatore. During this journey, the “Save Soil” initiative was presented on April 5 at the United Nations in Geneva. It gathered support from WHO, the UN SDG lab (UN Sustainable Development Goals), and the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).",
      "Just after the video presentation, Sadhguru made a stage appearance joining the panel of students. The panel asked questions on diverse themes and evoked some unique and a few questionable insights from Sadhguru.",
      "",
      "Owing to the increasing relevance and awareness of mental health, Sadhguru was asked to give his views on why it is borderline offensive to suggest therapy to someone struggling with mental health issues. In response, he explained how the discourse around mental health is borrowed from the West and its understanding of psychology. He also mentioned the psychology of seeking attention and how human intelligence, as vital as it is, begins to work against us during mental illness.",
      "",
      "The discourse then explained why students at IIT (especially the freshers) feel like a misfit. Sadhguru talked about the huge competition to get into IIT and how the facilities provided here are better than in other places. He then established the importance of interest in the field one pursues rather than the social stature of being at IIT.",
      "",
      "In answer to his views on marijuana legalisation, Sadhguru dwelled upon the wastage of valuable time in intoxication. He talked about his beliefs that life’s purpose is to grow and develop, not fleeting away from reality. He also quoted a Telugu saying (to massive applause from the Telugu speaking audience).",
      "",
      "In response to a question asked from the perspective of an introverted student struggling to socialise, Sadhguru compares one’s nature to a mask one puts on oneself. He responded, “It should be malleable and not a rigid concrete wall. Suppose an introvert disposes of the perception that they are an introvert and goes on in life believing that they are comfortable in socialising and networking; gradually, that becomes a part of their personality.”",
      "",
      "He later addressed a question on the lack of emphasis on the aspect of compassion in movements of veganism and vegetarianism and over-emphasis solely on its health benefits. He stated how the quantity of meat consumed in the western lifestyle is way more than the amount typically consumed in Indian households. Thus it is logical in India for people to opt for vegetarianism on compassionate grounds rather than being motivated by its health benefits. Despite health-driven veganism movements failing to put forth a sympathetic stance in their campaigns, they ultimately succeed in attaining their purpose. Hence he believes lack of emphasis on compassionate grounds is not a big issue",
      "The panellists then opened the stage for the audience. A professor asked Sadhguru about the waning significance of the “guru-shishya parampara” in modern times. Sadhguru talked about the undue importance of information transfer in contemporary education and the increasing influence of technology in providing information, replacing human teachers.",
      "When asked by a first-year student about losing interest in spiritualism, Sadhguru mentioned how nature would prevent the discontinuation of such spiritual practices if it benefits humankind. This way, he tried motivating the student not to get ahead of himself in pursuing spiritual goals.",
      "After the panel and audience questions were over, a zealous devotee burst with emotions and conveyed her devotion to Sadhguru. With tears of happiness, she gifted Sadhguru a shawl which he accepted respectfully.",
      "",
      "Post the event, in interaction with the IITK Motor-Sports team, Sadhguru recalled how his motorbike often served as much more than just a vehicle.",
      "Later, the team showed their latest ATV “BAJA’20” mounter with “Save Soil” flags to Sadhguru. In their conversation with Sadhguru, the team explained that ATV possesses a lawn mower engine. Also, being lightweight, it doesn’t affect the soil culture as it moves on an uneven surface, thus in line with the save soil campaign. The team members and Sadhguru talked passionately about engines and how vehicles can be engineered to suit various needs. Sadhguru provided insights to the team for improving the efficiency of the vehicle and making it more environmentally friendly. The discussion ended on a high note, with Sadhguru giving the team a tour of his bike.",
      "From there on, Sadhguru took off on his bike to the next stop at Jhansi.",

The people who’ve been on the campus since before the pandemic can surely tell that it does seem a bit different.",

Its name was recently revealed when it was inaugurated on 20th April by Dr. Radhakrishnan (Chairperson, BoG, IITK). The 109 crore cost of the building justifies its size – a massive carpet area of 35,000 square meters, which is roughly the same as 5 football fields! It is now the largest academic building on campus by far – even the purpose of a lot of the building rooms hasn’t been decided yet!",
      "The complex is 5 storeys, and would have various labs for UGs and PGs, lecture halls, and would also function as the department building for the Deptt of Design and the Deptt of Sustainable Energy Engineering.",
      "In between the NCL and the Flight Lab, the construction of the Science & Technology Building is in progress. (with no relation to the SnT Council :P)",
      "The construction started in October 2020; and was expected to end this winter. However, COVID and lockdowns brought many halts to the work, and this 5-story building is now expected to be ready with all amenities by Diwali 2022. The project costs a little over 58 crores which includes BMS, water supply, sanitary installation, lifts, fire alarms, and PA systems.",
      "Adjacent to the site of the S&T Building, another construction is going on. Yes, you guessed it right, another research building! This one, called the Research Lab Complex, has been under work since April 2021 and is aiming for completion by the start of 2023. The project cost is estimated to be under 75 crores, including amenities like plumbing, sewage system, electrical works, fire alarms, lift, PA system, and a Building Management System (BMS) for centralized management of the infrastructure.",
      "3 floors have been constructed till March 2022. If the current pace of construction isn’t disrupted, we’ll surely have many more research labs by the turn of the year.",
      "As we go ahead from the TechnoPark Building towards the Flight Lab, we come across a towering 7-floor construction nearing completion. This building is the Earth Science Labs Building. It has been under construction for the last 3 years, but due to COVID setbacks, the work hasn’t been completed yet. The work was fully halted from March to June 2020 due to COVID. The fully furnished building is expected to be handed over to the institute in the next 2-3 months. The project cost is estimated to be nearly 19.7 Crore rupees.",
      "Across the road from the IME building, we have the Aerospace Department building that is nearing its completion, and by the time of this article’s publishing, might be handed over to the institute in under 2 months. It is a 7-floored building, including ground, along with a basement. As usual, this building was to be completed by end of 2020 but hasn’t been fully furnished even now. We can only assume that the delay in the construction was not only due to the pandemic, but also some other factors.",
      "Now, being handed over, the building is nearly done up with plumbing, sewage, electrical works, fire fighting systems, CCTV systems, etc., and its cost sums up to just below 58 crores.",
      "Well, you can’t call every new lab building “New Core Labs”, right? Hence this one is called Core Labs Extension. Adjacent to the Materials Sciences Labs, ACES building, and the DoAA Canteen, the construction on this site was projected to end in April 2020 itself, but it’s still not inaugurated. Though out of the listed buildings not inaugurated yet, this would probably be the first.",
      "As is evident, the building would provide more labs, mostly for the core departments such as MSE, CHE, CHM, etc. The construction is of 4 floors, including ground, and its estimated cost is about 10 crore rupees.",
      "That large building you see being built from the porch of CCD, or the skywalk near the Library? That’s the Faculty BuildingAnnexe. Google would help you with what ‘Annexe’ means. (It helped us too :P)",
      "The project manager tells us that this building would provide for the new offices of the administrative faculty, i.e. the Director, Deputy Director, most of the Deans, and also various other professors. The construction started while most of us were at our homes, and without any doubt, it has been rapid – the fully-functional building would be handed back to the institute tentatively before the end of this year. The tender cost of this 6-floor complex is roughly Rs. 31 crores.",
      "We also have a new hostel coming up! The location of Hall 14 lies beyond Hall 13, on the diagonal road. Although we do not know much about the tender and the contract, the buildings are supposed to be handed over by January 2023, though delays might shift the deadline to the end of the even semester of 2022-23.",
      "Also, just like Hall 13 with A-B-C blocks being functional even before the blocks D-E-F were fully constructed, there’s a possibility that Hall 14 would also be built in parts, with one-half being functional even before 2023. Well, aren’t we excited!",

      "In part 1 and part 2 of the series ‘How Mess Functions at IIT Kanpur’, an attempt has been made to familiarize the new incoming students with the functioning of mess. Inpart 1the financial and managerial aspects were discussed with emphasis on MEC, monthly bill, and the role of HECs and residents. Inpart 2, the working condition of mess workers and labor law violations at messes were the focus of our analysis.",
      "In this part, we will be discussing the Per Student Per Day (PSPD) Model. After the restart of the campus following the prolonged closure due to COVID, students noticed a sharp increase in monthly mess bills. Students in many halls have started raising this issue at different levels. FCT is of the opinion that the sudden increase in the monthly mess bill is primarily due to the absence of working HECs in halls. After the restart of the messes, Halls were working either with a few old HEC members (as many had already finished their tenure) or there was no HEC at all. While the  price rise of the raw material partly explains the steep rise in BDMR, it is also a reality that the active involvement of students and HEC in mess affairs can keep the monthly bill under control. During the initial months of restart of the messes the monthly mess bills were as high Rs 110-115. At that time, the messes were following a menu prepared by the DoSA office without any consultation with students. Absence of a functioning HEC meant the students had little control over the procurement process of raw materials. In more recent times with the active involvement of HECs, BDMR has stabilized between Rs 70-80. But the fact remains that BDMR in post-pandemic time is considerably higher compared to pre-pandemic days. With the rising number of students asking about increased mess bills, the IIT-K administration is planning to introduce an alternative mess model. This alternative mess model was first introduced in 2017 and then again in 2019. On both occasions, the institute had to take back the proposals due to many limitations of that model and all-out students’ opposition.",
      "The postponement of the mess contracts renewal for three months, which was due in February has further raised concern among the students. In May, when this renewal is planned, the majority of students will not be on campus due to semester break. In the absence of students, the institute gets a free hand to implement this new model without any consultations with or resistance from the students.  As students are the primary stakeholders in the mess, they need to understand this new model to prevent its imposition in their absence.",
      "To understand the PSPD model, we must first examine thetender document of 2017which invited bids for both the Fixed Cost Service Charge ((FCSC) present mess model) and Per Student Per day (PSPD) model. Point-wise analysis of this tender document is presented below.",
      "1. The difference in the commodity of bidding(refer to points 3(a) & 3(b) of part-1 of the tender document)",
      "2. Differences in the employment of workers(refer to points 26 & 27 of part-1 of the tender document)",
      "3. Mode of payment to the vendors(refer to point 39 of part-2 of the tender document)",
      "4. Utilization of money collected from cash coupon sale(refer to point 53 of part-2 of the tender document)",
      "Based on the provisions, terms, and conditions mentioned in the tender document, we must examine how PSPD is going to affect its different stakeholders and how their roles change if this new mess model is implemented.",
      "Inpart 2of the series on ‘How Mess Functions at IIT Kanpur’, we have discussed the working condition of the mess workers under the present mess model i.e., the FCSC model. It has been laid out that there is a gross violation of labor laws in the present system where for 450 students 40 workers are employed to run a mess facility. These workers are made to work for as high as 11 hours in a workday of 16 hours without any payment of overtime wages.",
      "In the PSPD model, the administration has asked the contractors to get the same job done by 25 workers. The work that 40 workers do in the present model is supposed to be performed by 25 in the PSPD model. What is the rationale here for such a drastic reduction in the number of workers? Is it possible for 25 workers to perform the work of 40 workers without further violation of labor laws? The PSPD model paves the way for the more aggressive and naked transgression of labor laws.",
      "In 2019 students had analyzed the PSPD model and submitted the petition titled ‘Analysis of Per Student Per Day (PSPD) mess model and petition to withdraw it from the tender document’ along with the signatures of around 3000 undergrad and postgrad students to the IITK-administration urging that the PSPD model must be scrapped. At the same time, the opposition to this new model not only came from students but also from other campus community members like faculty members and workers.Hamara Manch, a forum for the workers of the campus also published a note titled “New Model in Hostel Messes: High Cost of Cheap Food” on the introduction of PSPD in hall mess facilities highlighting its shortcomings.",
      "Recently, some of the students have been informed by the CoSHA convenor that the institute administration had initiated the process for PSPD implementation in November 2021 by calling quotations from the contractors. Since November, no formal communication has been made from the administration to the students. It is very unfortunate that such a major change in mess policy is being planned without taking the views of the students who are the primary users of the mess facilities.",
      "Given the above, the students must come together as one voice and demand answers to the following from the administration:",
      "Students must discuss this issue with HECs and through them, resolutions rejecting the PSPD model must be passed at hall levels as well as CoSHA, and Students’ Senate level.",
      "We will end this part with the following questions to the students:",
      "Written by: Forum of Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK)",
      "Forum of Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK) is an informal group of IIT Kanpur students and community members aiming to develop a critical understanding of issues facing the institute and the country. FCT-IITK formed out of a series of discussions amongst students who were concerned about the erosion of democratic values both within the campus and in the country. This forum aims to understand the systemic reasons that underlie the problems faced by the campus community, and attempts to understand it in relation to the socio-political context we occupy within the larger body politic of the nation.

    "title": "How Mess functions at IITK – Part 2: Invisiblization of Labor at Mess",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",

    "content": [
      "In thefirst partof this series of articles, we gave a detailed account of the functioning of messes at IIT Kanpur (IITK). We explained in detail how the mess establishment charge (MEC) and the monthly mess bill are calculated. Furthermore, our account included how the money collected from the students as MEC and the monthly bill is spent to pay the workers, contractors, and vendors. Additionally, we discussed the role HECs, students, contractors, wardens, and IITK administration play in the functioning of the mess facility. The important takeaway points from the previous part are as follows:",
      "BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material in a month/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month",
      "Monthly mess bill = (BDMR x Number of days in the month) + Extra Food Items Purchased + HDF",
      "",
      "Another key point of the previous part was that it is the HECs and residents who play a key role in the management of all the mess affairs such as the selection of contractors, selection of vendors, quality of raw materials, mess menu, etc. The students need to remember that they pay for everything in the mess and they must ensure that the control of management remains with them to ensure good quality food at affordable prices.",
      "In this part, we talk about the workers, whose labor makes sure that we are served fresh and hygienic food thrice a day. The workers of the mess found little mention in the previous report as their participation in the daily functioning of the mess calls for greater attention and focus.",
      "The HECs, wardens, and concerned IITK officials such as DoSA, and ADHA engage in the mess affairs for a limited period. An elected HEC’s involvement continues for one year and that of the wardens & concerned IITK officials, for three years only. The mess workers are the only experienced members whose practical knowledge about the workings of a mess surpasses others. Many workers have been working in the messes of IITK for as long as 15 years. It is these experienced workers who make possible the smooth functioning of mess daily. This second part will cover the mess work and working conditions of the mess workers in detail.",
      "As per the current Fixed Cost Service Model (FCSC), every year the institute invites tenders for providing services for all the messes. The contractor who qualifies the technical and financial bid during the tendering process is selected for providing services by an individual hall based on experience and the lowest financial bid. The financial bid includes the minimum wages of the worker to be employed in the mess and the service charge (profit of contractor).",
      "The only role played by the contractor in the running of the mess is employing the required number of workers in the mess to ensure smooth functioning while following the labor laws. The contractor hires the mess staff which includes a mess manager, mess accountant, mess storekeeper, supervisor, cook, and workers involved in cooking and serving food. The hired workers are deployed in the kitchen or service area based on their experience and expertise. The contractors are the final authority to hire and dismiss the workers from employment.",
      "As mentioned above, the mess workers are the only experienced stakeholders involved in the functioning of the mess. This experience and coordination among workers are very vital for the proper functioning of the mess. It takes a lot of time to train a new worker according to the working system of IITK messes. If every year a new contractor deploys a new workforce, it can hamper the smooth functioning of the mess. The services can become chaotic till the recruits gain enough experience of the working condition and nature of the services required at the mess. To ensure that no such condition arises in the mess, the workers of all the messes are retained even though contractors are changed.",
      "It is through the continuous engagement of the HECs, hall residents, mess workers, and campus community that the wardens and admin have come to an informal agreement that workers are to be retained for a seamless service in the mess. At times when the requirement for new workers arises, the contractor recruits workers. In case the number of workers is higher than the required number in a hall they are transferred to another hall wherever there is a similar requirement. HECs and administration must ensure that no malpractices such as favoritism and corruption take place during employment and deployment of workers by regularly issuing necessary directives to halls and contractors.",
      "Mess workers are the backbone of the functioning of the mess facilities at IITK. Their work includes:",
      "IIT Kanpur is mandated by The Minimum Wages Act 1948 and The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 to pay all contractual workers the central minimum wage. For each workday, a mess worker is paid the central minimum wage, which is Rs 654 for unskilled workers, Rs 724 for semi-skilled workers (assistant cook, cashier, assistant storekeeper, non-veg cook), skilled workers Rs 795 (Head cook, accountant, supervisor, and head storekeeper), Rs 864 for the highly skilled worker (Manager).",
      "Apart from the salary, the workers are entitled to social benefits in the form of Provident Fund (PF) and health insurance through Employee State Insurance (ESI) that contractors deposit in the workers’ accounts at Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation respectively.",
      "Here, we would like to mention that the minimum wages and other benefits for the workers are the product of a long struggle of workers and the concerned campus community, and their continuation depends on continued vigilance and engagement by all the stakeholders.",
      "Though much attention is given to the taste and quality of the food, very little is talked about the workers who toil through the day and run the mess. We feel the students, the primary users of the mess facility should be aware of the ground realities of the working conditions in messes.",
      "Messes at IITK work on an arbitrarily fixed ratio of one mess worker per 11.25 students. The contractor is bound to maintain this ratio, as per the contract. To understand how the present ratio works, let us assume that a hall of residence Y houses 450 residents. As per the ratio of (1:11.25), 40 workers must be present at work every day. Taking into consideration that each worker is supposed to get 4 days off in a month, a hall must employ 47 workers for 450 students.",
      "Workers are supposed to reach the hall mess before 6 am and start their work and they leave around 10 pm, taking only a couple of hours of breaks in between. The timing for mess services for residents is 7:30 am to 10:00 am for breakfast (8 to 10:30 am on weekends), 12:30 pm to 2:30 pm for lunch, and 7:30 pm to 9:30 pm for dinners. Workers are supposed to be present in the mess around 1.5 hours before the service of food to the residents. A worker for the breakfast comes to the mess at around 6 am and leaves around 10:30 am, after preparing and serving the breakfast and performing the necessary required work for the preparation of lunch. These workers again report to the mess at noon for lunch preparations and services and leave around 3:00 pm, after preparing and serving the lunch and performing the requirements for the preparation of dinner. At 6:30 pm workers again return to work for dinner preparation and services and leave at 10:00 pm after ensuring the necessary preparations for the next morning’s breakfast. In this way, a worker spends around 10.5 hours at work each day. However, the workers are engaged in the mess for more than 16.0 hours a day, since in their rest time they cannot work or engage themselves in any other activity. This 10.5 hours of day’s work is counted as one working day for the workers. This is a clear violation of labor law mandated for a central organization to be followed.",
      "Section 24ofThe Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950says that: the number of hours of work that shall constitute a normal working day.",
      "As perpoint a, ofsection 24, the workers who are supposed to work for a maximum of 9 hours are made to work 10.5 hours daily. Whereas, aspoint bmandates that the working day of a worker shall not exceed 12 hours after including the time of rest, here in IITK the working days of the workers go up to 16.5 hours.",
      "Further,Section 25(1)ofThe Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950says that: When a worker works in employment for more than nine hours on any day or for more than forty-eight hours in any week, he/she shall in respect of overtime work, be entitled to wages:",
      "Here also, even though the working hours and the working days of the mess workers exceed the time frame for normal working hours/day, the workers are not paid for overtime work that they perform every day. These above-mentioned violations of labor laws are not paid the attention that they require.",
      "The overburdening of work for the mess workers is not just limited to extended working hours. The ever-increasing mess menus further add to the workload of these workers. By adding multiple special items to the menu, the HECs and the mess committee (the residents) force the workers to prepare more food items in that given time. For a mess worker more special items simply mean more unpaid work since they are given no overtime for the extra work.",
      "The workers prepare and serve food not just for hall residents but also for the visitors from other halls, SBRA, RA tower, etc. Effectively, workers are further forced to work extra without being paid. Here, it is important to mention that the money collected by serving food to the non-hall residents is used to decrease the BDMR of the hall residents, whereas the workers who work extra to serve these guests get nothing from this money. This situation is further aggravated during the institute festivals like Antaragani & Techkriti where the number of non-IITK guests increases manifolds.",
      "Here in the case of extra coupons sold to non-residential guests, it is important to remind ourselves that the workers are employed strictly according to the number of residents residing in the hall on a particular day (as per the 1:11.25 ratio). The food prepared for and served to the non-residents is not part of the calculations for the employment of workers. So, in this way, the services provided by the workers to these guests are simple unpaid work.",
      "Beyond this everyday exploitation, on occasions like the Hall Day celebrations, apart from preparing the regular breakfast and lunch, the mess workers are forced to prepare the ‘gala dinner’ for as high as 1000 guests. For these so-called gala dinners, they are engaged in food preparations from at least one day before hall day. Not only is their labor unpaid, in most cases, but they also are not even offered a respectful plate of dinner and are asked to eatwhatever is left in the end.",
      "As discussed in the above section, the working conditions of the mess workers are over-exploitative and underpaid according to the labor laws of the country. A serious discussion among the students and the other campus community on this issue is completely missing. Most of the discussions of the HECs, the mess committee, and the residents are limited to taste, quality, and the elaborate menu only. On the other hand, IITK admin through its activities such as the attempt to implementPer Student Per day (PSPD)mess model and through recommendations in the section[Sec 9 (b)] of the HMC report, 2021seems determined to create more exploitative conditions for the workers. The working conditions of mess workers, and their physical and mental well-being is never part of any serious discussion at any platform of this institute of national importance.",
      "This is the situation of the mess workers under the present working model(Fixed Cost Service Model (FCSC))of the hall mess facilities on the campus. Intending to make new students on the campus familiar with the mess functioning, we have presented the whole functioning of messes through a detailed discussion of MEC, the monthly mess bill, how BDMR is calculated, the roles of residents and HEC in mess affairs along with the role and working conditions of workers in the messes. We have stressed in the last part that the students must take a proactive role in every aspect of the functioning of the mess to ensure healthy food at affordable prices for all residents. Here also,we urge the residents to widen the scope of their discussion about the mess. A more holistic discussion should take into consideration the mess workers’ perspectives on the working conditions and other issues related to their workspace. Since students primarily avail the services provided by the workers, it is the responsibility of the student community to ensure that IIT Kanpur as a principal employer makes sure that no violation of labor law takes place, and all the workers are provided with the minimum wages, health and social benefits that they are legally entitled to.",
      "In the next part of this series of articles, we will be presenting our view on how the present mess model can be improved along with the analysis of an alternative mess modelPer Student Per day (PSPD)or the thali system. It is important to understand the PSPD system since it has been proposed twice by the administration and has not been implemented primarily due to the opposition from the students.",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a tough time for the majority of us. IIT Kanpur (IITK) was also not shielded from the adverse conditions that arose during the pandemic. Two academic batches at IIT Kanpur had to start their program while not being on campus, in fully online mode. They started their academic journey in a new institute without really knowing the campus ecosystem, both academic and nonacademic. The pandemic and subsequent closure of the campus left no scope for formal and informal interactions between the newer and older batches of students. In pre-pandemic times it was through these organic exchanges and interactions amongst different batches of students that the newer ones used to get initiated in different facets of campus life. One such aspect during their stay on the campus is the functioning of the mess in the halls of residence. After the third wave of the pandemic, the campus is trying to go back to the offline mode of education. Other aspects of campus life are returning to normal. In this regard it is important for the new students to understand how the Mess functions in Halls of Residence at IIT Kanpur. A proper functioning Mess is an essential requirement for its residents to concentrate on their academic affairs. We, at Forum for Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK), take this opportunity to pen down the details regarding the functioning of Mess. In this first part of a series of articles we intend to publish, we shall be discussing the Fixed Cost Service Model that is being followed throughout the messes of IITK. We shall try to briefly explain the roles of various entities in the running of the mess and discuss the financial part of its functioning to understand how our money is being used. In the upcoming parts, we shall be discussing the different approaches that can be adopted to further strengthen this model. One part will be dedicated to analyzing a mess model called ‘Per Student Per Day’ (PSPD) proposed in 2017 and 2019 but withdrawn after students’ opposition to it.",
      "The present mess model of IIT-K is namedFixed Cost Service Model(FCSC).  After joining IITK, registered students are allotted different halls for their stay at the campus. IITK being an all-residential campus, all the registered students must join the hall and mess except for special cases with permission from the Dean of Students Affairs’ (DoSA) office. On joining Hall, its residents are automatically registered for the mess.",
      "Students staying in a Hall are supposed to pay the following charges for availing of mess services:",
      "Mess Establishment Charges",
      "Students are supposed to pay MEC each semester along with the semester fee. MEC for the regular semester is around Rs 13,000 and for those staying on campus in the summer semester, the MEC is around Rs 6,400. One part of MEC consists of salaries and benefits (Employee State Insurance (ESI), Provident Fund (PF)) for the workers employed in hall messes and the remaining is the service charge  (8-11%) paid to the mess contractor for providing services in managing the mess operations. Here it is important to note that the normal semester runs for five months for postgraduate students and for four months for undergraduates.",
      "IIT Kanpur is mandated byThe Minimum Wages Act 1948andThe Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950to pay all contractual workers the central minimum wage. This central minimum wage is revised twice a year in April and October based on the inflation rates and other parameters by the Union government. Every month the mess contractor raises the bill/invoice based on the total number of workers (based on man-days) employed in the mess. This bill also contains the service charges which are payable to the contractor. In simple words, the service charge is the profit of the mess contractor. Let us take an example to understand this structure of Invoice. Let’s assume a Hall of Residence Y has 450 students residing and availing the mess facility. For these 450 students, 40 mess workers will be deployed to ensure the proper functioning of the mess for three meals a day. Since mess runs for all the days in a month, the total man-days become (40×30=1200) for a month of 30 days. At present, the central minimum wage is Rs 645 for unskilled workers. Let us assume here for the simplification of calculation that only unskilled workers are employed in the mess. For 1200 man-days the total wage component becomes Rs 7,74,000. If the service charge is 8% (assume), it becomes Rs 61,920. The total invoice cost will be Rs 9,86,385 for a month inclusive of 18% GST(Rs 1,50,465). Based on this bill, the DoSA office will release the monthly payment to the contractor from the MEC collected from the students in the semester fee. Apart from this, the institute also reimburses the mess contractor the amount of Rs 92,880 (12% of workers’ salary) for Provident Fund (PF) and Rs 29,025 (3.75% of workers’ salary) for Employee State Insurance (ESI) that contractor deposit in the workers’ accounts atEmployees’ Provident Fund OrganizationandEmployees’ State Insurance Corporationrespectively. This amount is also paid by the DoSA office from the MEC charges collected from the students. Mess Establishment Charge (MEC) simply is the labor cost (including social benefits) and service charge paid by the students for services they avail themselves of at the mess.",
      "Monthly Mess Bill",
      "Apart from the MEC, students are supposed to pay the mess bill every month to the hall account. Following are the four main components of the monthly mess bill:",
      "Monthly mess bill = (BDMR x Number of days in the month) + Extra Food Items Purchased + HDF",
      "Basic Daily Meal Rate (BDMR)",
      "‘Basic daily meal’ (BDM) includes food items consumed by residents in breakfast (such as daily changing items like poha, dosa-sambar, sandwiches, etc. along with regulars like daliya, sprouts, egg, milk, tea, etc.), lunch, and dinner (one dal, one sabzi, rice, chapati, sambar, fruits, etc.). This basic daily meal does not include the items cooked on the order of individual residents (Omelette, paneer bhujia fried rice, etc.).To run the mess, every hall purchases all the necessary raw items required for the food preparation. Different vendors supply the hall with all the necessary raw materials against the order raised by the Mess or the hall office. The total expenditure on the monthly BDM is divided by the total number of residents to obtain the BDMR. BDMR is the average cost of food per day in a given month.",
      "BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material in a month/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month",
      "This BDMR excludes the money generated by the mess of selling external coupons. This BDMR gets modified after these coupons are taken into consideration during calculations. This will be discussed in the coming section.",
      "Hall Development Fund (HDF)",
      "HDF, also called ‘Establishment Charge’ in some halls, is collected by the hall every month from its residents. HDF varies from hall to hall and is usually between Rs. 40-75. This fund is used for carrying out different maintenance works and purchases in the hall.",
      "Extra food items purchased",
      "Apart from basic daily meals, residents of the hall can purchase extra food items such as egg, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian items. These items are prepared on the order placed in the mess. The cost of these items is decided by the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) in consultation with mess managers.",
      "External coupons",
      "Campus community members like other hall residents, SBRA residents, research assistants (RAs), staff, and faculty can also use the hall mess facilities. These non-hall-residents are required to purchase cash coupons for every meal they take at the mess. The cost of these items is decided by the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) in consultation with mess managers. The cost of these coupons is higher than the BDMR paid by the regular residents of the hall. Further, the total amount of these coupons sold is deducted from the total expenditure on the raw material done by the hall. This makes the final BDMR calculation formula as:",
      "BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material – Total collection from cash coupons/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month",
      "Mess Rebate",
      "Mess rebate is applicable when a student leaves the campus on a personal, medical, or academic leave for more than 3 days. The rules for mess rebate are drafted by hall HECs and vary from hall to hall. For example, if a student leaves campus for 7 days in a month of 30, then the mess bill is calculated only for the number of days that the student has taken the food at the mess, i.e., 23 days in this example. This makes the final monthly mess bill calculation formula as:",
      "Monthly Mess Bill = (BDMR x No. of days food taken) + Extra Items purchased + HDF",
      "Above is the overview of the different fees and bills students pay at IITK to avail of mess facilities. In the next section, we will be discussing the role played by the contractor, students’ HEC, and Hall residents. wardens and IITK administration in ensuring the smooth and transparent functioning of the hall.",
      "Role of Different Stakeholders in the Mess",
      "HECs are the executive student bodies of each hall of residence elected every year by hall residents. The main purpose of HEC is to represent the hall residents in every decision-making related to the hall. Mess facility is one such avenue that requires the active participation of the HEC. HEC consists of two to three mess secretaries among others. The mess secretaries further form a mess committee by calling nominations from the hall residents. These volunteers help mess secretaries in managing day to day activities of the mess in a smooth manner.",
      "Following are the essential responsibilities of HEC and the mess committee:",
      "Residents are the primary users of the mess. To ensure the proper functioning of the mess, residents must actively participate in the mess affairs. Residents must provide HEC with essential feedback on mess-related issues from time to time. Residents must hold their elected HEC members accountable for the transparency in the functioning of mess affairs. Residents must ensure that HEC is performing its roles as mentioned above (see “role of HEC”). Residents must provide support to HEC to make sure that their voices are heard at platforms such as HMC, CoSHA & SS.",
      "The mess is a form of community kitchen where residents from different regions, food habits, and economic backgrounds have their food. Every resident must keep in mind that mess provides only basic food and it cannot function like restaurants. Every individual choice of food cannot always be accommodated due to different constraints such as cost of food, seasonal availability of vegetables and fruits, training of cook in food preparation, etc. Residents must be reasonable while presenting their opinions to the HEC members and must never forget that HEC members are fellow students who are devoting their valuable time voluntarily to their academics, so that mess can function smoothly for everyone’s benefit.",
      "The service of every mess facility at IIT Kanpur has been outsourced to the contractors, who provide services and manage the daily functioning of the mess. Contractors have to ensure that the required number of workers needed to run the mess facility in the hall are employed every day. The contractor is responsible for the timely preparation of food, the cleanliness of the kitchen and dining area. The contractor through its manager in coordination with hall HEC ensures the smooth functioning of the mess facility.",
      "Every contractor is responsible to ensure that for every 11.25 residents 1 worker is employed in the mess. The contractor must pay the salaries according tothe minimum wage act of 1948andThe Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950to every worker by the first week of every month. The contractor must make sure that they are depositing the ESI & provident fund of workers to concerned government departments regularly. The contractor must facilitate the paperwork regarding salaries, ESI, and PF. The contractor must address the grievances of the workers as and when they are reported.",
      "For the services provided by the contractor in the mess, it is paid a fixed service charge decided during the allocation of the contract through a tendering process.",
      "Each hall of residence has three faculty members as wardens appointed by institute administration on the recommendation of HECs. Each hall has a dedicated warden for mess affairs to advise HEC and the mess committee regarding the functioning of the mess facility as and when asked for.  Wardens are the signing authority for the banking affairs for the payments to the vendors and other service providers.",
      "Following are the essential responsibilities performed by IITK administration through the offices of DoSA, ADHA, and wardens:",
      "This is the overall functioning of the present working model of the hall mess facilities on the campus. From the students’ point of view, the strength of the present mess model is that at every step, the participation of the students (primary service users) is ensured. Students actively participate in the selection of new contractors, selection of vendors, deciding food quality, mess menu, etc. The effective participation from HECs and residents can ensure that they are served quality food at a low price in the mess, as they are the main decision-makers in the mess affairs. This mess model is also very convenient for the IITK administration as students share a majority of the day-to-day responsibilities necessary for the smooth functioning of the mess facilities on the campus. This system is very important from the point of view of the workers whose hard labor makes sure that we are served food well on time every day. This system ensures that they are paid with central government-mandated minimum wages along with social benefits of provident fund and the health security scheme of ESI.",
      "Having said that, we do not imply that this present mess model of the ‘Fixed Cost Service Model’ (FCSC) has no shortcomings and there is no scope for improvement in it. In the coming parts of this series of articles, we will be presenting our view on the scope of improvement in this mess model. Along with that, we will be presenting the analysis of the ‘Per Student Per Day’ (PSPD) model that has been rejected by the students in 2017 & 2019.",
      "Written by: Forum of Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK)",
      "Forum of Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK) is an informal group of IIT Kanpur students and community members aiming to develop a critical understanding of issues facing the institute and the country. FCT-IITK formed out of a series of discussions amongst students who were concerned about the erosion of democratic values both within the campus and in the country. This forum aims to understand the systemic reasons that underlie the problems faced by the campus community, and attempts to understand it in relation to the socio-political context we occupy within the larger body politic of the nation.

      "As the third wave of the pandemic began picking pace across India, students had just returned from their homes to start their new year on campus. The warm reunion did come with the tiny virus grabbing a handful of residents and sending them into a week of isolation at the Yoga Hall. Here’s an account of what their stay at the facility looked like.",
      "“Bhaiya, ambulance neeche aa gayi hai, jaldi aaiye.” And there it began.",
      "When one reaches New SAC, you come here hoping quarantine isn’t a big deal. You see, there’s the OAT tower. The OAT. A place you’ve associated with unabated bustle and human activity, from the experiences you’ve had in your brief week-long campus safari. You expect this place is going to hold up to the reputation of its noisy neighbours. However, things change when you enter, tch, the Yoga Hall enters you.",
      "The first impression is – “What a sad place, man.” It’s fifty beds, half clad, half unclad. Around ten beds are occupied. Except a few staring at their laptops, all are asleep in Indian Railways-esque blankets. You look up at the ceiling scaffolding and the vacuity of your surroundings resonates with how quarantine feels. Hollow. You try to look for a suitable bed but you realise that all the beds along the boundary of the hall have been occupied because those are the only spots where you can have a power outlet nearby. You do notice a single extension line running along the middle of the hall that has been hastily taped to the ground (they seem to take pride in the fact that they tried) only to realise afterwards that the line is unplugged and doesn’t have a outlet to plug into, anywhere in the room. Now not just you, your dying electronics are disappointed too.",
      "And you’re fatigued. And hungry. You can hear a muffled announcement from the SIS Guard at the gate, in a language certainly not recognizable to you (only to discover later it was Hindi and the guard was announcing the arrival of meals from the mess). A few others have their plates in hand, but you have absolutely no idea how to get yours. It was only on the direction of a generous neighbour that you figured you had to call your mess manager for food. After all this, it calls for a break on the only real estate you own here – your bed. Psych, mosquitoes and no power outlets for your repellent vaporisers. It’s not a lot of time before you realise that this place is gonna get cold in the night. But no heaters.",
      "This is just the beginning and you are absolutely oblivious about what is going to unfold in the coming days.",
      "Considering this part of my quarantine overlapped with a dreary weekend with despondent rain, it called for a mental breakdown of sorts. You realise that monotony has set in when the conversations in your dreams start out as, “Hum Kanpur Medical cell se call kar rahe aapki tabiyat kaisi hai?”. The only notifications which excite you anymore are texts from HC saying, “Please send vitals”. You know something is wrong when it doesn’t seem to make a difference whether you are entering the gents’ or ladies’ washrooms because it’s not like either of them is cleaner and you’re too lousy and ignorant to care. You suddenly feel like a sick patient in a hospital measuring your temperature and SpO2 and swallowing meds all day. Yoga hall even gets to your academics when you compare your lab temperature readings to your body temperature. The entire place feels like a big sauna bath instead, because of all the steam from the kettles. Like the case with all mid-whatever crises, the monotony calls for changes and new experiences. The most favourable of these being the fact that more people are coming into the yoga hall and you get to play the ‘reverse-baapu’ role, showing your seniors around the place and initiating them into the yoga hall quarantine regime.",
      "News spread in town, err, the hall, that one of our co-residents had typed in a furiously inspired mail to the DoSA complaining about the sheer mismanagement of this place. And that’s why supposedly there are now heaters across the room. The extension line has been plugged somewhere as the middle rows have started to populate. People have started to bring their own extension cords and the whole place has started to look like a cobweb of charger and water kettle cables lying beside extension cords looking for their kettle partner.",
      "Among other news that spread, there seems to have been a guideline released by the Central Government, stating asymptomatic cases are allowed to exit after seven days of home isolation without retesting. This comes as a big relief to us, as the medical prescription would have otherwise suggested a stay of a minimum of ten days, and that most of us have almost fully recovered from all the symptoms. This may have also marked an overall mood transformation of this entire place, as this hall starts to feel…less hollow.",
      "More people. More energy in the place. Still grim throughout the day, but better. At this instant, we are done, and are looking for methods of refuge from outside. Pizza deliveries fromDomino’sand waffles fromThe Chocolate Roomhave started coming in. It’s almost as if people are graduating out of Yoga Hall. A lot of people are getting comfort stuff fetched by their fellows outside the gate – including packed eatables from the E-shop and mineral water bottles – for the tap drinking water at the Yoga Hall has desensitised our taste buds. Among all that, badminton racquets have also been smuggled in, so the dry and empty foyer has been changed into a badminton court facility. A high chair has been found on the first floor and is now repurposed as a referee’s chair. Alongside that, people are starting to sit on the stairs with their laptops and chai, having light-hearted discussions with the occasional laugh that reaches the quarantine area. That doesn’t mean people inside the quarantine area are not having fun – we can spot an odd group playingUNOand a few in a huddle, sharing their dishes from the extras menus of their messes.",
      "In latest unfoldings, it has also been discovered that the speaker system the SIS guard uses, has a spare mic that lies in plain sight and it has now been hidden in a secret vault away from the guard’s access and is being used for… obvious purposes, primarily with the objective of having fun. The speaker system also has Bluetooth and that means the foyer has become a place for jamming to music as well. The whole place feels different now.",
      "A path has also been tracked down that connects the girls’ quarantine hall to the boys’ quarantine hall, so the odd friend group (or couple) can also be spotted near the rock-climbing area of New SAC. The whole place feels as if it’s crawling back to normalcy by virtue of the cheer creeping into people’s hearts. Quarantine isn’t so bad after all.",
      "Humans have always been known to find out means to overcome the adversities in their life and livelihood. Probably the greatest capability of the human race lies in how we manipulate and consciously mould our surroundings to suit us. So was the case with Yoga Hall and its transition from gloominess to liveliness.",

    "title": "A Year of the New DoSA Office",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",

      "Prof. Siddharth Panda took charge as the Dean of Student Affairs on October 1, 2020. On the one year anniversary of the new DoSA office, we would like to take a look at various things that have changed and been implemented in the eventful past year by the DoSA office under Prof. Panda’s leadership, thus enhancing the student’s experience and easing the processes.",
      "Before becoming the DoSA, Prof. Panda was the Techkriti ’20 Festival Chairman and proactively associated with the then student’s core team to understand and resolve various on-ground issues faced by students in festival bodies. After assuming the position of the DoSA, he directed all DoSA office officials towards devising collaborative measures, and brought about a much-needed ideology shift where fests are viewed as IITK’s prestigious events rather than mere student activities. This became a key in not only handling the logistics to conduct festivals, but also maintain the standard according to IIT Kanpur’s stature. One of the phenomenal initiatives was the maintenance of a constant feedback loop from the student bodies, which led to identification, addressing and quick resolution of all existing problems.",
      "A major result of his efforts in this field is reflected by the fact that the accountability and promptness of the DoSA office towards festival issues has increased significantly. One of the parameters that highlight the success is the reduction of Turn-Around Time (TAT) to 5 working days from 20 working days, and our DoSA aims to reduce it down to 48 hours for any problem. There has been a drastic enhancement in the transparency and efficient management of financial accounts of festivals from the past DoSA.",
      "The most prominent issue prevalent in the history of all festivals was the carrying over of work and dues from past editions of festivals leading to massive delays in planning of current editions and constant pestering to students.This has now been completely solved by the DoSA. Overall, the processes have been outlined and guidelines have been structured, and the vision of aligning festivals with IIT Kanpur’s vision thus bridging student activities with a long term mission of IIT Kanpur has come into play under Prof. Panda’s able leadership.",
      "After the first wave of COVID had subsided in the country, numerous committees were formed to streamline the return of students back to campus starting September 2020. Although Prof. Panda officially became DoSA on 1st October 2020, he along with other committee members played a pivotal role in bringing back the students and resuming normal operations in the campus in the aforementioned committees. His office in tandem with offices of DoAD, Security, DoIP, and Health Centre devised ways to ensure that the students could start coming back without any major hassles.",
      "The proactive attitude of the DoSA office led to the return of students in a phased manner, thus making it a stand-out decision in an unprecedented and challenging situation. Proper SoPs were laid out which realistically made the return a carefully planned event. DoSA ensured and instructed all officials to promote regular sanitization, proper quarantine and availability of adequate infrastructure making the stays of the students hassle-free. When the infamous decision to send back the students was taken in April 2021 due to the onset of the deadly second wave, DoSA and the concerned offices arranged for important supplies such as masks, face shields, medicines etc. as well as conducting RT-PCR tests, aiming for the safe transportation of students.After the second wave had died down, the DoSA office became fully engaged in managing the return of students back to campus. A separate batch of resource-constrained students was also called back to campus – a decision that DoSA supported Students’ Gymkhana. He maintained a rapport with students through constant interactions over problems and student’s apprehensions and worked towards resolving them on the highest priority. “Our 50-minute discussion classes often stretched to 2-3 hour-long discussions in which sir talked to us in the capacity of a regular person, rather than in the capacity of DoSA or a course instructor.”, said Ayush Anand, a 2nd-year student enrolled in the CHE251 course under Prof. Panda.",
      "Once the students had been sent back, DoSA felt there was a need for structure in student affairs similar to that in academic affairs, implementing a ground-up mechanism that ensures a more democratic process for decision-making. Thus, ISAC (Institute Student Affairs Committee) and DSAC (Department Student Affairs Committee) were born. Apart from a convener, DSAC has student nominees. This is in line with DoSA’s belief in student governance. ISAC and DSAC function as strong recommendation bodies working on entry and exit guidelines, quarantine policies and other decisions pertaining to student affairs. The creation of both DSAC and ISAC has led to increased student representation and student voice in decision making over student affairs.",
      "Recently, there was a massive sit-in protest against regressive changes introduced by a committee formed on 16 August 2019. It was before Prof. Panda’s tenure as DoSA, this committee constituted by the HMC was formed. It is to be noted that the recommendations formulated in a report were forwarded to the Chairperson Academic Senate before he assumed the charge for DoSA. This has been further warranted by the statement“(submitted to the Chairperson Senate on September 30, 2020 for admittance in Senate)”in the interim ruling of the Chairperson Academic Senate.",
      "The DoSA himself was at the site of the protest to answer to the student groups and bring light on this issue. Being associated with the IIT culture for a long time, himself being an undergraduate from IITKGP, the DoSA firmly believes in the IITK culture that gives rights to students. He is of the opinion that rights should be given to students & they should go hand in hand with responsibility. He further works with the philosophy that a collaborative effort between the administration and the student bodies can go a long way in building up an accountable, quick and democratic process in IITK.",
      "It is important to understand that DoSA is a facilitator of decisions. DoSA has taken up prompt action to almost all the issues raised by the student representatives. One such key issue was the summer term of 2021. Since the students had missed out on the lab components of the course due to the academics shifting to online mode as per the new normal of covid times, the institute decided to complete the lab components of all the institute core courses in the summers, so no difficulties are faced in future regarding the completion of the degree. Since students need to pay tuition fees for the courses taken up during the summer term, many students felt it was unfair on the part of the institute to demand fees for the courses which would’ve been completed during a normal semester. When the student representatives reached out to DoSA, a decision from the office was conveyed to the campus community regarding the fee waiver. All this happened in a matter of a few hours.",
      "Another major issue addressed promptly by the DoSA was the extension of the deadline for a scholarship. It was due to some clerical error leading to many queries on the part of students. DoSA, again went ahead to help students out with the extension of the deadline to apply for the scholarship.",
      "Earlier the roles of members in the DoSA office were ad hoc and tasks were performed by anyone who would be available at the moment. During the one year of his tenure as the DoSA, Professor Siddharth Panda has been prompt and has segregated the roles of various individuals in the office, increasing the ownership of the work of any individual. Now everyone has a definite set of tasks/queries which they will cater to. Measures have been taken to revamp the DoSA website where contact details of all the members from the DoSA office were shared to help students to reach out to relevant authorities without going through layers of bureaucratic delegations. To improve the efficiency of work and make things easier for the staff, various cells have been formed and each staff member reports to a dean in-charge of their activities. This has made the work environment very friendly for the staff who feel they are being valued for their work and treated well, and ensured a productive environment.",
      "We all acknowledge the vast amount of initiatives and work done by DoSA in a small time of 1 year given the fact that he took charge of the seat in the most challenging times, when not only us but the whole world was facing hardships. We thank him and appreciate the efforts and his constant support to the student body. We are looking forward to having more new developments as he starts with the second innings of his tenure.",

      "Prof. Yogesh Joshi, from the Department of Chemical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, has recently been chosen for the prestigious Academy Excellence Award of the Defense Research and Development Organization. He is presently serving as the Dean of International Relations and Pandit Girish & Sushma Rani Pathak Chair Professor. With his 17 years of service at IIT Kanpur, Dr Joshi has made significant contributions in his field of research and expertise. He is an elected fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering and has a number of awards and honours to his name. He was graced with the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Engineering Sciences for his pioneering scientific research work.",
      "In the following excerpts, Prof. Joshi talks about his journey as a part of the institute, shares experiences from his research career and opines the situation and scope of modern-day undergraduate research interests.",
      "You have been recently chosen for the prestigious Academy Excellence Award of Defence Research and Development Organization. Can you detail us on it and provide some bits of your concerning work?",
      "I cannot detail my DRDO related work given the confidentiality, but I’d like to briefly talk about both experimental and theoretical work undertaken in my field of research.",
      "The thrust of my work is on a topic called ‘Soft Matter’, which, in a very crude language can be defined as a material with modulus less than 1 MPa. Several liquids with significantly high viscosity to soft solids fall under this domain and can be seen in our day-to-day lives as well as in industry. More specifically, I work in the field of ‘Rheology’, wherein essentially the deformation and the flow dynamics of soft materials is studied. Besides practising the fundamental work, we have also been in close association with several agrochemical, petroleum, home-care and personal-care industries for at least 10 years now.",
      "What were your initial goals and expectations at the start of your research career? How has your experience been since then? What has been the most rewarding aspect of your academic career?",
      "While being in an institute like IIT Kanpur, teaching has always been the most rewarding experience for me. One thing which I have immensely enjoyed in the last 17 years is to teach subjects like Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Rheology.",
      "Basically, when it comes to teaching, any subject which has a strong mathematical basis tends to attract me. I also like to bring out the mathematical richness of a particular subject, primarily because it simplifies the concepts even more. Besides, getting involved in research and publishing papers, mentoring the Masters and PhD students has been an important aspect of a faculty’s career.",
      "I did my PhD from IIT Bombay in 2001, and for 3 years I was in New York as a Postdoc. After that, when I was planning to come back to India, my Postdoc advisor suggested, “If you are going back to India, the best place is IIT Kanpur.” Since 2004, I have enjoyed being here and IIT Kanpur is indeed worth it!",
      "You have been a part of IIT Kanpur for 17 years as a faculty member. How has been your experience as a professor? Do you draw out an influence of your teaching in your research work?",
      "I have met very hard-working and dedicated colleagues in the institute who have been a constant source of inspiration for the last 17 years of my work. Seeing them progress through publishing notable papers and making strides in their field of work has motivated me to propel myself forward through these years. The PhD students have contributed a lot to my research work and have been amazing to work with, besides the undergraduate students whose curiosity and dedication have never stopped astonishing me!",
      "I would say, and I believe that excellence is valued at IITK and this place has been nothing short of heaven for me throughout these years.",
      "How do you think the research facilities of the institute have developed and changed over the time period that you have been here?",
      "From the early 2000s, this place has changed so much and for the better. The research facilities and the infrastructure is second to none. And whatever the rankings may say, IIT Kanpur has an excellent environment for the growth of a faculty and any student.",
      "A thing I have often heard of is that IIT Kanpur is more exacting than other IITs, which according to me is definitely an asset and not a liability.",
      "There is a general myth around research that it is not as rewarding as the corporate world and many students tend to deviate from it thereby, what is your say on this?",
      "Academia is a totally different ball game than the corporate world, in fact, both are disparate at their very essence. Some may want to solve industry-level problems in two ways, either by doing corporate research or by indulging in academia. Both the options have their perks and pitfalls, so we can’t conclude whether one is superior to the other. While the industry may give you a higher salary, academia, on the other hand, will give you the option to dictate your research problems.",
      "In academia, “you are your own boss” and you have to make a choice about what you want to do, irrespective of whether someone likes it or not.",
      "How are you coping with your research and teaching strategies in current times, given the limited resources and no real interaction with the students?",
      "While several problems remain tacit in these challenging times; for me, giving online lectures poses a considerable hindrance. While recording lectures, I make it a point to make sure that my PhD students attend them, since there is nothing more dispiriting than simply speaking in front of an empty screen. As for the postgraduate students working with me, I give them theoretical problems, given the present resources constraints. Although this gets significantly abstract, since not all students can proficiently analyse and explore those experimental domains through theoretical fronts, in the present times, we are left with no other option.",
      "You’ve been a visiting professor at numerous institutes over the years; so according to you, what are some aspects where we differ from other institutions on research fronts or have a scope of improvement?",
      "From what I believe in, IIT Kanpur has its own strengths and downsides. While we have a splendid infrastructure and creditable quality of education, we do lack on certain fronts. As a matter of fact, it is generally deemed that the research output of the western universities is far better when compared to the Indian ones. This output is an essential consequence of everyone’s share of work, and it is the hard work component we lack upon.",
      "In the American system, the faculty is taken to an absolute task, i.e. to be confirmed in their job position, they are expected to complete a set of predefined tasks. Other western countries follow the tenure system. This system evaluates the newly recruited and existing faculty members through assessments and impels them to work rigorously throughout their careers.",
      "On average, the postgraduate students abroad are significantly more hardworking than what we find in India. I do feel that Indian academia is not on par with other globally adopted systems, and there certainly lies a scope of improvement. At every juncture, students and faculty members have to improve their work ethics to curb the qualitative difference which stands stark today.",
      "To be successful in academia, you need three things – hard work, hard work and hard work. I believe everyone has more or less similar intellectual capacity, hard work is something that differentiates you from the rest. Even if you are the finest brain, without working righteously, you may end up doing nothing productive in life.",
      "It is quite recent that you’ve become the senior editor of Langmuir – an acclaimed publication of the American Chemical Society. How has your experience been as a part of it?",
      "I consider myself fortunate to be on the Editorial Board of Langmuir. Being the youngest person on board, at times, I do not consider myself to be as worthy as other senior colleagues. It’s a prestigious responsibility and I have to deal with the best possible research papers from anywhere in the world. But from a realistic perspective, it is an honorary job and a greatly learnable experience to cherish for years to come.",
      "In research, there can be days at a stretch when you don’t find something worthwhile and it requires constant patience at one’s end. How did you tackle those days and what keeps you motivated to work during those hours?",
      "There are two aspects of research work – several times we indulge in focused research where the problem is well studied theoretically, and we know about significant parts of the domain. However, for other nebulous fronts of it, the work is focused enough to yield results from the researcher’s end. This is unlike other kinds of research, where one is exploring a field from the start, with a fair chance of failure.",
      "While doing experimental research, one has to be very patient. Getting the results just once is not sufficient; you must have reproducibility of it. This might be coupled with any possible forthcoming difficulty. There can be instances when the instruments may give up and stop working altogether, and one needs to wait to resume the work on the same.",
      "As an experienced faculty member, I am well aware of these aspects, but this can be highly demoralizing for the one who is just beginning a career. Thus we tend to occupy students with both difficult and simple problems so that if something fails, then there is always another thing to look forward to.",
      "As a PhD fellow, you need to have your work done on some good sets of problems. But if you happen to stumble in your project, this often brings discouragement and loss of interest. So as a professor, you need to be in close and continuous contact with the students and guide them through thick and thin.",
      "When one doesn’t succeed, it is not a personal loss, it’s a team loss.",
      "A successful PhD is not about the number of papers you’ve come up with. It is essentially about how successfully you’ve trained yourself in a particular field. That makes the entire difference. Independent thinking, good writing abilities and problem analyzing skills are all part and parcel of doing a PhD and count for success.",
      "How would you comment on the undergraduate research interests in the institute? A number of students have fair research interests but they lack in settling with a decision on whether to pursue it. What do you say about it?",
      "Talking of undergraduate research interests, I believe that if a number of students aren’t enthusiastic to pursue it, then they aren’t the ones solely accountable. Instead, it is a failure on our part as well, for the inefficacy in keeping up with student’s interest in the research environment.",
      "I also feel that students must have a more disciplined life during their academically focused phases. They should be working all over the year and not during the onset of exams. Reading, playing sports and good utilization of time should be practised wisely.",
      "At the end of the day, it’s their life and they are the ones responsible for the decisions they make.",
      "With several coveted awards, fellowships and experience in hand, what are some of the greatest takeaways which you have had from your journey? What would be your advice to the students who want to develop a career in the same?",
      "For any career, one must be prepared to do hard work. One should be observant, possess an inquisitive nature and believe in things only after reasoning them rationally. Blind faith is one of the poisons of research. The practice of reading extensively and developing good writing skills goes a long way.",
      "One should manage time well and be surrounded with good company; set vivid goals and have the conviction that you have taken birth to do great things in life.",

      "As another online semester reaches its mid-way, the lack of access to the Internet and consistent electricity supply has come across as a major bottleneck for the resource-constrained students. Vox Populi talked to resource-constrained undergraduate students across different batches to learn about the challenges they face during the online semesters and the assistance, if any, they have received from the administration.  The stories were narrated to Vox correspondents over phone calls and have been presented as-is. All names have been used with the consent of the concerned students.",
      "Chandra Shekhar(Y19, CE)",
      "I come from Jehanabad, Bihar. In the online semesters, I broadly face three problems: one, I have a very slow internet; two, the electricity supply here is very erroneous and goes off often; and three, my daily expenses in college were reimbursed by an external scholarship I had managed to get. But now at home, since I cannot provide the bills (like mess bills for food), I am unable to avail the scholarship and that has financially affected my family.",
      "Due to frequent blackouts in my area, I nearly missed interviews I was shortlisted for, in the internship season this year. In fact, to give Citi Corp’s interview, I had to go to a friend’s house, which had an inverter.",
      "The response of professors to my problems have been varied, differing from professor to professor. Unfortunately, there is no uniform policy, which the college administration follows about these problems. But most of the professors do not accept email submissions, saying that it isn’t their problem and defer the responsibility to the DoAA. This creates huge trouble for me.",
      "I feel like people who have contacts and more friends are able to perform better during the online semesters. I have very few social contacts and hence, I think I suffer academically due to high averages.",
      "Yes! If I am called back to the campus, most of my problems- electricity supply, slow internet and scholarship- would be solved!",
      "Pratap Singh(Y19, CHE)",
      "I reside in a village in Rajasthan. The internet speed I get here is 0.3 kbps! To put this in perspective, I need to walk 1 kilometre from my village to send a Whatsapp message!",
      "The previous president (Nikunj) had helped me a lot. I used to get offline material in pen drives and my quizzes used to happen over email. However, in the next semester, when the president changed, all of this stopped!(He said he hasn’t contacted the current president with his issues yet).",
      "In addition to the Internet issues, my family’s financial conditions are very poor. Also, I live in a joint family, so my house does not have a proper environment to study. Therefore, I rented a room in the city, where I could get better internet. I stayed there for 3 months, during which time my academic performance significantly improved.",
      "But since we couldn’t afford the room any longer, I have come back now! Due to poor internet access, I cannot watch lectures and have to make do with the downloaded slides.",
      "I also couldn’t prepare for the internship season because all resources were online and thereby, inaccessible to me. Moreover, I couldn’t seek help from friends, since I have lost contact with most of them during the online semester.",
      "Some professors have helped me a lot like Prof. Pankaj Apte had waived some of my quizzes where I faced internet problems. However, some professors are ‘cruel’- they do not allow students in the class after the first 5 minutes and so, I am often left in the waiting room!",
      "I had emailed the DoAA a lot of times about my problems, but have received no reply. The only help I have received was from the previous president.",
      "I believe that I can do much better academically if I get access to better internet. I am doubly vaccinated now and hence, request the administration to call me back to the campus as soon as possible!",

      "I come from a village in Rajasthan and here, we have pathetic internet speed!",
      "With 3 labs every week of 3 hours each, I face a lot of problems due to my internet. Moreover, exams which have proctoring over Zoom or which require submission of large files are very troublesome for me. The other issue is that I live in a house with 24 members – hence, the environment is not exactly conducive for my academic pursuits.",
      "I am very concerned about the upcoming placements because firstly, I am unable to access online resources, thanks to my internet problems. And secondly, I cannot attend long Zoom interviews as my internet gives up after some time!",
      "I have emailed the DoAA and the DoSA multiple times but haven’t received any help from them! The only help I have received is that some professors have given me 10-20 extra minutes for submission, but that was also not allowed by all professors.",
      "<Name Retracted> (Y20,CE)",
      "In my district, there is only one network provider, who provides decent connectivity. However, the tariff plans are substantially expensive. With ‘camera on’ policies being adopted in some of my courses, if we have a couple of classes and an exam on the same day, then rationing of the internet plan becomes a major hassle. In case of a disruption, my instructors have most often not paid any heed to submissions via emails and appeals through forums have not garnered any response.",
      "Additionally, I come from a Hindi-medium school. Although I attended remedial classes, I find it hard to grasp lecture content. In fact, one of my professors also ridiculed Hindi-medium students in a class and called them ‘backward’.",
      "I tried reaching out to the Counselling Service and the Hall Office for help, but I did not receive any concrete response to my concerns and the network connectivity issues still persist.",
      "I think it would be very helpful if the institute provides some financial aid to students facing such issues in the online semester so that we can at least make a substantial effort to catch up with our peers in academics.",
      "Jitesh Sethi(Y20, CHM)",
      "I live in a town in Nagaland and face frequent power cuts. Even today, we didn’t have power for the entire day. In fact, I don’t own a laptop, which means that I have to attend all my classes and appear for my exams with the help of my phone. This is a major bottleneck for me because I faced issues in my first year where I was only able to submit 3-4 pages of my 16-page long answer scripts.",
      "Moreover, I live in a joint family and I don’t have a personal room for attending classes and appearing for exams. There are always people present since we don’t have separate rooms for everyone.",
      "With sporadic internet connectivity and limited facilities, the online semester is tough to keep up with. I had emailed professors in my first year about my concerns but I didn’t get any reply. This semester, I brought my problem up with a professor in class, however, I was told that it wasn’t his domain to act on it and that there was little he could do. There isn’t any formal mechanism in place to ask for any aid in this matter!",
      "Campus reopening would definitely solve most of my problems since a little personal space, ample internet connectivity and appearing for exams would be comparatively very easy than what it is now.",
      "Bhawani Shankar(Y20, ME)",
      "I live in a home with only one room, meaning that some of my family members are often present while I have to take exams or attend classes. Since my home is also near the highway, it becomes quite cumbersome to attend lectures without disturbance. Screen times have increased drastically in the online semester, and health-related concerns like body aches, the strain on the eyes and ears and improper sleep too have affected my academic performance to a significant extent.",
      "The network connectivity issue is very real. I’ve faced disruptions in connectivity during lectures and the problem during exams has led to me losing a lot of marks in the first couple of semesters. I tried to reach out to professors regarding the network connectivity concerns, however, I’ve either not received any reply or have been told that it is my problem to deal with.",
      "With the lab courses this semester, a number of us living in rural cities face a problem since we need to go to the city, which is about 20km from my place, to get the necessary apparatus to complete the experiment. This frequent travel and the unavailability of certain materials in my locality means that I’ve to spend added time and money to be prepared for the coursework. I also know of certain friends who are not able to afford expensive laptops and are facing issues running heavy softwares like AutoDesk Fusion 360, which are mandatory for coursework in my department.",
      "Reopening of campus would mean that several of these problems are solved for resource-constrained students. It’d also help to reduce academic stress on students. Any aid from the administration and the faculty would really help us, students, to make the most out of the coursework we have.",
      "Our opinion",
      "While we could cover only so many students, these problems plague a much larger section of the student community. The online semesters have led to increased inequity, as we all do not have access to the same resources. We believe that calling back resource-constrained students would solve most of these problems, and this should have been prioritised long before. It is welcome to hear from the DoSA (in his email dated 6 September) that discussions to call back resource-constrained students have begun but it remains to be seen when the actual plan materialises.",

      "This interview was originally published by PhDs Of India on 1st September 2021.",
      "PhDs of Indiais a group of scholars who are running an initiative to bring out the stories of research scholars at various Indian institutes who work behind the scenes and contribute steadily to the progress of science, culture and finance.",
      "Do make sure to follow their work at: https://phdsofindia.in/",
      "What was your motivation to pursue engineering and then follow it with a PhD?",
      "I was born and brought up in a family of engineers. That and my love for Mathematics initially influenced me to pursue a BE in Electrical Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I developed an interest in Communications and felt the need to delve more into the topic. So, instead of following the conventional route of taking up a job after engineering, I opted for an MTech at IIT Kanpur. I met some of the best scholars in my field at IITK who transformed my perspective towards research. Therefore, in the hope of doing fundamental communication research, I joined ISRO after my MTech. But I quit after a year and enrolled myself in the PhD program at IIT Kanpur. My experiences there during my MTech had convinced me that I wouldn’t find a better research environment anywhere else to pursue a PhD.",
      "How was your PhD journey?",
      "My five years as a PhD student at IIT Kanpur were some of the best years of my life. I got the opportunity to interact and learn not just from renowned scholars but also from outstanding peers. The frequent interactions with my supervisor, Professor P.R.K. Rao enriched my day. In addition to profound scientific advice, he also inspired me to learn things outside my research area. Although my journey was relatively smooth, doing a PhD in the pre-internet era posed some significant challenges for all of us.",
      "How was your experience publishing papers at that time?",
      "Publishing papers in high-impact international journals was difficult. Telephones and letters were the only modes of communication. In addition, there was an obvious bias at the time as India wasn’t recognized at the international level for cutting-edge research. Fortunately, things have changed for the better in the last fifteen years. The IITs and other institutes have now started emphasizing research and technology development while increasing the intake of post-graduate and PhD students. We now have an ecosystem where students can nurture their scientific acumen and produce good quality work, capable of competing at the global level.",
      "How do you balance your research and administrative work?",
      "I spent the initial days at IIT Bombay delivering good quality content and making an impact in my courses. I guess that motivated some exceptional students to join my group. I worked closely with them in the laboratories and in classes to implement my research ideas. Sadly, the interactions got affected over the years, as I started to dabble with administrative roles. I became a part of government committees and regulatory bodies and actively took part in policy-making. I believe it is essential for researchers to be a part of policymaking in line with the current technological trends to create possible roadmaps for future research. They might find them uninteresting due to a lack of deep technical content. However, it is imperative for the country’s development because their participation can make a huge difference. Now, as a Director of IIT Kanpur, I can only dedicate weekends to my students. I have been fortunate to have students who took the initiative and didn’t require much assistance. All they usually needed was a slight nudge and encouragement. My students are one of the reasons why I have been able to balance my research, academic and administrative responsibilities. However, the ongoing pandemic has brought in considerable challenges to researchers, faculty and administrators alike.",
      "What motivated you to work on the Frugal 5G challenge?",
      "After my PhD, when I eventually joined IIT Bombay as a faculty member, I wanted to focus on developing technologies indigenously and making India technologically self-reliant. The motivation to do so traces back to my early research days, where I had observed that some of the challenges we faced were unique to our country. And when I was in the process of building my research group, I met some incredible academicians who shared my vision. Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala was one of them. His mission was to develop beneficial indigenous technologies and make them accessible to the country’s larger population. Similarly, in my entire research career spanning about thirty years, my focal point has been developing indigenous technology and making the country technologically superior. For the last twenty years, my research group has extensively focused on system building and making technological interventions like broadband and wireless systems accessible to a larger population. The concept of ‘Frugal 5G’, i.e., delivering affordable wireless broadband to rural areas, is one of the outcomes of our research endeavor.",
      "How has the pandemic affected you as a Supervisor and a Director?",
      "As an administrator, taking a call that would please everyone is generally a difficult task. The current crisis has made it even more challenging to make some tough decisions. We always carefully weigh the ‘pros and cons’ and keep the larger interest of the institute in mind. But still, it was a hard time when we had to send the students back to their homes considering their best interest. It is not always possible to make decisions we ‘like’ in an administrative position. Not everyone may like the decision and not every decision turns out to be correct, especially when a judgment call needs to be taken quickly, like during a pandemic. But we have to keep moving forward. A good administrator corrects their mistakes whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself.Like everyone else, research in my group has been affected too. Unlike those who work on theoretical problems, some of my students who work extensively on experimental testbeds for 5G needed access to hardware and a laboratory and were greatly impacted by the lockdown. Nonetheless, despite such technical difficulties, I am fortunate to say that all my students have received full financial assistance even after their stipulated five to six years.",
      "How important do you think are academic and industrial collaborations?",
      "I have always been a cheerleader of industry-academia collaborations and have collaborated with industries and government since the beginning. While the funding from government agencies has gone towards setting up the laboratories and other infrastructure, the industry projects are funding the manpower. Industrial collaborations can make researchers aware of real-life problems, thereby paving the path for translational research. A significant amount of understanding is required for realizing prototypes and developing user-friendly products and although in our country, some industries do not have an in-house R&D ecosystem and are looking at basic engineering solutions, the scenario is changing in many places. Such facilities are gradually being set up and I think it is an equal responsibility of academicians to collaborate with these industries and improve their research.",
      "What is your opinion about the current entrepreneurial ecosystem in India?",
      "We have been working in the direction of making our country self-reliant and globally competitive by developing cutting-edge state-of-the-art technology. The IITs and IISc were originally set up to be the hubs for technological and entrepreneurial advancements. While the initial 30-35 years of the IITs were mostly spent on teaching and mentoring engineers, the focus has shifted to research and entrepreneurial pursuits in the last 15-20 years. PhD students are now highly encouraged to work on translational research and allow their ideas to become prototypes, products, and finally go commercial. It has even inspired NITs and other colleges to take this route and build such ecosystems for research and entrepreneurship. With a population of 1.3 billion, there is no dearth of talent in our country. In fact, it can be seen as the engine that drives the country to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem rooted in high-end technology and become self-reliant in the true sense.",
      "Do you think India should have its own research journals?",
      "Initially, when the Telecom Standards Development Society, India (TSDSI) was formed along with Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, and several other colleagues, we asked ourselves, “should we be adopting India-specific standards to further our work?”. I think if we do so, we aren’t taking advantage of economies of scale operating globally. Our objective should be to develop intellectual property, patents, and influence global standards, ensuring impact at both national and global levels.Though I strongly believe in making India self-sufficient in technological advancements, I don’t however think we are at a similar level to start our own journals addressing these indigenous research work. The readership is an essential factor; without an active engagement, we cannot sustain write-only journals. We need more researchers and more academics and strive to improve the quantity and quality of research so that a wide range of people can read and understand the work done here.",
      "How important is it to publicize your research on social media?",
      "At this moment, social media and science communication play a prominent role in engaging the general public in research. In my opinion, it is not just enough to do high quality research but also to communicate it to the public. People, in general, might not understand everything you do, but conveying your research on social media serves to get feedback from the layman. Sometimes such feedback triggers ideas on how to improve your research or direct it to help society in a better way. Science communication also prevents research from being confined to a small community.",
      "What makes one a good PhD student and a good supervisor?",
      "As PhD students, you should keep in mind that you aren’t in an endgame and shouldn’t get disheartened if you don’t get favorable results or your papers are rejected. PhD is just the beginning and you have an entire life to develop your skills and make progress. The guidance from a supervisor plays a vital role in these scenarios. The supervisors should help and encourage students to do high end research that gets global recognition and ensure more of their research gets published in international journals. As a final piece of advice, I would like to point out that every individual has strengths and weaknesses; recognize those and harness your strengths instead of focusing on eliminating your weaknesses."

I knew that being in Computer Science meant that there would be fervent competition in academics, but that did not stop me from participating in any of the activities. I remember being part of every committee one could think of, and I was the one present everywhere money matters were to be handled. I was trusted to handle the money, and I was good with people. Eventually, every purchase for the sports committee, the cultural committee and the presidential committee went through my purview. I was part of the Hockey team as well, and even though I never became a Senator, I am sure that I had attended more Senate meetings than any of the elected Senators. All in all, I had a great time during my undergraduate days at IITK.",

      "Q. What were the key factors that motivated you to pursue a career in academia?",
      "",
      "",
      "→ Well, it’s difficult to say. Towards the end of my B.Tech, I was very sure that I didn’t want to get into academia, and after my third year, I had the impression that I’d complete my MBA next and then have my startup, and back then, startups weren’t the technology-based ones, they were the ones which meant setting up your own shops and businesses. And I just knew I wanted to be my boss. And now that I think of it, I had all the wrong ideas about pursuing an MBA. I had decided in my head that my next destination was IIM Ahmedabad and that post my MBA, I’d have my shop, but one day, my very dear batchmates, after coming to know of my plans, asked me if I was an idiot?! And they convinced me that someone as bright as me shouldn’t settle back in India but should pursue a second degree in the US. While I had dismissed the idea because I knew I couldn’t afford the entire financial burden it’d entail because I couldn’t even have borne the fees to appear for GRE and other exams. However, my friends supported me then and gave me three drafts of 110 bucks each to help me sit for the exams, and I did sit for the exams and finally applied to foreign schools and got admitted to the University of Maryland.",
      "",
      "",
      "Even after going to the US,  initial plan was to complete my MS and then come back to India, complete an MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, and open up my shop. And I was then told that if I wanted to do an MBA, why not pursue it in the US itself, and then I appeared for the GMAT. I aced the exam with a complete score of 800 without even preparing for it. I had topped the exam globally, and post this, when I started getting admission calls from Universities, my then supervisor challenged me, saying that I was only pursuing an MBA because I couldn’t do a PhD. I remember I took the challenge head-on and went on to complete a PhD as well.",

I remember applying for a position to work in the field. Still, the coordinators everywhere at IITD, IITB and IITK gave me the honest response that the project employees are mistreated, and even though I asked them that if they knew employees were mistreated, why would they continue with it, but they just told me that the system doesn’t change and that if I wanted to work on it, then I should complete my PhD and then come back and join the project.",
      "",
      "",
      "Post my PhD, I had no clue what kind of job I wanted and if I wanted to stay in the US anymore or come back to India. My supervisor told me to take four weeks and visit India to explore the job opportunities. So I remember going to IITs and applying for the role as a professor and to corporate firms as well, and the response I got was very contrasting. Every corporate firm told me that they’d only consider me for the job after I had completely shifted back to India completely, and that was understandable to an extent since many people from the US would prefer to stay there. However, all the academic institutions told me that they’d consider me whenever they’d have their next selection committee meeting. With a couple of letters of appointment in hand, I knew that I would pursue Academics. And to be honest, I am thankful that I got into academics because this is a great job, and every year, we meet so many young and enthusiastic people with so much energy.",

      "→ I think the image of IITs has improved drastically in the last few decades. When I got selected for IIT, My father wasn’t certain if joining the institute was worth it because the fees here were more than double what it was at Delhi College of Engineering. And I remember having to convince my father that IIT was the better place. Back then, people did not realise the difference between the IITs and other colleges, and many people with ranks in the thousands would choose Delhi College of Engineering over IITs. Today, students with not so good ranks would prefer IITs over any other colleges, and the reputation of IITs has increased severalfold.",

      "",
      "",
      "→ There was a discussion during the shift from the AIEEE system that there was a need to evaluate students on things other than Physics, Chemistry and Math. Therefore, it was thought that the two stages of the exams would mean that the initial exam was an aptitude test, whatever that entailed and then the second exam to test the Science and Math subjects. It was discussed that the colleges could use a combination of scores in the two tests to define their criteria for admissions. However, there was a lot of opposition from the IIT Council to having an exam that would be common to admission to IITs and non-IITs. Now, the first exam serves as a prerequisite to the second exam, and the first exam is the one that is responsible for ranking students going into the non-IITs. Hence, this exam too had to have Physics, Chemistry and Math and not just aptitude. One couldn’t have had rankings solely based on Aptitude and English scores, and hence, the entire idea of the Aptitude tests was scrapped.",

      "I think we should have more exams for admissions, in fact, multiple exams. The whole idea of having just one exam or as few exams as possible is a braindead idea. We should have multiple exams and multiple parameters to define admission criteria instead of just one single exam. The AIEEE to JEE shift hasn’t changed many things, and it hasn’t made any difference to the kind of students we get, but I think we could have used the opportunity to have more talented people join the IITs.",

      "Q. How was your experience as the Dean of Academic Affairs at IITK?",
      "",
      "",
      "→ The work of DOAA is purely an administrative job, and the work is to implement the academic decisions taken. I, in general, would not have enjoyed the job, as I wanted to have some influence on the academics. Later, I realised that I definitely had some influence in the decision making, in the sense that, in the Deans’ meeting, one can say things and ask the Senate to consider it. In the name of the implementation, you can always sneak in a few things, for example, at the time of pre-registration, you will be given the timetable for the exams so that a student can choose their courses properly if the endsems of two courses are clashing even though the schedule is not. So, these kinds of things can be done. I thought of it as essential and failed to implement the students’ feedback for the faculty. Whenever we take a survey, it is expected that the survey results will be shared with the people who filled it, to whomsoever I talked, they said that if someone asks for this information, then under RTI, we will have to share it and that is the problem. The RTI act also states that if you think that some information is sharable, you can share it before someone asks for it, on your website or any other place. It was clear that this information will be of interest to many others and thus should be shared, and I did share it one semester, and we had to take it down within 48 hours as there was so much opposition. Otherwise, I was pleased with this position and had a remarkable tenure.",

      "Q. It is common knowledge now that the number of students entering IITs is increasing. Is it true that the quality of students graduating from IITs has deteriorated over the years? If so, what are the possible reasons?",
      "",
      "",
      "→ I don’t think the quality of graduating students has gone down. What has changed is the mindset of the children. For instance, the percentage of students in our times who would take up a course solely because it is interesting was far higher than it is now. Students will think about which course should be taken to get a better job, a better CPI. And the whole focus on the placement is problematic, and that is in direct line with the coaching culture. When you have lived 2-3 years of life with such a narrow goal, it becomes hard to live if you don’t have a specific aim after achieving that goal. Thus, the first-year students need to set up a goal very fast, but they hardly know anything, their potential, their interests and then they set up the goal as “let me get a job at the end of these four years”. So, they start questioning if a particular course would help me get a job in this company or that place. These students can change the world, and if they have a goal of getting a job, that creates problems.",

      "",
      "",
      "→ In general, I think the new IITs are trying to replicate the old IITs, IIT Gandhinagar being slightly different. However, most of the new IITs have the old IITs as their mentor, and thus they want to become the same. Maybe they have more flexibility for the students and as such, but if you compare in the last 15-20 years, the freedom has depleted a lot.",

      "",
      "→ In the current pandemic time, we have no option but to go online because we cannot bring many students together. I think that IIT Kanpur could have made better decisions, and decisions made were probably the most irrational ones among the IIT system. Going forward, I believe the tier-1 universities will go back to the classroom system, but the tier-2 will keep the online ongoing, maybe. Take, for instance, person X is teaching in the classroom and the same person conducting online lectures, most people will prefer in-class education. However, if you ask the normal average faculty teaching in class and the best teacher in the world teaching online, the answer is different. So, my take is that there will be a mix of online and offline education in the post-pandemic times.",

This is why we see students having fun in their first and second years and then a sudden shock in the third year of not getting internships. What matters in life is the skills and education you obtain and learn. Your skills are important. You have plenty of time to gain that knowledge, play games, have fun, and be culturally involved. So, you can plan to change the world. You don’t have to worry about getting a job. Do hard work sincerely, and you will get the results.",

      "Vedaant Sikka, President, Students’ Gymkhana, writes about the issue of campus re-opening and reaches out to the general body members to provide a clear sense of what has transpired so far and what the plan is going forward.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general.",
      "The motivation behind this is that I feel it is important for me to communicate with all of you directly considering the online mode has made it difficult for all of us to stay in touch. I would request all of you to please not cherry-pick the statements that have been made and to interpret the article in its entirety and in the right context. The article does not present any moral judgments on any of the stakeholders and is not in any way an indication of who/what is right and wrong.",
      "Firstly, we should take note of our (the students) point of view and motivations and also the institutes about campus reopening. From the Institute’s side, a good place to start would be to talk about the risk and the appetite the institute has to manage risk. Recently, the institute faced this situation where it believed that the existing facilities and infrastructure, both inside and outside the campus, was inadequate to manage the number of cases they had at hand. Hence, the decision was taken to send the students back home from campus. While the above statement is not a judgment on whether the decision to send back students was right or wrong, the institute’s alignment on this matter is to take a low-risk approach towards calling back students. Hence, they are incentivized towards calling smaller batches in the initial phases.",
      "Also, the institute is aware of the fact that online education delivery has not been very effective as compared to the offline system. Students have certainly not liked the format & more efforts are also required from the faculty side in terms of preparations, and still, the output has not been up to the mark.",
      "From our perspective, online education, which comprises not just the courses, but also the interaction with everyone on campus, access to the best academic resources and the opportunity to be part of offline festivals, clubs, societies etc, has absolutely not been able to deliver in comparison to the offline system. Students are deprived of the peer group they had on campus. It is a well-known fact that the group of students at IITK is one of the best in the country and the online model has clearly posed a major hurdle in terms of staying in touch and thus, presents a problem of value and expectation.",
      "The problem is that we(the student body) are facing the lack of experience that we were promised while admission to IITK. This problem comprises the online mode of education in comparison to the offline model, the lack of proper peer interactions & opportunities to develop into versatile personalities. Another severe major concern with the online semester(s) has been its effect on the students’ mental health. The lack of having the ability to readily reach out to our beloved friend circle and have bulla sessions has resulted in deteriorating mental health. The experience of studying at home has proven to be significantly ineffective to impart a holistic experience, to add to this, this model of education has also magnified the disparity in the resources available to students at their homes. Considering that on campus, the students had access to more or less the same set of resources, the online mode has brought forward the severe inequality in the privilege of different sections of the student body.",
      "From the institute’s side, one of the major problems they faced while calling back the students and the subsequent management during the second wave of COVID19 was that the students took rules and regulations lightly, and in adverse circumstances, there would not be anyone to take care of students on campus. While we are made to sign an undertaking, it is also important to understand that the responsibility of the institute does not end there. As the risk of a fatality is significantly high, in the circumstance that something terrible happens, the institute would have to face the wrath of the various stakeholders such as families, students as to why the students were called back.",
      "Coming to a few developments in the recent past and what is being decided on going forward, a brief timeline with the following sequence of events should help paint a clear picture.",
      "Regarding a plan to call back resource-constrained UG students and Masters students, we worked on devising mechanisms and forms to effectively call the resource-constrained students and the plans for the same have been shared with the institute now. They are currently discussing the same and will let us know about any updates.",
      "An open house was conducted by us for the PhD students recently. A call for a similar open house for the rest of the students was suggested to the institute as well. Subsequently, a message was shared to the Heads of Departments to hold open houses for students of their respective departments to gauge the issues being faced by both UG and PG students. The HoDs play a major role in the decision-making system in the institute and are aware of various plans in place regarding the matter of campus reopening, and thus, having HoDs in the chain of communication would help present the students’ side of things efficiently.",
      "Recent developments on the campus reopening issue are as follows:",
      "According to current estimates, an estimated timeline is to have all PhD students back by August third week or August end. In September, we have proposed plans to at least begin with the UG batches along with the Masters’ Batches. As the situation with the pandemic is dynamic, any updates on this timeline would be provided as and when things are clearer.",
      "Since the situation presented to all of us is unpredictable and that there is a lot of uncertainty involved, the problem of misinformation has caused a lot of issues. Social Media and conversations in social circles have had various implications on all of us and one major issue with this has been that solving the problems at hand has become inefficient and has negatively impacted the drive and motivation. In the current scenario, a lot of instances might come up of people being seen as working towards the goal of campus reopening individually or otherwise. It is important to realise that even though the intentions of these initiatives might vary, the outcome would be independent of them. If it was possible to solve problems that way, most of the issues we face right now might have already been dealt with.",
      "In my opinion, there is a lack of clarity between the parents and the institute administration. The Institute is inclined to consider even the worst-case before coming to a decision. There is a need to bridge this gap and ensure that the institute is aware of the parent’s point of view about sending students back to campus. The parents (and students) should also know the actual risk the students will face based on the facilities available on campus. This will also allow parents (and students) to decide for themselves on what is in their best interest.",
      "On a concluding note, the core idea is that the view of people who are responsible for students at home (i.e. parents) needs to be properly told to the people who are responsible for students on campus (i.e. institute). All of this, while knowing that students are not kids. They have to take on independent responsibility for themselves and be involved equally (if not more) in this process.",

      "The QS World University Rankings were released in the past week, and IIT Kanpur was ranked at 277thplace in 2022 compared to the 350thrank in the 2021 edition. Despite achieving quite significant growth in the past year, it is important to notice how the institute’s rank had fallen from 291 in 2020 to 350 in 2021. The last couple of years have been quite a roller coaster for us, and we at Vox Populi aim to analyse the recent performances of IITK with its leading sister IITs .",
      "QS, which stands for Quacquarelli Symonds, is one of the world’s leading provider of services, analytics and insight to the global higher education sector. The QS World University Rankings have grown to become the world’s most popular source of comparative data about university performance in the past decade. The parameters used to assess the performances of institutes include Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, Faculty-Student ratio, Citations per Faculty Ratio and the International Faculty and Student ratios and calculates scores out of 100 in each of them. The break-up of the weightage for each of these parameters is shown below to put things into better perspective.",
      "The QS Rankings use the Academic Reputations of institutes as the primary metric, and this criterion holds 40% of the total score. Using a combination of purchased mailing lists, applications and suggestions, the QS survey asks active academicians across the world about the top universities in their respective fields. For each academic domain, the respondents are asked to list institutions (excluding their own) which they consider excellent for research in the given area.",
      "Academic Reputation has been one criterion where IITs majorly fall behind in the rankings and have to work upon. The trends among the top 5 IITs have remained constant, IITB taking the lead, followed by IITD, IITM and then IITK and IITKGP. With a score of 30.1/100, IITK is ranked 6thin India, with Delhi University being a notable leader at 4thplace with a score of 35.3. IIT Kanpur has seen a falling trend in the Academic Reputation numbers in recent years, but the slight improvement in 2022 has brought the score to 30.1,  the score still remains far behind those of IITB and IITD.",
      "The criterion of Employer Reputation focuses on the employability of the graduating students. This criterion involves employers naming up to 10 domestic and 30 international institutions that they consider excellent for recruiting graduates. They also classify the disciplines from which they prefer to recruit. By examining the intersection of these two questions, QS judges a measure of excellence in a given domain.",
      "The IITs have enjoyed having one of the best Employer Reputation scores in the country. However, when compared to other IITs, IITK does not perform as well. While IITK jumped from a score of 35 in 2021 to 41.1 in the 2022 rankings, the scores in this domain have been relatively lower than IITB (79.6) and IITD(70.8). Thus, while IITK overtook IITKGP this year, there is still scope for improvement as our scores lag significantly compared to our sister IITs.",
      "The Faculty/Student Ratio criterion measures the quality of educational content delivered to students and a reduction in the teaching burden on the faculty members of the institution. This criterion holds 20% of the total score, and thus, it plays a pivotal role in determining the QS Ranking of any institution.",
      "IITB has consistently had a high Faculty/Student Ratio among all IITs, even though it dropped down from 36.2 in 2021 to 32.5 this year. IITK stands at the fourth spot, with a meagre score of 18.3, close to half of IITB’s score. IITK has witnessed a string of continual low scores in this domain, with the score not crossing the 20/100 mark in the last five years. While this is a parameter where the increasing number of students has made it challenging to keep up with the faculty numbers, the meagre numbers compared to IITB, IITD and IITM point to how recruitment of faculty at IITK has been relatively slower.",
      "Citations are measured by taking the total number of citations received by all papers produced by an institution across five years by all the faculty members at that institution. This means that for the 2019 score, data from 2014-2018 would be considered. All citations data is sourced usingElsevier’s Scopusdatabase, the world’s largest repository of academic journal data.",
      "After scoring exceptionally low in 2018, IITK showed increasing scores in 2019 and 2020. This was, however, followed by a sharp decline in 2021. Redeeming itself in this domain, IITK scored 81.6/100, which is the 4thbest score among IITs, which IITG leads at 94.8, IITR at 88.8 and IITKGP at 88. While there has been debate in the academic circles about whether Citations per faculty is a better metric than Citations per paper, IITK’s scores, though a little erratic, have ensured that the institute upholds its reputation of being one of India’s finest research institutes.",
      "These parameters take into account the global outlook for the institutions operating in the worldwide education sectors. In addition, each university is assessed based on its international reputation, attracting international students and faculty from around the globe. The factors contributing to this include providing both students and staff with a multinational environment, exchange of best practices and beliefs, and inculcating in them global awareness, a soft skill that is in great demand among employers. Both of these criteria contribute to 5% of the overall score.",
      "These parameters have been sore spots for Indian Institutes for an extended period. In terms of International Faculty, none of the leading IITs have been able to get a score > 2/100, which explains how Indian colleges have not had sufficient participation from International faculty members. Although with a score of 1.3/100, IITK performed better than IITD(1.2) and IITM(1.2), it was still behind IITB(1.5) and IITKGP(1.5). When it comes to International Students, the picture isn’t much different. IITK, scoring a 1.2/100 in this parameter, is only ahead of IITKGP(1.1) in comparison to leading IITs. While there is a need to admit more International Students, the highly competitive JEE examination has more or less closed the doors for international students at the undergraduate level. While more and more international students are being admitted to the Masters’ and PhD programmes, the numbers are still relatively meagre. Hopefully, with the advent of more academic programs and diverse departments, these numbers will witness an upward surge in the coming years.",
      "With the institute celebrating the jump of 73 ranks in 2022, it is important for us to also take cognizance of the fact that there is still a long way to go.  The gaps between the scores of the leading IITs and our institute have widened steadily. Steady ranks outside of the Top 250 have meant that the institute’s global image hasn’t improved much in the last half-decade and with the number of students increasing over the years, the corresponding change in the academic and non-academic infrastructure remains to be absent. It is imperative to take note of these issues and strive for capitalizing on the chances for positive change. Hopefully, the upward trend in the 2022 rankings can be replicated in the coming years, and we might witness IITK competing shoulder-to-shoulder with the leading Indian institutes in all aspects.",

      "In these dreaded times, initiatives taken by citizens personally can help someone cross the line between life and death. One such initiative termed‘Breathe India’, is being led by a team of IITK Alumni, who are striving in order to help the needy through this campaign, by collecting funds and then using them to provide oxygen concentrators to the hospitals. The hard-working alumni team leading the initiative consists of Ashutosh Ranka (Y13, BT in MSE), Isha Agarwal (Y11,BT-MT in EE), Nikhil Asati (Y13, BT in MSE), Kavya Eluru (Y12, MSc. in MTH), Randhir Shah (Y9, BT-MT in ME), Mounica Sarla (Y11, BT-MT in BSBE) and Gundeep Kaur (Y11, BT in CHE).",
      "We had the privilege of talking to Ashutosh, who answered some of the prevalent questions in one’s mind regarding the campaign.",
      "You partnered with the SaveLife Foundation last year too in an initiative to transport migrants back to their homes. Tell us about the experience and how did the campaign fair?",
      "The motive last year was quite ad-hoc and I got involved with the foundation on a rather short timeline and got to fundraising. We could collectively raise ~INR 20 Lakh which aided in arranging 20 buses to transport close to ~500 migrants back to their home states. While this number is quite minuscule on the scale of the crisis, I got cognizant of the ground realities and the constraints that could arise in a campaign like this. This year, I have a team of alumni onboard that are striving endlessly to make this campaign impactful. So to sum up last year’s initiative, I would say that it sure was impactful, but there was a lot of personal learning for me in the process too that I am applying now.",
      "The first phase of the campaign has been a great success and the team has now proceeded into the second phase of the campaign. How are the funds being utilized and what has the team achieved so far?",
      "The first phase sure has been successful. We surpassed our initial target of INR 1 Crore and managed to raise over INR 2.4 Crore within five days. My team and I wholeheartedly want to thank all contributors for their support of the campaign. Our team has placed an order for 250 Oxygen concentrators (with another 50 in the pipeline) which should be arriving in Delhi by the end of this week. The advantage of concentrators over conventional oxygen cylinders is that there is no requirement of refilling and the concentrators function on electricity. Once received, the concentrators shall be handed over to the Delhi Government and they would provide these supplies to hospitals on a need basis. The current situation is quite volatile and we are hopeful that this initiative should aid in easing out the situation eventually.",
      "Given the overwhelming response in the first phase, what is your team’s vision for the second phase?",
      "The second phase aims to aid beyond Delhi. While Delhi is still nowhere close to self-sufficient in medical equipment, we wanted to move forward and do our bit in other states’ crisis as well. We have now partnered with RightWalk Foundation, an NGO based in Lucknow that works with slum communities in eleven districts of U.P. We have so far raised about Rs 80 Lakhs for the second phase and the orders have been placed with the current funds for supplying to U.P. We have made it a point to dispense the funds on a rolling basis wherein we wait for a certain benchmark to hit and place wholesale orders upon hitting the target. This eases distribution and aids the needy as soon as possible.",
      "What can the general IITK junta learn from this initiative and how do you think they can support in these times, if not financially?",
      "These are pressing times and I feel that every citizen of this country has a duty to perform. While staying at home should be continued as it has been, there is a lot that people can do with the resources they have. The financially independent people, the alumni are encouraged to support various fundraising campaigns that seek to bring immediate medical support to patients across the country. One of the alumni of our institute returned to his hometown, Jhansi, during covid and helped set up a helpline that provided real-time updates to the number of beds and oxygen cylinders in the city. Current students can take inspiration from such initiatives and help in their own way which may not necessarily be monetary. Helping set up oxygen cylinder fill-up stations, helplines, plasma donation camps in your neighbourhood could be your contribution to this mammoth revival mission.",
      "Apart from all this, we need to be there for each other in these trying times, as there is a lot of sorrow and melancholy that has been engulfing each of us individually. This too shall pass and I hope that we all triumph over the virus!",
      "Through the means of Vox Populi, we aim to spread more awareness about this initiative and seek the help of any kind, ranging from donations to expanding our reach. The first phase has already been successful and the same is hoped for the second one, and it would only be possible through the benevolence of the donors and the hard work of all of the people working behind the scenes in this campaign. We encourage our readers to support this campaign at the link provided below. Everyone can help by spreading awareness and making donations of any amount.",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the Editorial Board of Vox Populi and the writers, and theirs alone.",
      "In retrospect, Vox Populi cited aleakedpersonal e-mail in the article that was intended to be private between a student and the DoSA. It was quoted without providing the entire context.This was a grave mistake and we shall strive to ensure that such an incident never repeats.",
      "As the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic ravages the country, India reported 2,94,000+ new cases on the 20th of April. The very next day, the IIT Kanpur administration abruptly sent out an email, mandating all students residing in Halls of Residence to vacate their rooms and return home within five days of the order[1][2]. Clarifications issued later exempt those students under quarantine/isolation for suspected/confirmed Covid19 from this deadline.  In his emails asking students to vacate their rooms, the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA) cites the dismally overstressed situation of the healthcare systems, both on campus and in Kanpur city, as being the primary motivator for the decision. As of 22nd April 2021, there were 113 confirmed Covid19 cases on campus – 58 of whom were students. The administration deemed it impossible for IITK to handle a bigger outbreak of the virus. Compelling hundreds of students to return to their homes seems to be the only solution that was thought of.",
      "As it stands, while the intention behind this decision will have been to minimize loss of lives, the administration’s actions pertaining to IITK students have been highly exclusionary and disappointing, besides being downright dangerous.",
      "Interactions with and among students reveal valid concerns about returning home. Prior to the announcement of the decision, on April 20, the President Students’ Gymkhana held an online general body meeting with the PG students and stated that he had firmly requested the DoSA to avoid such a course, and only encourage students to vacate. The mail that arrived on the 21st, was thus, entirely unexpected.  (Our report on the GBM can be accessed at[3]).",
      "In response to the eviction order, a group of PG students conducted an online meeting on April 22 to discuss their concerns and chart out a better solution. The meeting had 400+ participants, with multiple faculty members in attendance. The primary concern that emerged was that travelling in these conditions would undoubtedly put students and their families at increased risks of contracting the virus, potentially creating multiple new clusters of infection. Many students had vulnerable family members with comorbidities and were unwilling to undertake such travel. In any case, the decision mandating students to return home, seemingly made without any consultation with student representatives, was thought to be at odds with the notion of students being full members of the IITK community.",
      "Students’ attempts to engage the administration over these concerns were met with no response in several cases. After the meeting on April 21, the students drafted a letter[4]delineating their concerns and requesting a more equitable and inclusive solution to the situation. With over 370 signatories (consisting mostly of students, along with some faculty members), gathered via a signature campaign, the students emailed this letter to the Director, the DoSA, the DoAA, the Ombuds group, and the Chairperson of the BoG. At the time of writing this article, the email is yet to elicit any direct response from any of the addressees.",
      "In every step of the administration’s response to the disaster,empathy– if any –appears almost as an afterthought. Following the objections from the students, the HoDs of some departments organised online meetings with the campus-resident students on April 23 and 24. Here, it was communicated that students with extraordinary circumstances precluding their travel (for example, a Covid19-positive member at home) would be exempted from the order and allowed to extend their stay on campus. The same was formally communicated via an email by the PSG only on the PG mailing list. Hence, many UG Y17s, who were also subject to the order, were not aware of this option – even though the exact same concerns applied to many of them.  Furthermore, most students who eventually requested this temporary stay extension got their approvals on April 25— almost 4 days after the initial vacation directive, and merely 1 day before the deadline. By then, many of them had already left the campus. As a consequence of this heedless policy-making, many returned to households with infected family members.",
      "Continued attempts made by students to engage the administration over the flaws in this decision-making process has been met with disguised hostility. On April 21, a PG student emailed the DoSA, criticising the decision[5]. The DoSA replied with a quote from the undertaking signed by the students prior to arrival:“I will fully comply with any measures/guidelines prescribed by the Institute in this regard”and argued that“by saying that you are against the decision, are you saying that you will not comply and thus go against the undertaking you have signed? (sic)”. The reply made no effort to address the several issues raised, instead circularly justifying the decision on the basis that students were legally bound to follow it. The DoSA then cc-ed the email to the student’s HoD and asked the HoD to“take note of the actions of the students”. Responsible dissent being met with responses that have veiled undertones of negative consequences: does this not go against the very spirit of an academic community?",
      "Furthermore, news articles claiming to quote official IITK statements demonstrate a flagrant withholding and misrepresentation of facts on part of the Institute. On April 25, the news organisations News18 and The Indian Express released articles ([6]and[7]) quoting a purported IITK press release which states that reports of students being forced to leave the campus in the middle of the pandemic“are totally incorrect”. They go on to claim that only“fit students”have been“requested to leave”. On the contrary, the emails sent to the UG and PG students ([1] and [2])  use the word“mandated”: no part of this, in any sense or measure, appears as anything less than forced. Having talked to several UG and PG members who were on campus, we understand that it is a widespread notion that students are being unwillingly compelled to return. As of writing this article, the Institute has not issued any clarifications distancing itself from these quotes.",
      "The blatant lies this statement then conveys, via obscuration of the full nature of facts, appears to be an attempt to prevent the institute’s decision from coming under scrutiny. In addition, the nature of these actions is utterly disrespectful of the attempts of students driven to desperation, to meaningfully engage with their Institution, asking for due agency and representation.",
      "Let us now address the elephant in the room.",
      "India has reported 3,52,991 COVID cases and 2,812 deaths on 25th April. An article published by the New York Times[8]claims that the reported numbers are a severe misrepresentation of the gravity of the pandemic and the true toll remains undercounted –  the actual number of deaths and cases may be two to five times the reported statistics.In an emergency live telecast, the prime minister requested all citizens of India to stay inside and avoid travel to contain the virus spread. Such is the ground reality in which students of the IIT Kanpur have been mandated to travel. Are they at a high risk of contracting and spreading Covid? Undoubtedly.",
      "In the time of a nationwide calamity, the first and foremost responsibility of the institute should have been to ensure the safety and welfare ofallthe residents living on campus. Regardless of its intent, the actions of the administration have subjected hundreds of its students to life-threatening risks. Using public transport at this point is extremely unsafe: there are many students who need to travel via multiple modes of transport, over many hours, in order to reach home. The fear of getting infected, and in turn endangering the lives of one’s own family, would be a constant on their minds. The healthcare infrastructures of almost all Indian cities are failing, and multiple UG and PG students (who shall remain anonymous) who travelled back in the last few days have already tested positive for Covid19 after reaching their homes.",
      "We understand the fear behind this decision. Many Indian colleges that reopened (e.g. MIT Karnataka) were severely affected and were declared containment zones. Amid the horrific second wave, such a situation may befall IIT Kanpur. According to the administration, the Health Centre does not have the capabilities to manage it. (detailed in our previous report[3]).",
      "But if the concerns of both the administration and the students emerge out of a common fear of exposing the IITK community to the virus, why did the former allow itself to leave students with no option, other than to undertake travel during a pandemic, without paying any heed to their opinions? While the students did sign an undertaking, the unexpected nationwide surge of the pandemic is far worse than what could be envisioned when signing to it.Does the legal validity of this signature solely justify the ethics and morality of the administration’s orders?",
      "In unprecedented times like these, it is imperative to explore diverse solutions, while engaging the entire community in an inclusive decision-making process. It is evident that the lack of regard for students’ concerns has left them helpless, heartbroken, and feeling alienated from the IITK “community”. The pandemic has and continues to affect each of us in distinctive ways. We request the administration to acknowledge the plights and the opinions of students with utmost regard in all future considerations.",

      "In light of the second wave of COVID-19 infections and spike in cases on the campus, the college administration has asked all students (UGs as well as PGs) residing in the hostels to vacate their rooms and leave the campus by 5pm, 26thApril. Only the non-graduating students can retain their rooms while graduating students are required to completely empty their rooms. The instructions, however, do not apply to those living in ‘non-hostels’ (SBRA, CPWD quarters, etc.) and those under quarantine currently. The Dean of Student Affairs, in his emails, cited the grim situation on the campus and overstressed healthcare support system in the city to have led to the decision.",
      "The Dean sent an email two days ago (20th April) asking all UG students to vacate. Currently, there are around 500 Y17s who came back to campus in March itself. The return of the final batch (out of 3) of students was suspended due to the spike of Covid cases on campus. To discuss the possibility that PG students might also be sent back, the President, Student Gymkhana and the Chairperson, Student Senate conducted an emergency General Body Meeting (GBM) for all the PG students on the same night. The email asking all PG students to vacate was sent yesterday (21st April).",
      "The Current Situation",
      "As of 22nd April, there are 113 active COVID-19 cases on campus, out of which 58 are student. Over 200 students and 150 residents are in quarantine/isolation, many of them awaiting RT-PCR test results. A mail sent by the director appeals for co-operation by campus residents, highlighting the following issues being faced by the healthcare system in IIT Kanpur right now:",
      "The director and DoSA, in their previous mails, have strongly encouraged students on campus to return home due to the issues being faced. They have also stated that many people on campus are violating the strict guidelines that have been set to avoid a dangerous situation. According to the emails sent by the Director dated 16th and 24th March, people on campus are not wearing masks properly and gathering in large groups. As the situation has grown more severe, the guidelines have also become stricter with lockdown periods, limiting office staff, closing indoor facilities and the academic area, fines for not wearing masks and prohibition of large social gatherings. Yet, there is evidence of students flouting these guidelines.",
      "The GBM began with an address by the President, Student Gymkhana. He stated the reported number of active Covid cases and acknowledged that the actual number might be a lot higher. The healthcare system of both the city and the campus is severely overloaded. Due to the spike in cases in Kanpur, the RT-PCR test conduction and results are also getting delayed.  Hence, it will be very challenging for the campus to handle a worse outbreak. Under the current conditions,  the campus is very unsafe. He stated that the student representatives had already communicated to the administration that PG students should only be encouraged and not forced to leave the campus. However, the student representatives themselves also requested and strongly encouraged students to leave, if possible. The final decision was supposed to be taken in a meeting scheduled yesterday.",
      "Following the address by the PSG, a poll was conducted in the GBM. It turned out that nearly 57% of the students wanted to stay on campus, 21% were unsure and 22% were completely willing to go back home.",
      "After this, a number of PG students voiced their opinions and concerns. The major concerns discussed were-",
      "At the end of the GBM, the PSG strongly insisted the PG students get their issues across to their guides and professors to make their voices heard. The student representatives took a firm stance and again stressed that they have already asked the administration to not force PG students to vacate the campus. They also said that if the students can leave, they should.",
      "Also, while the above concerns were discussed in the PG GBM, the last two points apply equally well to the decision of sending back hundreds of UG students. The fact that this decision will cause the spread of COVID on some level is certain, and the students travelling via public transport would need to exercise extreme caution. The institute is offering to arrange travel and RT-PCR tests required for travel, if needed. The institute will also arrange for safety equipment like face shields to ensure the safe travel of students.",
      "Many PG students are against this decision and the Gymkhana office bearers are in constant touch with the administration to reach a compromise. This is a developing situation and further details are awaited.",
      "The second wave of Covid is wreaking havoc across the country. We request all our readers to take all precautions and hope that everyone stays safe.",

      "The Inter IIT Tech Meet ended its 9thedition on Sunday evening, with IIT Kanpur emerging as the overall winners. The trophy comes back home after a long four years, and in such times that no one could have dreamt of it before. The three-day event was hosted by IIT Guwahati from 26thto 28thMarch with 11 competitions ranging from Technology to Social Entrepreneurship. 22 Contingents from the IITs attended the event, and IIT Kanpur managed to bag medals at nine events. The events were broadly classified into three categories based on the prior preparation they required: High-Prep, Mid-Prep and Low-Prep events. Teams have been toiling hard for the past month, juggling quizzes, assignments with the problem statements and adjusting to this online preparation mode. We got in touch with the major stakeholders who shared this tasteful victory and legacy of technology at our institute.",
      "In conversation with Mudit Agarwal (Outgoing GenSec)",
      "With his participation in three consecutive Techmeets, Mudit explains how IITK has grown to have students interested in diverse domains and fields. Mudit also talked about how the Inter-IIT events have brought students closer to the industry and motivated them to work on problems with direct connections with industrial bigwigs like ISRO, DRDO, and Bosch. Coming to the challenges and difficulties the contingent and the council faced because of the online paradigm, Mudit said that the online events robbed them of the “rush and thrill” of competing against other IITs. The contingent also faced a communication gap due to the lack of in-person coordination. However, he appreciated the hard work and efforts made by the contingent members. On a closing note, Mudit acknowledged that the online system had posed a lack of ‘hands-on experience’, but he believes that the SnT council has always managed to work out solutions for challenges and find a way to make the best out of the coming year.",
      "In conversation with Soumya Ranjan Dash (Contingent Leader)",
      "As the win for IITK came in after almost four long years, it made the victory all the more special, said Soumya Ranjan Dash, the contingent leader for the Inter IIT Tech Meet 9.0. He further added that though the contingent came in 3rd the last time, the team spirit and hard work displayed by every participant brought us a gold this time around. Soumya candidly praised everyone who worked on their particular problem statements as experts in their respective domains, who were well capable of handling the difficulties that emerged with time. He also lauds how the participants managed to deliberate and work together on a problem amid classes and quizzes. Conclusively, Soumya urged future members to work hard, prove their worth, and further uphold the SnT culture. He then ended his message on an inspiring note – “This gold won by the current contingent should give the incoming team an important position to defend in the coming years.”",
      "Competitions at the event:",
      "In theBosch Traffic Sign recognitioncompetition, IITK stamped its authority by being the sole IIT to clinch the Gold. Utkarsh Gupta, in a candid conversation, tells us about how the team was a bit anxious after the presentations by other IITs, but the belief and the hard work put in by the IITK team made sure that they won first place by a good margin. The team worked in ML and AI to implement a traffic sign recognition model and were able to host the same on a live website that raised the bar. Utkarsh also hopes that motivated students will look at this year’s problem statement and begin working on relevant projects with the Council in this tenure.",
      "InBridgei2i’s Automatic Headline and Sentiment Generator, Abhishek Mittal explains how the problem statement involved Natural Language Processing to identify themes of articles and tweets and the underlying sentiments. He mentions that being a high preparation event, the online paradigm caused a few problems with coordination between sub-teams working but at the same, appreciates that the team overcame these problems with diligent efforts and planning and was able to work with a proper plan. He mentions that the online event does not have the same charm as the offline event. He states that this was a positive learning experience and that the team does better next year at the InterIIT.",
      "Anshul Rai from theDrishtee Tech-LED Innovation challengeteam from IITK tells us how the problem of social entrepreneurship and sustainability was new. The team worked on a solution to reduce the weight loss of fruits and vegetables incurred during transportation and increase shelf life. He mentions that with his experience of being a part of the contingent last year, the level of competition remained the same this time around. The InterIIT event provides a platform for students to gauge themselves at a national level with students from India’s best colleges.",
      "InDRDO’s Vision-Based Obstacle Avoidance Dronecompetition, Rohan Baijal from the team talked about how the team faced challenges in the technical domain of autonomous exploration and the lack of available resources research. He appreciates that the team took out time and kept the momentum going right from the start. Rohan also said that the standard of problems is being stepped up every year and that this year was a good experience for the team but hopes that by next year, the team is more experienced in the field and raises the bar for the years to come.",
      "IITK clinched the silver medal inISRO’s Web-Based Visualisation Tool for Astrosat Observationcompetition. Som Tambe from the team explains that they used ReactJS and Django to implement the front-end and back-end. He mentions that the pandemic posed logistical as well as communication difficulties for the team. Still, the motivation of working for an ISRO project and representing IITK pushed them to give their best. He mentions that they aim to win comprehensively next time and that interested students should reach out to the relevant seniors and start working on stuff that piques their interest.",
      "InRutag-NE Agrobot Challenge, the IITK team achieved the silver medal, and Jaagrati Jain from the team explains that the team worked on design an effective robot to help terrace farming techniques for different kinds of seeds using Ploughing, Transplantation and Weed removal modules and made the bot smaller and cheaper to make it more affordable. She also said that the online paradigm caused a problem due to the clash of classes and quizzes for the team members and applauded the team’s dedication and hard work, helping them clinch second place in the competition.",
      "In theBosch Electric Vehicle Simulation competition, Saksham Gupta from the team talks about how fulfilling an experience was for the section. They explored and learnt many things from scratch and secured the Bronze medal for IITK. He says that Inter-IIT was a lowkey affair in the online scheme of things. The lack of in-person coordination was undoubtedly felt, but he appreciated everyone’s enthusiasm and zeal which helped IITK win.",
      "TheSaptang Lab’s Network Security Hackathonwas an event in which IITK clinched Gold. In a conversation with Ketan Chaturvedi from the team, he explains how five worked on five different problems based on exploiting bugs in pre-existing software. He mentioned that even though they won the Gold this year, they aim to be the sole IIT to win the gold in the next edition of the TechMeet and become the security hackathon leaders at the InterIIT level.",
      "In a conversation with Rishi Sagar from this year’sProduct Folks case studyteam from IITK, he explained that the problem statement was about a company called ‘Kaching’ and its strategy to bring back ‘word of mouth marketing. The team worked on creating an automated method of implementing the solution and made the most out of the time they had at hand. Despite the lack of in-person interaction, the time found positive collaboration and less fatigue in the coordination for their work. Next year, the team looks forward to grooming interested and enthusiastic students for the case study competition.",
      "TheJaguar Land Rover Damping energy harvestingchallenge this year was a new and different kind of problem statement than usual. Soumik Ghosh from the team explained that they came up with two solutions using electromagnetic dampers and thermo-electric couplers but couldn’t win due to some loopholes in the final solution. He suggests that more experience and participation in competitions would help the IITK contingent better face such problems. That motivated and interested students should reach out to seniors for advice and opportunities!",
      "With theQuantInsti Algorithm Trading Challengethis year, Rishabh Batra explained how the problem statement revolved around creating an algorithm for paper-trading in the US markets for five days. The team back-tested their strategy for the solution and worked to create the best possible solution. Rishabh also explained how the platform used for the challenge was relatively new with little documentation, and some connectivity and trade problems came forward as hindrances. He hopes that the IITK contingent gets better next year and aims for the top spot!",
      "In conversation with Utkarsh Gupta (Incoming GenSec)",
      "Recently elected SnT Council GenSec, Utkarsh Gupta, was all praises for the contingent and applauded the efforts made by every member. He mentioned how the lack of in-person collaboration and the bulla sessions made the delegation feel a bit undermotivated about the competition, but as time progressed, the excellence that IITK stands for instilled immense enthusiasm among the delegation resulted in the final feat. On what the Techmeet means to the SnT culture of IITK, Utkarsh aspires to make sure that IITK completes the hat-trick to keep the trophy permanently at home. On learnings from this years’ tech meet, Utkarsh said the council plans to explore new domains better to equip the contingent for diverse problem statements next year. In his final remarks, Utkarsh appreciated everyone who has been a part of the contingent and said, “The team’s unparalleled perception and approach to the problem statements is what SnT at IITK stands for”",
      "After a great stint at this year’s Inter-IIT, Vox Populi congratulates the contingent and other stakeholders and hopes that we can up the bar year on year from here on!",

      "On 22nd January, the first shot of the Covid vaccine was delivered to the health workers of our Institute. Of course, we all got excited and decided to bring to you what’s been happening under the hood and how this came to be. We had a talk with the Head of HC, Dr. Mamta Vyas, to find out all about this great news. Here’s everything we got to know.",
      "So, the government has planned to carry out the vaccination drive in multiple phases. The first phase includes immunizing all the health care workers who are at the greatest risk. Phase 2 includes all the other frontline workers such as police personnel, army personnel, and sanitation workers. After that, we have phase 3 that includes the people over 50 years old and all the other people with comorbidity(multiple diseases) such as those suffering from hypertension and diabetes.",
      "We, the HC and IITK administration have been very proactive to get this done smoothly. HC had prepared the list of health workers to be vaccinated and got almost all of them vaccinated. Of the 92 workers on that list, 90 have been vaccinated, and only 2 are left, both of whom have certain medical issues. HC workers will receive the second dose of vaccines on 19th February which will complete their immunization.",
      "Initially, HC was not one of the designated vaccination centres designated by the government. But considering the number of health care workers involved, we asked the COVID Vaccination Officer of Kanpur to carry out the vaccination drive in HC itself. Upon our insistence, the CMO of Kanpur, DM of Kanpur, and the COVIDVaccination Team of the district declared HC as a COVIDVaccination Centre. Finally, on 22nd January, our Director, the DM, and the CMO of Kanpur inaugurated this drive.",
      "The government has provided guidelines to be followed at any vaccinating centre, like having a waiting area with social distancing norms, a vaccination chamber, an observation area, and an AEFI (Adverse effect following immunization) room. AEFI room is like an emergency room ready to deal with cases of potential side effects after vaccination. All of these guidelines were followed at HC. Chairs were put up in the pharmacy lounge, and that area was used as the observation zone. The emergency room (room #7) was used as the AEFI room. The Vaccination team authorized by the government was present throughout the process which consisted of 14 people and a few police personnel. People from this team alone were allowed to carry out the vaccination and they were very efficient in their roles.",
      "Two vaccines are currently authorized by the government – Covaxin, and Covishield. HC workers were vaccinated with Covishield. The government provided the vaccine and we did not really have a choice among the two. Two doses of the vaccine are required to complete the immunization, with the second dose being 28 days after the first one. After 14-28 days of the second dose, antibodies develop in the body. Even after being vaccinated, people should continue exercising caution and use masks, wash hands frequently, and follow social distancing norms.",
      "At HC, the vaccinated people were given a rest for  30 mins during which they were kept under observation by the AEFI and vaccinating teams. Fortunately, no one suffered from any significant side effects. OPD services were closed for that day while emergency services remained active. Few of us faced some mild body aches, mild fever, and some pain at the injection spot, after several hours. All the health workers were back to their normal duties the very next day.",
      "For the second and third phases, we are requesting the authorities to let HC be a vaccination center to help vaccinate the campus residents.",
      "Vaccination for everyone is yet to be announced. Anyone should be able to get themselves vaccinated in the later phases. Once vaccination for everyone is announced, the institute will plan it through HC.",
      "We strongly urge people to keep faith in our scientists and the vaccines being made. We also request every health worker out there to come forward and get vaccinated. I, myself have received my first shot along with my co-workers and would urge people to come forward for vaccination on their turn. We are happy that we did not face any issue in getting our health workers vaccinated, unlike other centres, where several medical workers were hesitant and some even had to be chased down to get vaccinated! Our 90 health workers were vaccinated only in about two and a half hours with no such complications.",
      "We believe that the entire community must look forward to vaccination so that we can get back to normalcy as soon as possible. The Health Centre has been functioning continuously throughout the pandemic despite all the odds. As a doctor, it’s a real struggle to treat patients, with all these restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Quite a few of our employees did get infected by COVID, which caused considerable anxiety and fear initially, but they duly recovered and got back to their duties. Becoming immunized has given us a lot of confidence going forward and would help the community in quickly getting back to normalcy.",

      "None of us had expected 2020 to pan out the way it did. While the institute was busy ensuring that our academics must not suffer and that students should safely return to campus, it was alongside working to keep up with our education system’s changing patterns. Our institute realises that modern-day problems require solutions which are hard to reach using traditional methods. With NEP just introduced last year, IITK was already planning to develop various departments with the rationale of not just promoting streamlined, advanced and collaborative research, but also facilitating targeted educational problems.",
      "We have compiled the new key developments happening in our institute for everyone’s benefit, let us take a look!",
      "IIT Kanpur has offered programs in Cognitive Sciences for quite some time now with a PhD program, MS by Research program at the Masters level and minors for undergraduates with a plethora of courses from various disciplines to choose from.  In 2019, a Cognitive Science experts team visited the campus as a part of the National Advisory Committee and recommended the department’s formation.",
      "The institute will be the first among the IITs to have a full-fledged department of Cognitive Sciences and will be headed by Professor Narayanan Srinivasan. Professor Narayanan brings 15+ years of experience in this field and is currently involved in the transition from the Interdisciplinary Program (IDP) to the department status. He says the current way forward for the department would be hiring of more faculty strength and development of robust research infrastructure at the institute for the conduction of experiments and extensive research. The department will slowly progress through these milestones and then introduce rigorous programs at the Undergraduate level. In the short run, the team plans expansion and introduction of more fundamental courses in Cognitive sciences for students to explore and take an interest in this relatively newer field of study in India. New course offerings are planned for as soon as the fall semester, but no new program offering is planned this year.",
      "The department aims to train cognitive scientists from various aspects: computational, psychological, philosophical to name a few and provide a congenial environment for the study of the complexity of the human mind, apply it to real-world problems and build the future of technology. The students will be prepared for careers in artificial intelligence, business, data analysis, government intelligence, healthcare, human performance, information processing, law, marketing, product design, and software design.",
      "For focused education, research, and indigenous technology development programmes related to India’s energy sustainability, primarily targeting clean, renewable, and alternative energy sources, IIT Kanpur has established a new academic department of Sustainable Energy Engineering. The Department’s academic and research programmes will nurture well-rounded energy engineers through an interdisciplinary curriculum providing a multiple skill set. The department graduates are expected to ably serve the growing industrial and R&D sector in energy sustainability. Aimed towards initiating distinctive sector specific academic graduate and undergraduate programmes, faculty members of various backgrounds will design the curriculum with relevant courses from core engineering disciplines blended with science and humanities.",
      "This initiative comes at an opportune time when the Indian government has committed to source 40 per cent of its installed power generation capacity from renewable sources by 2030, as pledged in the Paris Agreement. While various faculty members at IITK have been engaged in research related to sustainable energy technology development, a dedicated department will help these efforts come together and fertilize collaborative research to undertake bigger challenges. The new Department’s important aim is to translate its R&D outcomes into systems and prototypes to open technology commercialisation avenues.",
      "Prof Ashish Garg, appointed as the first head of the new department, said: “The current research focus of the new department will be on energy generation via solar, wind and other clean sources; energy storage, e.g. hydrogen storage, batteries and supercapacitors, electric vehicles, energy distribution, smart grids, carbon capture, clean alternative fuels, waste-to-energy, clean water and energy policy and economics. The research portfolio will further expand into new areas as the Department grows.” He added “having a department will further strengthen coordinated and impactful research and development, leading to the better national and international visibility of IITK in this field and resource generation.” Our institute has already partnered with Rice University, USA, for setting up a collaborative research centre as part of the new department in energy sustainability and other such collaborations are expected in the future.",
      "In the words of Prof Manindra Agarwal: “This is something we have been discussing for a long time. In India, there aren’t enough exporters in cybersecurity, and because of that reason, as well as increasing digitalization of the country, we’ve already reached a situation where the Cyber vulnerability is not getting addressed. We felt the need to train more human resources in cybersecurity, which led to this programme’s conceptualisation.",
      "We expect to make a significant impact at the national level because the target is not limited to training a small set of people through this master’s programme. At present, we plan to start with a small set of students; even though we’d increase it subsequently, the number would remain small. But in parallel, we’re also working on starting an e-Master’s programme in cybersecurity, through which we’ll be able to reach out to a much larger body of professionals. We’re also running a programme which will be a certification programme in cybersecurity, and also intend to start an undergraduate training programme in cybersecurity from probably next year. We are expecting to train thousands of people every year in cybersecurity through all these programmes put together. And that hopefully would make a significant impact on the national level.”",
      "Recently the department received substantial funding from the Department of Science and Technology to create a technology innovation hub in cybersecurity at IITK. This funding is of INR 170 crore spread over 5 years. Before that, they had already received funding of around INR 50 crores from various agencies in cybersecurity. Putting all these together sums up to a tremendous amount of money, some of which has already been invested and a lot of it is going to be invested at IITK for cybersecurity. This programme is being designed by Prof Manindra Agarwal and Prof. Sandeep Shukla, and they’ll be primarily responsible for running it as well. Of course, they are expecting that many more faculty will join in as they go along. To begin with, though, it’s just the two of them.",
      "Under the Department of Civil engineering, a diploma programme in geodesy, the science of measuring the Earth has been launched, which will focus on three core areas — geodesy, navigation and mapping, remote sensing, and GIS.",
      "Prof Abhay Karandikar, Director, IIT Kanpur said: “Geodesy is an area where well-qualified technical human resources, research activities, and geodetic infrastructure are required at the national level for the fast-developing infrastructure requirements in the country today. The National Center for Geodesy (NCG) has been established to enhance expertise in Geodesy and allied areas.”",
      "Dr Radhakrishnan, Chairman Board of Governors, IIT Kanpur said: “The D-IIT(Diploma of IIT) programs launched at IIT Kanpur will raise the national capability in Geodesy and Navigation & Mapping besides impelling advanced data analytics into Remote Sensing and GIS.”",
      "The Geodesy has applications in monitoring earthquake, volcanic, landslide, and weather hazard recognition and response, soil health, water resources, and drought surveillance, climate change including monitoring the polar ice cover, oil spill clean-ups, GPS timing and autonomous vehicle development.",
      "The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) approved the establishment of a Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) facility at IIT Kanpur along with IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and Bose Institute. The centre will boast state of the art facilities for researchers to carry out a high-level study in structural biology, enzymology, ligand/drug discovery, and be a stakeholder at the national level in combating new and emerging diseases and other biological challenges. Sandeep Verma, Secretary at SERB, noted that Cryo-EM is a powerful tool that will assist researchers in visualizing high-resolution protein structures in various environments and researchers should be able to address high-level biology problems using this facility. He also has mentioned that the facility will be made available to other institutions and use and adequate workshops and programs would be conducted to train a requisite number of specialized human resources in the field of Cryo-EM and 3D Image reconstruction.",
      "Through the launch of these programs and departments, IITK extends its attention to primitive fields of study in India and aims to be the pioneer in innovation and change for the betterment of society. With the announcement of the New Education Policy 2020, IITK realizes its duty as an institute of academic excellence to promote the coordination of various disciplines of study and to bring about holistic development in individuals that are part of it. As the world progresses and innovates rapidly, complexity increases and specialized fields like cybersecurity, cognitive sciences and sustainable energy become more and more essential, and IITK commits to imparting education and preparing more capable individuals who can make a mark for themselves and create impact.",

      "Distant is the day we got a mail announcing that our Holi break is extended for 12 days. Many of us were delighted, and there was news that some hailed corona as a savior, chanting slogans like “Jai corona, jai corona!”",
      "No one’s doing that now.",
      "This virus took our exciting, productive, and fun-filled campus lives and turned it into a boring, bland slog of a semester. We should’ve been out there, learning and developing our lives. Handling another such semester without our friends, wingies, and MT ke chai-pakode would not be very pleasant, will it?",
      "Let’s have a look at what’s happening in our college and around the world. We’ve done some digging and a lot of speculation to get a hint of what the future holds for us. We’ve looked into how different universities around the world are coping up and adjusting their curriculums to find a place for the real experience.",
      "Conversation with the DoAA",
      "Our conversation with our Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor Achla M Raina revealed that going online was not a matter of choice for the administration; it was the only recourse the Institute had, given the COVID-19 outbreak.",
      "Having a normal semester was never a viable option because of the risks involved. Hence, we had to turn to the online mode of instruction. On the subject of assessment, a model to have an offline mid-term and end-term assessment was considered at one stage. However, since calling students from all over India for exams was again a huge gamble, outsourcing the exam was also considered. Technically a mode of exams where we could choose to give exams to a center close to our homes could also have been viable, just like it happens for JEE. In this case, however, students living in poorly connected areas would have had to travel a lot for the exams and the logistics of doing it for each of the over 500 courses would have been a nightmare.",
      "Eventually, it was decided to have a continuous assessment scheme, so that each assessment holds comparatively less weightage and assesses a relatively smaller portion of the syllabus. This would also discourage students who were not keeping up with the Honor Code.",
      "Another significant factor that went into this decision is the need for closure of a semester. Keeping the assessment hanging in uncertain times as these only makes things even more uncertain. This was one of the reasons the Re-examination for 2019-20-II Semester was chosen to be conducted in the middle of this semester itself, even though it had its drawbacks.",
      "Around 40 faculty members were working to get the course materials delivered in pen drives to students who had serious problems with internet connectivity. These companions of ours are at a major disadvantage and it’s great our college is doing what it can, for them.",
      "We need to recognize that we don’t have any good choices left. All the good choices have been laid to rest by the evolving global health crisis and we are presented with a scant amount of sub-optimal solutions. And we have to, regrettably choose one of these.",
      "The Students’ Take",
      "The current semester went by quite quickly due to its condensed nature but was way more challenging for most than an offline semester.",
      "Through the initial weeks of the semester, many such out-of-the-box policies (read: experiments) passed, and many failed too, which burdened the further course of many students’ academic load. Problems faced by professors were resolved as the semester progressed. Some professors have even come up with innovative ideas for teaching and assessment.",
      "The new batch, Y20, has joined in online mode. It is the same for them as it was in JEE days, sitting at home and studying. Till now, it’s been challenging for the Y20 batch, since they have to adjust to new ways of teaching and assessments without the help that comes with the presence of friends.",
      "We all remember the orientation period with the initial nervousness and adrenaline rush, right? For them, the orientation was attending webinars for two straight days.",
      "Conversation with a Residing Student",
      "In a recent conversation with a Ph. D student currently on campus, he informed us that about 900 students opted to return when first asked by the administration. Further, the departments were asked to give a preference list for arrival, as the students would be returning in batches. This list was loosely based on seniority. On arrival, there were some checks at the institute gate, and the students had to fill a form declaring they will take necessary precautions. Regulations are being followed by the campus community and regular temperature checks are being held.",
      "According to him, professors are very eager for the students to return to labs, although classes are to be delivered online only. The Ph.D. curriculum has been tweaked to accommodate WFH, especially the literature bit. Overall, the students back on campus seemed to be satisfied with the institute’s efforts.",
      "In our conversation with Vedaant Sikka, the present Convener of CoSHA (Council of Students’ Hostel Affairs) gave us insights as to how PG students have been residing on the campus. Students were called in batch sizes of around 250 and were quarantined for 14 days. Each wing had only a few rooms occupied which ensured social distancing. Food was delivered to each room by mess workers wearing a protective kit.",
      "Coming to the campus was completely voluntary and the decision for which students to call and in what order, was handed to the departments who’d know it best.",
      "For PGs doing experimental work, there was no way to do that from home. As for UGs, they can study online, however unrewarding or frustrating it may be. So it does make sense to start calling PGs first.",
      "As for the prospects of UGs returning to campus, they look bleak, unfortunately. The academic calendar for next semester does not specify directly that the exams will be online though. The institute is keeping options open for now.",
      "Challenges with calling students back",
      "Our conversation with Nikunj Kothari, President of Students’ Gymkhana revealed the main issues that came up in the discussion of calling back students.",
      "Initially, testing was not possible, so the only way to call any student was that we had to quarantine people and wait for the symptoms. This also limits the number of students we could call in a single batch since quarantine space is limited. This is what we had to do when we started calling PG students.",
      "Another problem is that our college, and Kanpur as a city, are not very well equipped to deal with covid cases. There are around 3 hospitals in the entire city that are equipped to deal with COVID cases since things can get out of hand pretty quickly. Even the few people on campus who had COVID had difficulty finding a bed in these hospitals.",
      "Also, the institute needs to be meticulous and careful regarding the wellbeing of its students. If it doesn’t seem feasible to safely call back students, the institute will have to continue in the online mode. IITM had an outbreak and they had trouble getting it under control with such great medical infrastructure. In Kanpur, it’ll be way more problematic.",
      "Logistically as well, the college isn’t equipped to handle so many students with social distancing in place.",
      "So things do look bleak for the time being. Let’s look at a few ideas and potential solutions to some of the problems.",
      "Any Solutions?",
      "With the above problems in place, implementing a robust and systematic plan to bring students back is hard. Universities around the world have tried to execute this and have failed miserably sometimes, while some have carried out the process with certain poise. Some things that can be learned from their mistakes and from their plans are here:",
      "So you see, nothing very new. But we wish it were feasible to implement. The honest truth about reopening the campus is that while the situation can be made safer or riskier, but there is always going to be a fuzzy demarcating line between the two.",
      "Julia Marcus, an infectious disease expert recently explained in an interview:",
      "“Any plan that requires a radical change in behaviours and perfect compliance is doomed to fail.”",
      "Who’d have thought we would be gone for 10 months as we left this place for our homes back in March. But here we are, sitting in our homes, sometimes working, sometimes not, with the only social interaction being with our families and via call or text to our friends. No bicycle hitchhiking to classes, no friends to wake us up and drag us to classes, no wing hangouts, and no late-night campus walks. Our rooms gather dust, and so do we. We were supposed to still explore the campus and the people there, work in the clubs, and live out the fests again. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. But asLemony Snicketwrote,",
      "“Fate is like a strange, unpopular restaurant filled with odd little waiters who bring you things you never asked for and don’t always like.”",
      "And so here we are, trying to make something with this time handed to us. Trying to stay in touch with our friends (not to mention our classes!). Wishing that the real campus experience starts sometime soon, and now we’ll appreciate it much more. That is, of course, if we are lucky to have it.",

      "For the first time in IIT Kanpur, Online Elections among the General Body were conducted for the formation of the Executive Committee of Hall 6. The elections, where the votes were cast on a web-based platform, were conducted by the Election Commission, Students Gymkhana. Here, Vox Populi presents a report on this process and the views of the various stakeholders on the conduction.",
      "This happens to be the first time when an online medium is to be used for polling among the general body – which though was in discussion in the Senate way back since 2017-18. The Students Senate had recommended conducting elections in an online mode way back due to them being more accessible and comfortable to the general body. Yash Maheshwari, Chairperson, Students Senate, in this regard remarks,",
      "“As the offline elections were working just fine and online elections were uncharted territory, even though recommended, the transition never happened. Now as the lockdown due to COVID-19 has forced us to shift everything online, it’s time that we start having online elections as well.”",
      "A Subcommittee was formed for the same in 2018-19, which recommended that online voting should be welcomed and that the halls should adopt the same to test and improvise the process for campus-wide implementation in the future. Vedaant Sikka, the current Convener of the Council of Students Hostel Affairs, when asked about the instigation of these elections, stated:",
      "‘The idea behind online hall elections was to ensure that the periodicity of tenures is maintained, and there is a proper scope of guidance and transfer of knowledge and experience from the previous HEC to the new teams. Thereby, considering the availability of all the necessary logistics, we decided to go with Hall 6 as the first hall to have online elections. This was announced in the first regular CoSHA Meeting on October 3, 2020, and was planned to be followed as per the Model Hall Constitution.’",
      "As an alternative to online voting, a process of nomination was followed for the Hall Administrative Body selection in Hall 2. Sahil Khan, ex-President – Hall 2, had his concerns regarding having elections. He felt that the current elections are involving Y19 students – who may not have even visited their parent hall, let alone handle it’s governance given their lack of exposure. He added, “We adopted a different structure for the Hall committee(HAB) 2 years back, which involves both 2nd and 3rd year students. Given this, the Y18 we nominated were proven executives who had previous exposure to Hall administration for an entire year. These people know the inside-out of Hall administration. Moreover, we’ve nominated only 3 people to continue the minimal functioning required from home and will proceed to election’s once the situation is more clear.”",
      "When asked why she didn’t explore the option of forming the HEC through nominations, Priya Tholia, the outgoing President of Hall 6 felt that nominations are an undemocratic procedure involving only 10 ex-HEC members. She remarked, “Those HEC members would have their personal biases, and even if not, it would not be very hard to influence them.”",
      "The election procedure began with the appointment of Chief Election Officer for Hall-6. Nominations for the same were invited in September, following which the previous HEC organized a ‘Know Your HEC’ session. The nominations were called for ten posts with a deadline for submission of manifestos two days later. Along with this, the Code of Conduct was imposed. The candidates could campaign through posters, short videos, messaging, and meetings on any video calling platform. On the last day of campaigning, a SOAP box was organized, which lasted for nearly nine hours. Elections were held on the scheduled date, 1st November, through an online portal, developed as an academic project, and maintained by the Programming Club, IIT Kanpur. The polling was conducted smoothly with results being declared almost immediately. Though the turnout was about 220, which was lesser than 295 votes last year, considering the absence of a first-year batch, who are generally considered the most active ones in the HEC elections, this number seems satisfactory.",
      "Though the logistics were well-arranged, a lot of concerns were raised on the efficacy of online elections. The major issue which surfaced was regarding the participation of people with limited to no internet connectivity. Thus, the elections were not thought to uphold the notion of democracy or provide fair chances to everyone to vote or contest, given the unfavorable conditions. The less time given for campaigning was also questioned upon, amidst the hectic ongoing online semester. Also, the genuineness and transparency of the process remained suspicious to many and there were doubts on possible misconduct or malpractices. In our discussion with Prince Kumar, (Chief Election Officer, Students Gymkhana), we were told the system was already used during the Senate meeting held in August, and the result was flawless, with a unique verification code used for registering considering just the one-day usage. We were further notified, “Other than that, for the first time, we implemented a system which sent an automatic mail whenever someone cast a vote, which verifies their vote; and all others who haven’t voted would receive a mail at the end of the voting period notifying them of the same. So in my opinion, we took care of all the issues.”",
      "However, the GBMs told that they didn’t receive a verification mail after voting. There were even residents who mentioned that they did not receive a single email and were unaware of this process until they got the voting access.",
      "To address the common doubts raised, the Election Commission floated a set of FAQs in return to these queries, stating various possible solutions. The election for the posts, where people were willing to file the candidature but were incapable currently, was postponed to future dates. A centralized repository carrying the entire election content was maintained and provided to the hall residents. As mentioned, the sizes of the uploaded files and recorded audios and videos were kept minimum, to make them accessible to all. The candidates were also affirmed to be given access to extra internet if required. The virtual campaigning process was claimed to be less time consuming and the entireties were seen as compensating the repetitive campaigning visits made in any regular campus election. Also, a tried and tested software was deployed in voting, which was asserted to be reasonably reliable and genuine.",
      "Despite all this, in general, the candidates felt restricted due to online mediums and the absence of face-to-face campaigning where GBMs could freely pose questions and concerns. Infeasibility of conducting meetings on online video calling platforms due to the hectic online semester added to their worries. They had to reach out to everyone individually or through social media posts, which was challenging. They felt that at some places, Election Commission failed to cover the gap developed due to this pandemic. Though they found the online conduction to be less tedious and faster, the alternative of the door to door campaigning was felt highly absent in the current arrangement.",
      "Despite the issues with campaigning, the candidates expected a higher voting percentage. Lastly, the candidates opined on working for the posts entirely online. They believed this scenario’s advantage is frequent HEC meetings in the online mode. Though, the possibilities of doing groundwork and establishing connections with the hall administration and workers are significantly non-existent.",
      "To gauge the success and reach of online campaigning and elections, we also reached out to the GBMs for their opinions.",
      "“To be honest, I don’t see the point of having elections if the hall isn’t open, and only Ph.D. students are on campus.” – A General Body Member",
      "Some found elections for posts of mess, canteen and gardening secretary to be unnecessary right now.",
      "Some members were a little uncomfortable with receiving personal texts from candidates on WhatsApp. They also felt the manifestos hadn’t been altered according to the needs of an online semester. A senior GBM expressed her concern regarding the lack of experience of Y19s on campus. She suggested, ” Allow only students on the campus to run for elections and vote for it because it is ultimately them who are getting affected by the decisions of the council at this point.” There was also an emphasis on UGs and PGs’ unequal representation for the posts, which was attributed to PGs’ lack of awareness as they’re still settling down on campus.",
      "Though there was optimism too regarding online elections and appreciation for the efforts put in by the EC in making the process reliable and fair, the ‘Online Election’ process still has a long way to go to be perfect. Henceforth, in the online election proceedings and with the prospect of resorting to this process for upcoming elections as well, a proposal for addressing all its pertinent aspects under one group was put forth in the Senate and the Sub-Committee is formed to examine various processes and ensure that the process is improved for General Elections 2021.",

      "To understand the grievances and complaints of NCC cadets with the current NCC management and initiate a dialogue on the same, Vox Populi conducted a survey of students enrolled in NCC this year and received 175 responses.While most students raised grave concerns about class timings, insensitivity of the colonel, unproductive classes and condition of uniforms, others found these complaints absurd and unfair to raise. Here are our detailed findings-",
      "",
      "According to the official schedule of classes approved by DoSA and SPEC, the time of the NCC classes must be 0840-1140 hours (3 hours).",
      "However, two major problems exist-",
      "1. NCC office plans classes generally from 0820 to 1140 hours (3 hrs 20 mins), as specified in emails sent by NCC office. On certain days, the class timings are even beyond that. For example, according to an NCC email, the class on 8th February was planned from 0810 to 1210 hours, which is asubstantial-60 minutes morethan the approved NCC time(i.e. 0840-1140 hours- 3 hrs).",
      "2. NCC classes get delayed, even beyond the already increased time mentioned in the email sent out.",
      "When we asked NCC cadets if the classes end on time,only 4%of the 175 respondents said that the classes‘always end on time.’An overwhelming 57.1% respondents think that the classes ‘always get delayed’ and 31.4% respondents think that the classes ‘often get delayed.’",
      "[infogram id=”1867f141-a2ee-46f6-9e74-1b20e902866e” prefix=”Nve” format=”interactive” title=”NCC Timings”]",
      "Apart from the extended lectures/drill time, a major chunk of the delay can be attributed to a long time spent in taking attendance.",
      "We asked NCC students to choose, which of the following is closest to the time spent in taking attendance: >60, 60, 45, 30, 15 and <15 minutes. An alarming95.4 percent cadets think that NCC spends 30 minutes or more in taking attendance.",
      "This extremely alarming waste of NCC cadets’ time can be reasoned to ‘poor crowd control,’practice of taking attendance twicefor each class andpen-and-paper attendance mode, instead of the institute-wide standard of biometric attendance.",
      "[infogram id=”807098e0-f631-4ad2-b742-9c1870fb83eb” prefix=”6gE” format=”interactive” title=”NCC Attendance”]",
      "Hence,planning classes for more than the time approved,extending classes beyond the time plannedandspending unreasonably high amounts of time in conducting attendanceare the key time-related problems students face with NCC.",
      "A number of incidents we received have highlighted insensitivity and lack of empathy from the NCC colonel towards issues faced by the cadets. Some of the incidents that our respondents mentioned were-",
      "1. In an NCC activity, the cadets were asked to come on stage and speak on a particular topic for about 2 minutes in English. A student, who wasn’t fluent in English was forced to speak. When he tried to speak in English, the colonel asked, ‘What was your score in CBSE English Exam in 12th Standard?’ The student replied that he got 86 marks. The colonel reportedly said, ‘Ye hai CBSE ke checking ka level!’",
      "2. A number of our respondents said that when they asked the colonel for an exemption from physical activities due to medical conditions/injuries, backed by HC prescription as proof, not only were they denied such exemptions, but also were treated hurtfully with remarks like ‘get lost’ and ‘I don’t care.’ In a shocking incident during the class of 1st February, the colonel unwilling to listen, and allegedly threw away a cadet’s HC booklet in front of the entire class. The student reportedly felt insulted and scared after the incident. In another case, a student, who had an appointment with an opthamologist in HC, requested the colonel to allow him to leave about 15 minutes earlier. The colonel denied permission, leaving the student with no option but to defer his eye checkup as the opthamologist is only available on Saturday mornings, when the student has NCC classes and he cannot afford another holiday.",
      "3. At least 8 of our respondents told us about incidences where they were marked as absent because they came to the class in civil clothes, since their uniform was damaged or unavailable in their size. In one of the cases, the student talked to the NCC staff about his uniform before the class started, and the staff empathising with his problem, allowed him to attend the class. However, after about an hour when the colonel came to the class, he asked the student to leave the class for not wearing a uniform. The student told the colonel that his staff had allowed him. The colonel was unwilling to listen to the student, said that he doesn’t care what the staff says and asked him to leave.",
      "4. While the colonel is not bound to allow exemptions in any of the above cases, these allegedlyrepeated instances of mocking and ridiculing students might be concerning.",
      "[infogram id=”94ffb864-d771-4fab-9454-958337d0e4a5″ prefix=”LFf” format=”interactive” title=”Attitude of Colonel”]",
      "While over half of our respondents (54.9%) find the behaviour of the NCC colonel too harsh and unjustified, a significant share (almost a quarter) of our respondents think that the NCC colonel isstrict and polite but not harsh. Another 18.9% respondents think that while the behaviour of the NCC colonel is harsh, it is justified.",
      "According to one of the respondents, “I found that everyone of us (including me) is indisciplined and openly defies orders. The colonel is right to inculcate the attitude of an army man to dress and groom ourselves properly and learn how to obey and bring objection to orders.”",
      "A lot of respondents raisedthe issue of the uniformsissued by NCC, which apparently are torn/damaged and seem to be very old. When we asked our respondents to rate the condition of their NCC uniform out of 5, we received anaverage rating of 2.019 on 5.While some students faced problems like unavailability of the uniform in their size, some respondents found the issue of uniform ‘absurd’ and said that ‘if someone has a problem, they can buy a new one from the market as is done in NCC elsewhere.’",
      "",
      "[infogram id=”2bcd416a-b098-442e-92d2-aeb0c0dfaecb” prefix=”E3Z” format=”interactive” title=”Uniform”]",
      "A large number of our respondents felt that the NCC lectures arehighly unproductive. When asked to rate the productivity of the lectures on a scale of 1-5 (1 being highly unproductive, and 5 being highly productive), 41.7% of the respondents gave it a rating of 1, while another 23.4% chose 2. Only 11.5% of people thought that the lectures were somewhat productive, thereby expressing the sentiment that the lectures were largely unproductive and students hardly learnt anything.However, some of our respondents appreciated the Leadership Lecture series and found them ‘motivating.’",
      "[infogram id=”75755f73-375e-4eaa-a348-ddce0e7bf8cf” prefix=”VRr” format=”interactive” title=”Productivity”]",
      "A respondent pointed out that the IIT Kanpur chapter of NCC does not fit in with the objective behind the PE course, as it neither leads to any sort of personality development, nor is it any form of physical exercise.Another issue with NCC has been lack of proper email communication. A lot of students haven’t been receiving emails about class timings and hence, often miss their classes. When lack of information about class was presented by some students as their justification for being absent, the colonel said that it isn’t NCC’s responsibility to send email as a notice had been put and email sent were only for convenience, while notice is the primary means of communication.",
      "NCC at other IITs",
      "Vox reached out to a couple of our sister IITs to get the perspective of cadets at their respective NCC camps. A few important points were put forward in the feedback, A cadet from NCC at IIT Delhi stated that “Taking up NCC is a totally optional and only about 40 out of 1200 student take up NCC” he also mentioned how the uniforms of the cadets were tailored to their sizes and were provided by the NCC Office. Another point that was clearly stated was that all the time during the NCC hours were spent training as cadets. A cadet from IIT Bombay also provided feedback stating how the cadets were provided lectures on relevant cadet training and that the NCC hours were spent in a manner that involved cadet training as well as sports training. A discipline perk that was followed was that every cadet that arrived late was made to push ups.",
      "NCC at our sister IITs somehow paints a significantly different picture from the NCC CPA at IITK. Even though the NCC Offices at different institutes might operate independently but a lot of improvisations could be implemented to provide a better and wholesome NCC experience for the cadets at IITK.",
      "Suggestions",
      "The NCC office did not reply to our email asking for their response to the above mentioned complaints. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions we received from our respondents for NCC, IIT Kanpur-",
      "1. Respecting Students’ Time– The time table of the classes must be followed strictly, in line with that approved by the SPEC. Unacceptably large amounts of time wasted in the process of taking attendance, may be reduced with the help of biometric attendance and more efficient management. Also, currently, cadets are taken to NCC office (from lecture halls/PE ground) just to conduct attendance. This wastes a lot of time in transit which may be saved.",
      "2. Change/Improvement in NCC Leadership– NCC IITK Chapter requires a leadership which listens to students’ issues, takes in feedback and is more empathetic about it.",
      "3. Channel to Raise Complaints-A channel must be provided (through DoSA/SPEC/NCC) to raise complaints anonymously, given the absurd incidences of inhumane and unacceptable behaviour of the colonel. Currently, while the students are highly dissatisfied, there is hardly anything they can do about it as they are scared that the colonel would fail them if they speak against him.",
      "4. No student must be forced to take NCC involuntarily, due to lack of seats in other CPA. In the words of one of our respondents, “most of the students are literally pushed to do something, do not choose it and hence come to the classes unwillingly. Therefore it is being taken for granted.”",
      "5. Providing better/newer uniforms– Torn pants/shirts, pants with missing zips and shirts with missing buttons must be replaced/repaired.",
      "6. Physical and Mental Well-Being of cadets– A number of instances were highlighted where the cadets were subject to humiliation in front of their fellow cadets and were made to feel embarrassed. Despite the nature of strictness to be followed in NCC, the cadets must be treated with respect and not be humiliated publicly.",
      "7. Meaningful NCC sessions– The lectures/activities conducted during the NCC sessions should be planned and meaningful. As one of our respondents mentioned, “NCC should stop selling a career in the armed forces.” The SPEC could monitor what is being done in NCC class and ask for a class by class plan.",
      "8. Clarity about Attendance Criteria– Several students complained of lack of proper information regarding attendance criteria in the CPA. It was suggested that a clear cut attendance policy be issued to every cadet before every semester to make sure that there each student has clarity on the policy.",
      "9. Joining NCC and forging of signatures in the declaration form– At the time of joining NCC, all cadets are to give a written declaration stating that the NCC bears no responsibility in case of an injury/death in the NCC drills. This declaration also requires the signature of the parents of the cadets. As the cadets come from various parts of the country, it is not feasible for them to visit their parents in the middle of a semester. As a recourse, it is actively suggested by the NCC regiment to forge signatures on the declaration form. A good way could be to ask this permission in the orientation itself, along with other documents.",

      "To contribute to the country’s fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic, our institute, IIT Kanpur has had a significant role in  Commercializing three ground-breaking innovative healthcare solutions within three months, with the help of some of the startups incubated here. Here in this article, we would be covering the products and the people behind it all.",
      "————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-",
      "The Ventilator",
      "Learning from the western countries, many entrepreneurs in India had already started preparing equipment like Ventilators and PPE Kits for the times when the hospitals would be facing severe crises in different parts of our country. One of the leaders in this race of innovation were the co-founders of Nocca Robotics – a start-up established in 2017 by two of IIT Kanpur’s alumni: Mr. Nikhil Kurele and Mr. Harshit Rathore. They took up the challenge and came up with an affordable full-fledged, ICU-grade ventilator which is now being supplied to various hospitals throughout the country.",
      "This ventilator system is indigenously developed by Nocca Robotics and IIT Kanpur under the supervision of Prof. Bandyopadhyay after discussions with doctors and medical professionals. Initially, Nocca was in the process of building a pressure-controlled ventilator, aimed only to cater the needs of COVID-19 patients but during the process, several other guidelines, laid out by the government, were taken into account and what they ended up with is anICU-grade ventilator approved by the Technical Evaluation Committee constituted by Government of India",
      "",
      "One of the key features  of the said ventilator is its ability to reduce the risk of the spread of coronavirus through the patient. When a COVID-19 patient exhales or coughs, the air is loaded with droplets containing the virus, which is extremely infectious. This ventilator has UV chambers which kill the virus and reduce the viral load of the exhaled air. The ventilator can run on ambient air, eliminating the requirement of medical air supply line. Another notable feature of the ventilator is it’s portability, so it can be used in locations other than the hospital to handle the patients. It is much more energy-economic than the regular ventilators, so it can work on battery for at least 4 hours.",
      "Being a medical equipment of vital significance, quality testing, and maintaining high standards were of utmost importance, so all the testing has been done and passed. By the end of July, production of about 5,000 units is expected and if the demand intensifies, it could be ramped up to 15,000 units by mid-August. India’s leading missile and ammunition manufacturer PSUBharat Dynamics Limitedis manufacturing the ventilator, while Indian medical device maker Avi Health Care is also on board to assist during the manufacturing process. In the May edition of‘Mann ki Baat’, the PM praised Nocca Robotics and IIT Kanpurfor this initiative.",
      "SaniWalk, a contactless full-body Disinfectant Chamber",
      "Considering that the infection is spreading like wildfire, preventing the spread is as necessary as the cure, perhaps more. Nevertheless, the hard closure of the economy has cost many people terribly, so it becomes the need of the hour to re-open the markets and public places. But this raises the question: how can we flatten the curve? To deal with this problem, Cupro HealthTech, headed by Dr. Madhu Vasepalli, has devised a solution:SaniWalk, a contactless full-body sanitization system.",
      "Cupro HealthTech, a Hyderabad based company incubated at the Startup Innovation and Incubation Centre, IIT Kanpur came into existence in the early days of this COVID crisis. They started out as a team of 3 people only, but have now grown to about 15 members, with 5 interns from IIT Kanpur itself. According to Dr. Vasepalli, the concept was quite vague initially, but with the able and ample support of IIT-Kanpur, especially Ms. Aditi Kumar and Prof. Bandyopadhyay, they could materialise the design. Later, Prof. Sarvanan Matheshwaran helped in fine-tuning the system.",
      "Talking with Dr Vasepalli, he told us that, “A disinfection chamber works regardless of the fact that the incoming person might not be a suspected case. So we thought of developing a process which would be far more efficient in utilizing the resources. The most common symptom is fever. So we developed an AI-powered contactless temperature detecting system. If the person is detected with fever, the door for the spray chamber would not open, and he would not be allowed to go into the public, if this is installed in public places.” They have installed a facial recognition camera which would help in maintaining all the records in a central server for multiple entries of an individual.",
      "",
      "",
      "On 16th of June,the Government of India through their official twitter handle, commended Dr. Vasepalli and his team over this innovation.Currently, the first of its kind, this chamber has been successfully installed in AIG Hospital, Hyderabad.",
      "SWASA N95 Masks Manufacturing Facility",
      "The N95 masks which got fame due to increasing pollution in North India were also one of the affordable gear for protection against COVID-19 infection. Since the emergence of the COVID crisis, E-Spin Nanotech, another IITK startup has produced about 70 lakh ‘SWASA’ N95 and N99 masks, which are being used across the nation.",
      "Headed by Dr. Sandip Patil, E-Spin was formed back in 2010 under the aegis of SIIC, IITK. In the last decade, it has evolved into a full-fledged company, which is specialised in making nano-fiber and allied products.",
      "Recently, their focus has shifted towards antibacterial and anti-viral nanofibers. Dr. Sandip told us:",
      "“We are already working on nanofiber-based antimicrobial membranes. These can be used in the pharmaceutical industry, in our homes for household sanitization, A/C for air purification, and also in automobiles. These would be washable and reusable, so you don’t have to throw them away after the use.”",
      "",
      "This is a first-of-its-kind initiative by any IIT or a Technology Business Incubator of an academic institution of India.",
      "Dr. Nikhil Agarwal, the CEO of FIRST, IIT Kanpur, who has been ensuring that products and innovations like these are quickly commercialized, said-",
      "“We are pretty sure to fulfill the demands of the people. Earlier, N-95 masks were imported in India due to insufficient local production, so it cost us about Rs. 300 per mask but thanks to this setup, we are able to cut short its price to just about Rs. 50 and also have a similar quality like the imported ones. Due to the steep rise in the number of COVID-19 patients, the consumption of masks dramatically increased. In the campus itself, masks are being used by healthcare workers, staff members, and the general public.”",
      "On June 18th, the Director of our institute inaugurated the ‘SWASA’ mask manufacturing facility in the IITK campus. Talking about this development, he said,",
      "“The completely automated facility can produce 25,000 masks daily. The idea behind this initiative is to contribute to the country’s collective effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.This is just one of many efforts by IIT Kanpur to develop innovative solutions to tackle the ever-quick spread of the virus, and devising a cure for it. Ever since the virus tapped into our nation, it has been wreaking havoc on every sphere of humankind. In India, the disease has had a major effect on the unorganised sector and the people involved, with many of them losing their jobs. It has clearly given a huge blow to our economy, but one of the biggest issues that the disease has highlighted is definitely the inadequacy of resources in the healthcare sector.",
      "Here at IIT Kanpur, the efforts to develop innovative and affordable solutions were started right around mid-March. Ever since, professors, researchers, entrepreneurs and students have been working hard to come up with solutions, which are not only highly functional, but also cost-effective.”",
      "Prof. Bandyopadhyay, the Professor-In-Charge of SIIC, has not only been involved in these innovations, but has also been overseeing the various projects and their development. Talking about these innovations, he said –",
      "“As promised, a highly sophisticated, human safe, intelligent disinfection tunnel developed bySIIC incubated company Cupro Health Tech has been commercialized. The first unit was installed at AIG Hospital, Hyderabad. Moreover, the Nocca Robotics team, have made sales demonstrations for its low cost ventilators in two hospitals by respective state government orders, as of now. Mass manufacturing at one location has started. The same at 2 more locations will start within the next 2 weeks. The alacrity with which my colleagues responded to make all this happen fills me with pride.”",

    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",
    "authors": [],

      "The pandemic is slowly climbing the exponential curve and the future seems highly uncertain, but the institute administration has been sending out continuous emails to students, with guidelines and directives against COVID-19. Check out our conversation with the Director himself, as he enumerates the current state of preparations and how anxiety and impatience can be detrimental to it, along with possible solutions and what lies ahead.",
      "Given the scare of COVID-19, what steps have been taken by the institute and what is their predicted effectiveness?",
      "Firstly, all the steps that we have taken have been taken by consultation with the district epidemiologist and doctors at the Institute’s health center. When the first few cases were reported in India, we were advised to identify and screen all the people who had a recent travel history abroad, including students and faculty. We took the required measures and identified about 50 such people, and some samples were taken and sent for a test.",
      "When the virus started spreading, we decided to extend the vacation and we advised all the students who were at their home to not come back until further notice. The students who had not gone home or who had already come back were appropriately screened. We also quarantined the students, faculty, and staff who had an international travel history. It was predicted that in the coming weeks, we will enter into the third and fourth stages of community transmission of the virus. If that happens, it would become really difficult for us to control it because there are a large number of students in hostels.",
      "Taking all this into view, we decided to vacate the hostels because as of now, students can still travel safely back to their homes, but if we are any later, it would become really hard to even travel back home because of the community transmission. We have also spoken to Northern Railways and that is why we have set up a helpline for students who might face problems in ticket booking. We have asked the DOSA to collect a list of all such students. We will give a list of the students and their destinations to Kanpur Railway Station and manage the reservations. Students who cannot travel due to medical reasons can approach the DOSA and such cases would be dealt with individually. Students who have financial issues will also be helped.In all these cases, we have taken decisions keeping in view how the disease is progressing in the country, what are its expected rate of progression in the future and the advice we got from the professionals.",
      "",
      "When we start again, we will have a large influx of students from across the nation and also various workers on the campus, and handling them would be a challenge. And even by then, we won’t be sure about the complete eradication of the virus. So, what is the current state of preparedness of the institute for that?",
      "So the current date of restarting is 31stMarch, but considering the situation, the break would probably get extended for a couple more weeks. But whatever date is decided, we will give students a time of a week beforehand, so that we don’t see a sudden incoming of a large number of students. We will also have a screening facility and will try to screen every person who comes back. We have had discussions about this with the doctors at the health center. The arrangements would probably be made at the entrance of each hostel. We might give special considerations to unwell students. We had called a senate meeting and set up a subcommittee which is making a contingent plan to cover up all the lost classes. Many options are being discussed, like shortening the end-semester exams to 2 hours or to resort to a combination of online courses and extra classes. The committee will suggest the options, and we will take the steps accordingly to reduce the inconvenience to both the students and the faculty.",
      "Is there any chance that the semester would get extended? A lot of students have their summer internships around this time, who might face some loss if that happens.",
      "See it is very uncertain to say anything now. But we will try our best to minimize any loss to the students. And talking about internships, we have a special internship program with New York University for which they had already selected the students. But they wrote back to us yesterday that they would have to cancel the internships this time.  So even if everything becomes normal by May, they have already canceled the internships. Since we are living in such uncertain times, it is not possible to predict whether the students selected for internships would even be able to do them. Our focus would be to compress the semester, as far as possible. But if the situation worsens, we can’t say anything.",
      "There have been numerous incidents where people have disobeyed the instructions given by authorities, like people trying to enter the campus after the advisory or people refusing to leave the campus. What measures have been taken in this regard?",
      "I would actually want to appeal to the students through Vox Populi to adhere to the instructions given by the authorities. All these decisions are being made after long consultations and meetings, with the intention to help the students. We might have made a judgmental error, but the intention is only to help the students. Everyone, including the faculty and staff, should respect the decisions. The decision to quarantine people who have had an international travel history was not only for students but also for the faculty. By large, everyone has complied with the decisions but some instances of either students or faculty members or staff members not adhering to the instructions have been brought to the notice of either the Dean of Student Affairs or the Dean of Faculty Affairs. I would just want everyone to cooperate. It is in the best interest of everyone. We always have to be prepared for the worst.",
      "With the state government announcing financial support to daily wage workers, is the institute also working on the same lines for the mess and sanitation workers who are out of work because of the crisis?",
      "Many faculty members are willing to contribute, so we are thinking of creating an account under the DORA office. We will be sending out an appeal to students, faculty members, and staff to contribute. Whatever amount is collected, the institute from its internal resources would triple it. And then that will be given as a subsistence allowance to the workers. They might not get back their salary exactly but we will do our best to give them the most we can.*",
      "“Prevent but don’t panic”- This is an important message in these difficult times. Do you have any message for the campus community or advice for the students who are at their homes?",
      "We have been continuously telling the campus community that they don’t have to panic, just follow the proper hygiene practices. This applies to everyone, even students at their homes. You don’t have to roam around wearing a mask, just proper hygiene practices would be sufficient. We also want the campus residents to comply with all the instructions which are issued by the doctors and institute authorities from time to time. In such times of emergency, if we don’t go by the rules, it will only create chaos. We are here to help everyone; you just have to follow the instructions.",
      "Credits: Aditya Trivedi, Akshay Bajaj (Externally), Dravya Marwah",
      "*Also, there are several daily wage workers in Mess, Gym, Swimming pool, etc. (roughly 1000 to 1100 in number with a typical monthly wage of a worker ranging from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 18,000) who will lose their wages because of the lock-down, at a time when they will need the money the most with COVID-19 pandemic staring at the face of all of us.  In view of this temporary loss of work, it is proposed to collect donations from faculty, staff, and students which can be disbursed as anad hochonorarium directly to their bank accounts that can partially take care of their families in such difficult times. Please contribute."

      "As a part of Policy Conclave 2020, Students’ Opinion Society organised a talk on “From engineering to bureaucracy” by Mr Mayur Dixit, an IITK Y4 alumnus, who graduated with rank 1 as a Mechanical engineer and thereafter joined IIM Bangalore. He cleared UPSC CSE 2012 with AIR 11 and is currently the Chief Development Officer at Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand. Vox got an opportunity to interact with him and discuss his journey over a quick QnA session.",
      "What made you choose bureaucracy over engineering or management as your career option?",
      "This was my personal choice. Despite having a slight inclination towards civil services, I wasn’t completely sure back then if that was truly meant for me. Managerial and monitoring work interested me which motivated me for choosing MBA instead of starting to work after graduation or going ahead in my domain of engineering. However, after working in the industry for 3 years, the monotonicity and profit driven nature of work along with the experiences and motivation I received from some friends and college seniors working in the public sector, inspired me to pursue my long-held dream finally. The diverse nature of any public service job personally excites me. Additionally, interest in working and living in my own country over settling abroad was also a contributing factor. I had come to this realisation that a person doesn’t require large amount of deals in life. All they need is everything in only moderate amount. Of all the many more reasons, these were perhaps the major ones to make me choose this path.",
      "What does your schedule look like?",
      "Some things are planned but most things are unplanned. I get to the office by around 9.30 or 10 am. Uniqueness of my job is that I have the freedom to plan my day further. I decide my own work and plan its appropriate distribution and operation. If there’s some minister or VIP coming in, then duties usually differ. But otherwise, we have routine meetings, discussions, inspections or reviews along with monitoring work. We would need to go into the field to review the work progress and check if the planning done is actually getting implemented. We also meet with different stakeholders, political executives, beneficiaries or scheme planners to discuss their implementation process. Under some law and order situation, or natural disaster, work is nonstop regardless of day or time. It’s a hard press job during such situations of emergency.",
      "What has been your hardest posting or your biggest challenge in your line of duty?",
      "During my first posting, the biggest challenge I faced was a law and order breakdown. I was the SDM (Sub-divisional Magistrate) in Roorkee and the city witnessed communal riots during that time. Maintaining peace and managing them was very challenging since I was also very new to the service. We had to impose a 10-15 days curfew and administrating the process was a testing task. Thankfully with the support of seniors, we were able to manage it through. From that incident, I realised that different sections or parts of government need to function together or else the system can’t run as needed. Winning the confidence of local people and maintaining good relations with opinionated leaders of conflicting societies also helps in such times of crisis as they can be of benefit in times of emergency like such. Rather than talking to a crowd which has no identity, it’s better to talk with their delegates or people possessing certain influence over their communities.",
      "Since you have been from sought after colleges, how did you balance your study with personal life and other work?",
      "It’s not unusual to study in such colleges. I don’t classify myself as any extraordinary. All you need to do is work hard and show commitment towards your goal. Never have a slightest doubt on your potential. Even if you suffer failure, rethink your strategy and not your personality. Be convinced that whatever you have decided is in your best interest. And once if you decide you want to write the UPSC exam then there’s no looking back. Commitment is fundamental. Having a job while preparing was profitable for me as I learned in a different way rather than mugging and reading so many books. I strictly adhered to the syllabus by concentrating only on reading about the relevant topics, daily newspaper and following my very own notes for revision. Scarcity of time led to a smart preparation. Since I worked in finance industry, that particular topic was much easy for me to write about in the exam, as I was updated with the latest economics, finance terms and operations I handled during my job. Other topics were very interesting for me because they were very different from my routine work profile. For me the preparation was joyful and relaxing. Needless to say, that one will have to make certain sacrifices also to maintain a constant routine of studying and keep focus on their target.",
      "What kept you motivated through the challenging preparation phase?",
      "I enjoyed working in the private sector, but after a certain point the work had got monotonous. My domain was financial modelling for a certain number of companies, and so was of my senior with slight variation for just a larger set of companies. I did not wish to be at their position after 5 years or so which led me to thinking about my future career prospects. I wanted to switch to something that could provide me diversity, experience various fields and civil services fits much well to that category. In it, after having a decent amount of experience in various departments, one gets to choose their specialisation and work in its scheme structuring/policy making or even study further in that particular discipline. The work is all directed towards nation building and private sector work is more oriented towards profit making. Although private sector is very essential for growth of country as government cannot provide jobs to everyone, for me personally, I’m not interested in working where only profit is the backend reason for doing the task.",
      "Any inspiration from within the family or any acquaintance of yours?",
      "My father used to motivate me to at least consider civil services as a possible option, but I mostly neglected it. But finally, when I had the realisation myself, I felt that he was right all throughout. My wife also has been my constant support system, because she’s the one who manages our home as the work timings can be often very abrupt. I need to keep myself healthy also through this as it’s essential to manage personal life along. I don’t consume sugar in any form whatsoever, do not smoke or drink alcohol. Although my work structure doesn’t usually permit me, I try exercising regularly.",
      "Has there been an incidence where you faced certain pressure by ministers?",
      "Never. No pressure. I don’t even know of anyone of being in such a situation. These events are extremely unlikely. They are also elected government officials and know what they’re doing. And if I know I’m honest, aware of what my duties and rights are, then I can never land in any such scenario. If someone is asking me to do something which I know is not right, I just need to tell politely that such and such is not possible due to whatever reason as per law. There’s nothing they can do about it. Arrogance should never be reflected in your demeanour as your dealings are often with officials much senior to you in the hierarchy. A polite refusal is never taken in wrong direction.",
      "Any word of advice to those who aspire to become civil servants and a message for the students of IITK?",
      "Set your goal firm if you really want to be a civil servant. If your personality is so that you want to help people and be their voice, and wish to contribute in nation building, then work hard with great dedication. There’s nothing that can hold you back if you have a firm resolve. No matter what hardships you face, if you keep on moving forward, they will all eventually vanish.",
      "IITK would always have a special place in my heart. It’s my alma mater. I achieved so much from this place. It is one of the best institutions in India. I feel I wasn’t able to utilize all the facilities which was a lack on my behalf, but I would give this suggestion to all students that utilize your time on campus well. This time shall never return.",

      "National Aerosol Facility:Besides the sixth avenue, around the New Core Labs, the National Aerosol facility center is being extended from the ground plus three floors to seven floors. Currently, the fourth floor of the center has the Technopark, which is an independent non-profit company supported by the institute. The upbuilding four stories are to be taken up by Technopark itself. The work has just started, and its completion shouldn’t take more than just a year, ideally.",
      "",
      "Computer Centre (CC):",
      "Under the first phase of the National Supercomputing Mission(NSM), an advanced supercomputer delivering 1.6 petaflops is being installed at the computer center. In human terms, 50 million people would all have to make a calculation at the same time, every second, for an entire year, to match what it can do in just one second. ‘The estimated cost of its set up is around 40 crores for the machines, with an additional 5 crore expense on infrastructure.’ informed Mr. Brajesh Pandey, Principal Computer Engineer.",
      "Core Labs Extension:",
      "Between the TA101 lab and the DoAA canteen, aka the neutral ground, yes, you guessed it right, even more labs are being constructed! The framework is targeting a basement and 3 stories, kindred to the established labs around the area. The work was destined to be completed by April this year. Still, witnessing the condition, it will undoubtedly take more than a year. The estimated cost is around 10 crores.",
      "Library:",
      "One of the most awaited construction updates is of the fountain in front of the library, which has been dysfunctional for around 7 years, and there are no signs of its revival. Sources say it will be made into a Japanese Water Garden, which you can witness for yourself if you’re seated at a good vantage point nearby. The work is undertaken, and the area is all covered, ultimately disrupting your field of vision. All one can hope for is a dramatic transformation of the ground to bring back the lost fascination of all. Or one can be delighted by the fact that the area won’t serve as a breeding ground for tadpoles, waterborne diseases and fungi in monsoon anymore.",

      "On the occasion of Teachers’ Day every year, IIT Kanpur honors faculty members who have excelled in teaching by awarding them the Distinguished Teacher Award. This year it was conferred on Prof. Surajit Sinha (Dept. of Economic Sciences) and Prof. Rahul Varman (Dept. of IME).Vox had the chance to interact with Prof. Sinha, learn about his journey from a student to a teacher. In this conversation, he candidly shares stories of his GRE application, his days as a young teacher with some suggestions for improving our academic system.",
      "First and foremost sir, congratulations sir for receiving the Distinguished Teacher Award!",
      "Thank you very much! In fact, I have received it because of you people. You guys give those scores – the Student Reaction Survey numbers. To be honest with you, I didn’t expect this at all. There are many other professors who teach very well, but I am happy that they recognized me, after 31 years of hard work.",
      "31 years! That’s a huge period! Coming to the first question sir, kindly tell us about yourself, and your schooling and upbringing.",
      "The earliest that I remember is the first school I went to. It was a missionary school, St. Thomas Church School in Howrah, on the other side of Ganga, and I went there till class 4rth. That was a beautiful school – these Christian schools were founded many years back, full of lush greenery and nice teachers, and also a bit formal – I had to wear a tie and stuff, at all times, every day. Then my father changed his job, and we moved to Calcutta. After that, the school I went to was a very local, newly established school. They were still in the establishment phase, hiring teachers, and functioned from a rented residential complex. We never paid any attention to studies at that time, me and my siblings.",
      "But later, my father put me in a very successful school – South Point High School, in Calcutta. If all the branches of our school were combined, there were a total of about 10,000 students, in those days, I am talking about 1971. That was the first time that I experienced a good study environment. Those days they used to print the results of the board exams in the daily newspaper, and South Point used to dominate always. But unfortunately, the result of our batch was very weak. I don’t know what happened that year, some grave mistakes were made in checking the copies. I heard after the review that a person even got 200-250 marks more. My whole schooling was a mix of everything, in different proportions in different instances.",
      "After that, I joined St. Xavier’s College in Calcutta, run by the European Christians. It was not that the teachers were good then, but the atmosphere – oh that was amazing! South Point I never liked, it was admired for their achievements, but St. Xavier’s I personally liked and got attached to. As usual, my interests in economics deepened during my late schooling, and then it continued through undergraduate education, and finally I went for masters. I was never willing to go for masters; I could have easily gotten a job with only a bachelor’s degree, and also my father was falling very ill slowly, so a job became a necessity. But my father insisted, so I joined the economics department at Calcutta University. The masters’ department was located very far away, so I had to take a bus. And at that time they were digging up for Calcutta Metro, so it was all very muddy; you can’t even imagine how it became during the rains! So it was a great big struggle. But that university took me to a different level. Most of the professors there had a foreign degree, in those days. So you can guess how good the department was.",
      "My urge to earn as early as possible died down, and pursuing further studies became my main aim, and now I was stuck with economics. Now my father again motivated me, this time to go abroad. I wanted to stay in India, study here. Generally, the procedure is that you appear for GRE, get the scores for that, and prepare your CV, ask for financial assistance, and then the foreign universities consider you for admission. My father never wanted me to wait this much. Believe me or not, he started to write my whole CV in an inland letter, and that too without GRE! And even got admission at McMaster University in Canada!(Laughs). There I gained a lot, enjoyed a lot, and finally got settled for economics.",

      "What changes do you observe from the time you joined the institute, and now, mostly in your teaching field?",
      "I’d talk about the academic changes majorly. So when I joined, there were fewer students. That way, the class sizes were small, I’d see every person, remember their faces, there would be constant interaction with everyone. Nowadays, I am kind of lost; I don’t know who is sitting in this class, can’t recognize their faces either. Both the physical and psychological distance has become too large. The students are lost too, I guess. In the starting 10 years of my teaching, I had daily interaction with students, and they used to give me hell! The quality and quantity of doubts that they had for me, it is nowhere to the doubts that I get nowadays. Back then, I was a teacher teaching the course, but now they have got used to an instructor instructing for the course. This is not how education works. I have become more like a ‘neta’ who comes on stage just for his campaigning, and there’s no proper communication from the listener’s side.",
      "What prompted you to get into teaching, and what were the primary difficulties that you faced in your early years in teaching and in living here?",
      "This academic profession has the permanent feature of teaching associated with it. Research and teaching go hand-in-hand. So I never thought of teaching to earn, but it just came in my way and I worked my way out. In my early years, power supply was a huge problem. Power would go off in the midst of a class, and in the summers, it became very difficult. No A/Cs, no generator; climate change hadn’t occurred yet.(Laughs)",
      "But more importantly, imagine what would happen in the laboratories – experiments which were running continuously for 10-12 hours, would totally be wasted. Finally, in the mid-90s, a direct line from the Panki powerplant was constructed which greatly reduced the power problem.Also, the library was a little insufficient. Indian author books were easily available, but the foreign books came in dollars, hence they bought only 1 or 2 copies. Still, the students managed through photocopies.",
      "The major problem occurred in daily activities. At that time, there were little-to-none infrastructure facilities, one of which was the power issue. Adding to that was the problem with the Institute Works Department (IWD). it used to be a nightmare for us: we had to lodge a written complaint, there was no internet, and so it remained at the table of the govt. officers for many days. If your tap is leaking, it will continue to do so until you remind them thrice. And there was no option for that: there were no private service providers so far from the city. In those days we felt like we were living on an island. Once, the senior most person of the IWD, the Superintendent Engineer (‘bada baabu’as we used to call him) was called in front of the frustrated faculty members. It was so fierce, I literally thought they would beat up thebada baabu! (Laughs)",
      "This has improved unbelievably now. You lodge a complaint on Pingala and immediately under 2-3 hours someone would be at your house fixing your problems. I can’t even imagine the offline IWD now. It was such a mess!",
      "As a conclusion, what is the message that you want to give to the current student community at IITK?",
      "They should always be respectful of the studies and the teachers. If they have any problem, they should be very open about it, to whomever they think might be good to listen to them. Always keep a door open for the second opinion of an issue – if you think you know everything, you won’t be able to gain anything.",
      "This is all I have to say, because we are reaching a point where the adults are making huge mistakes, and the students have to be vigilant but have to find ways to deal with it, because they are the ones who’ll be heading the country and make it progress. There was a time when you could blindly accept what your father and grandfather had to say, and it would probably turn out to be the best for you, but now the society is evolving very quickly due to technological changes.",
      "So the students have to take responsibility for themselves, and also somehow communicate to the other side. They may not listen, because there is so much ego problem. “Who are they to correct us?” they might say. But young minds are very intelligent, I know how dull I have become now. But you have to be open to ideas, open to debates. This is all I have to say, this sums it up.",

      "Forum for Academic Freedom, IIT Kanpur (FfAF) organized a session “IITK as an Academic Space through the years: A Personal Journey” on 7th February 2020. The session was aimed to be an interactive session with Professor Harish Karnick, who’s been a part of IITK since 1969, first as a student and now as a professor. Vox presents to you what happened at the session. Note that the views are entirely his and the statements made here are based on the comments he made in the session.",
      "Prof. Karnick spoke about how he came to IITK for counseling and noticed the absence of walls. The halls of residence, the academic area, and the outside world were all one entity and weren’t separated by walls. He joined IITB post counseling and feels times have changed since he was a student, pointing out to a recent notice sent out by the Director of IITB.",
      "He began with the definition of an academic space. An academic space, in his views, is a cohort of individuals who ingress or egress (slow) and share two important attributes:",
      "He then progressed into some intriguing questions, those about the existence of God, about the flat Earth theory and about the Geocentric theory. When there were a few hesitant raised hands during some questions, he remarked,“the basic axiom of having an academic space is raising hands confidently when one believes in something.”",
      "Next, he mentioned certain instances which he feels are extremely worrisome trends. Notably:",
      "Extending his argument to the entire nation, he said that one cannot see IITK as an academic space when the rest of the country or the world is going otherwise. He hopes that the things are being done under coercion because there is no other palpable explanation.",
      "To illustrate his idea of justified beliefs, he used the following example of Whatsapp messages he receives on how Muslims will outdo Hindus in population-",
      "He presented this data from the 2001-2011 census-",
      "",
      "By assuming the rate of increase in population to be constant and using basic math, he showed how it would take 27 decades for the populations of Hindus and Muslims to equalize, and that in this scenario, the population of the country would reach more than 132 billion as well. He moreover presented data from the 1991-2001 census to show that the rate of increase in population was decreasing for both the communities, but more so for Muslims than for Hindus.",
      "“I simply gave you all an example of justified truth. I want you all to justify the truth.”, he said after the example.",
      "He continued by recalling how the Students’ Gymkhana came into existence, how wardens were just to sign cheques and how arguments were settled through proper discussions. Moving ahead, he talked about a couple of major events that happened in the institute-",
      "In 1972, there was a Minimum Wage movement in IITK and a big general strike happened. All the employees who weren’t faculties were hired in an ad-hoc fashion. Since this land is very fertile (near Ganga), it was considered natural for IITK to employ people from nearby villages who were displaced from their land. At that time, the students actively led and participated in the movement. Many people got together and the Institute helped them create a Minimum Wage Committee. The BoG decided to regularise all these workers.",
      "He added a couple of examples:",
      "The point he aimed at expressing through these examples was–“Academic spaces are entities that are influenced by the outside world. Hence, it is up to us to keep these spaces alive. If we are pressurized by some intermediate levels in our Institute, we must stand up and say that academic spaces are academic spaces. You and I can differ but it is not a reason to be uncivil to each other or hurt each other, physically or mentally.”",
      "He closed the session with a couple of appeals-",

      "“Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.” – Lyndon B. Johnson",
      "On 20th January evening, the Counselling Service conducted the session “From Lost To Found” under the ongoing SAMVAD initiative. The event started with a video of the personal account of a student who had faced severe mental health issues during and after his summer internship. This was followed by a panel discussion on the problems faced by students at IIT Kanpur. The panel consisted of students and counselors at our college. Questions were taken from the audience on placards and were addressed by the panelists.",
      "It was followed by the narration of an anonymous account of a student who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for years now.",
      "It was the story of a Ph.D. student, who immediately struggled with the grading scheme of IIT Kanpur the moment he came here. He already had anxiety problems beforehand but here it was intertwined with depression. He sought counseling in the first semester itself and it took him a year to improve bit by bit. Even as he found himself improving, a catastrophe stormed him back to his old place. And in between the cry and pain, yet again he gathered the courage to call his counselor, to ask for assistance. Thus began another journey of improvement. This time, hopefully, one that lasted. That’s just how these things are. You never know what will happen but you gotta keep trying.",
      "Through personal insights, he observed that talking, to anyone, helped him a lot. Some thoughts in your brain aren’t very good for you. They need to be shared. And one has to muster the courage to pick up his phone and call that person in his life he can count on. That is the essence of counseling. Reach out and simply talk.",
      "Towards the end, our NCC Chief, Lt. Colonel Ashok Mor, who was sitting in the audience, narrated an immensely courageous account of his own life. He shared with everyone the story of how he met with a horrific accident where he lost one of his legs and how he was able to get back at his feet again, despite all odds.",
      "The event was concluded by a thank you note from the Head of Counselling Service, Prof. Nandini Nilakantan.",
      "The aim of the session was to make people at ease with problems surrounding mental health and encourage them to talk about the problems they face in their own lives. The initiative, SAMVAD, a talk and discussion series aiming to spread mental health awareness on campus and to initiate associated discussions among the community was started by the Counselling Service last year.",

      "Shri. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, our Hon’ble Union Minister of Human Resource Development, visited IIT Kanpur as the Chief Guest for our Foundation Day Celebration on 02/11/19. Vox got the opportunity to interact with him personally and get his opinions over a quick QnA session. Here’s the full interview:",
      "Ques- How has your visit to IIT Kanpur been so far?",
      "Ans- It has been nice, very nice. IIT Kanpur has a long history of its own. As I have already said, IIT Kanpur hosts the scent of India’s independence as well. Feelings of patriotism will lead our nation to make strides forward, and IIT Kanpur will most definitely play a big role in this process.",
      "Ques- There has been a lot of discussion throughout the nation on the issue of MTech. fees hike in IITs. What do you have to say about it?",
      "Ans- There is a faulty notion in place here. The truth is, we want students to do MTech. When we analyze this issue, we are actually just taking the required fee from them. What has been happening till now is that students who really want to pursue MTech andgo into the research field are being deprived of opportunities while others, in the name of MTech, prepare for something else. A sizeable chunk of them did not come here for MTech, but rather just for the resources. They waste seats that could have been used by students really interested in research. But even then, the government hasn’t taken any measure on its own. It has left the decision to be made by the institutions. If they feel like increasing their fees, they can. We, in fact, encourage students to go for MTech. We have a lot of scholarship programs in place for deserving students. Our intentions are for the good of the students.",
      "Ques- As the Minister of Human Resource Development, what challenges do you face and how do you plan to tackle them?",
      "Ans- The biggest challenge right now is to take our country to the peak, and to figure out innovative ways to do so through a combination of modern knowledge, science, and technology with our culture and ancient practices. Our new education policy will include all these elements and increase our population’s employability. We will implement a very “India-centric” education system. As our Prime Minister has said, we need creation in this new India. We need a prosperous, healthy and united India, which is recognized by the whole world. Not only do we want this India to fulfill its citizens’ demands, but also be the central point for the world’s expectations. In fact, it is already on that path.",
      "Ques- What are the Ministry’s plans for Research and Development in our country?",
      "Ans- As PM Modi has said, when our country gained its independence, our borders were not secureand we were going through a severe grain shortage. At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the slogan of“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”(Hail the soldier, hail the farmer). The nation successfully tackled the situation. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee came, he realized that we needed more development in the field of science, and thus he added the phrase“Jai Vigyan”(Hail science). And today, as is evident from projects like Chandrayaan 2, we have made immense progress in science. Our PM has now added the phrase“Jai Anusandhan”(Hail research) to the slogan. And for that, our government is establishing the ‘National Research Foundation’ or the NRF. With the help of IITs, Germany and India are working together in fields of mutual and interdisciplinary research.Through our initiatives likeSwayam Prabha, we are running a lot of courses. We are also working in fields of higher education.",

      "Even before a book reaches the New Arrivals section, it goes through a long process. While you may only see the books placed on shelves waiting to be read, there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes to bring them to them. The Acquisition and Technical Unit procures books, adds records to the database, catalogs new arrivals, and prepares them with all the right labels so that they can finally be issued without a hitch. Did you ever imagine this to have so many stages?",
      "So let’s start at the very beginning when there was no sun and the sky was dark. Okay, not that early.",
      "Acquisition of Books",
      "‘Who decides which books should be added to the library?’ you wonder. Not surprisingly though, each new book is added to the library on a professor’s request. Every faculty member, as well as every department, has a predetermined budget for procuring books. If you’re not keen on the fine details, you may skip the next paragraph. But hey, not like a paragraph will kill you with boredom.",
      "Well, the professor sends an indent form to the library for the book. If he already has got the vendor for the book, the vendor’s memo is sent along with the indent form. In this case, an approval form is sent to the vendor. On the other hand, if the book has to be acquired from a to-be-known vendor, quotations are requested from various vendors and then a non-approval form is sent to the selected vendor requesting the book.",
      "Interestingly allthe figures and details related to new acquisitionsare available online (within the IITK network).",
      "Accessioning(Now that’s a cool word isn’t it?)",
      "Now that the book has reached the library, the next step is adding the book to the library records. Details of the book are entered into the accession register. Each book is given a unique number called the accession number which is usually of the form AXXXXXX (where the Xs represent some Arabic numerals). This number acts as a primary means of identification. It is worth mentioning that the accession number is not related to the type of book in any way.",
      "Cataloging",
      "To make finding books easy, the library follows a system known as the Dewey Decimal Classification in which related books are placed together. DDC is used in libraries all over the world and uses the ideas of relative location and relative index. The classification’s notation makes use of three-digitArabic numeralsfor main classes, with decimals for further details. This classification provides the call number of the book.",
      "Another number given is the cutter number which is constructed from the title, the author’s name and other details like edition.",
      "",
      "Let’s see an example to wrap this around our heads. Consider the book in the image, ‘A Walk Through Combinatorics’ by Miklos Bona. It has call number 511.6. This can be explained by the following classification hierarchy:",
      "500 Natural sciences and mathematics",
      "510 Mathematics",
      "511 General topics",
      "511.6 Combinatorics",
      "Now notice the cutter number B64w3. The ‘B’ stands for Bona, the author’s name. The ‘w’ comes from ‘Walk’ in the title and the ‘3’ is for the third edition.",
      "Who knew those seemingly random characters could make so much sense!",
      "Hopefully, now you are slightly better equipped to understand those weird numbers on books, and how they’re not really that weird. The arrangement of books on the shelves starts making more sense and you can even guess why there are so many books in the 500s and considerably fewer in the 100s or so.",
      "This classification is not always very easy to do. For instance, ‘A Companion to Popular Culture’ sounds like it is about culture and gets 306(the class for cultural books) as its main class. But can you tell where you should put ‘Young Tableaux’ by Fulton? (No, we don’t have a goddamn clue either). You probably realize that classification is no meek task, and so, hats off to those who get this work done day and day so that we find easily what we need.",
      "Once classified, details about the book with these numbersare added to the records as a MARC 21 entry. MARC stands for MAchine Readable Cataloging. MARC is the international standard for bibliographic records.",
      "Tooling",
      "Once the book is cataloged, it is sent for getting dressed up, or, more technically, the process of tooling. Various labels with the numbers mentioned earlier and barcodes are then put on the book. The barcodes make the process of issuing and returning considerably seamless. Some other things like the card pocket and date slip are also attached in this step.",
      "",
      "To the Present",
      "And finally, the book is ready to hit the New Arrivals display. All the books procured in the last week are displayed for a week starting Monday. Those emails you get every week?",
      "The library is not just a big bunch of books but many people working together to bring to the readers a great reading experience. While most of us may not know much of their work, we have tried to give you a glimpse of what actually goes on behind the scenes and how much effort is required to make everything work smoothly.",
      "A hearty thanks to the amazing library staff to help us with the info and making this series possible, and leaving us wondering how much we are yet to learn about our own college.",

      "With the advent of IT in almost all walks of life, the sector of analytics has seen an aggressive upsurge. This growth was also reflected in the placement statistics of IITK Students in 2019.",
      "Analyst jobs were the second-most sought after profiles,attracting students across all branches. Around 200 students got placed in the Analytics sector this year, which is an increase of 25% as compared to 2018. The branch-wise distribution of jobs in this sector was more even, as compared to the IT and Core sectors. Students pursuing an MBA in Industrial and Management Engineering, and MSc in Statistics got the highest number of offers in the analytics sector.",

      "",
      "“In God we trust, all others must bring data,” said the late American Statistician, W. Edwards Deming, and it seems that most business companies have started following this notion, for, in recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of companies hiring data analysts. This year, a total of 55 companies offered analyst jobs to students, which is significantly greater than the number of companies offering IT/Software jobs (45) and Core Engineering jobs (30).",
      "The sector also saw students getting placed in a variety of roles. This is accredited to the fact that the field of big data analytics has a very wide scope, and every branch of Analytics is unique in terms of the skill set it requires. Another consequence of this is that the field of analytics is not specific to any one branch, although students pursuing Statistics definitely have an edge over others.",
      "",
      "",
      "Following the pattern of the last few years,the number of core engineering and technology jobs offered witnessed a decreaseagain this year. The number of students getting placed in the Core sector was 138, which is almost 30% less as compared to 2017. The sector was overwhelmingly dominated by EE students, with semi-conductor giants like Intel and Qualcomm offering the major chunk of jobs in the sector. About62.50% of all M.Tech. students placed in Core engineering jobs were from the EE department. The branch wise distribution of B.Tech. was however more even across departments.",
      "In recent years, a paradigm shift of engineering graduates taking up consultancy and management jobs has been observed. Several factors have been attributed to this change, ranging from better pay-scales to more creatively-exhausting jobs. Also, the analytical skills acquired by an Engineering graduate turn out to be very helpful in the management sector, inviting management firms to offer campus placements in IITs.The increase in Management offers should also be attributed to the IME department.",
      "",
      "The number of offers in consultancy has historically remained very low but this year the displacement increased, with Consultancy as well as Management offers surging over the number of offers by top 5 recruiters from other fields. In total,97 students were placed in consultancy and management jobs, which accounts foralmost 15% of the total number of students placed. ICICI Bank and American Express were the top recruiters in the Management sector, whereas Genpact and EXL Services offered the majority of consultancy jobs.",
      "Additionally, after the end of  Phase-I(01/12 – 14/12) of Placements 2019 over 250 firms had visited on campus for recruitment, offering a total of 1080 offers with 935 acceptances by the students. These numbers are significantly higher compared to that of last year (i.e. 847) after Phase-I.",

Do watch out for some trivia and facts that could help you to use the library to your benefit. We also peek into how the library system works and hope to make you realize that it is as magnificent as our library itself.",

With more than 28 thousand books in our library (now that’s a LOT) and anywhere between 40 to 150 books being added to this collection every Monday, have you wondered where they finally end up? We follow the journey of the book from the shelf to its doom!",
      "Binding Section",
      "Ever noticed the binding section on the second floor? That’s where the damaged and old books go for a nice restoration.",
      "",
      "The office is responsible for sending books and journals for binding. The binding earlier used to be done in the library’s basement itself, but is now outsourced to vendors on campus.There was a time monthly journals were just essential, but now we all have digital copies of them. Earlier, monthly journals were bounded in sets of 12. “Currently, only the remaining old journals and decaying books are sent for binding,” said a staff member at the binding section.When a book isn’t requested for more than several years, it’s time to say goodbye! Such books are bound and sent to the basement for the years to come.",
      "The Basement – Where Future meets the Past",
      "The mysterious and silent basement is a fascinating place to visit. As you slide the grill of the lift and venture into the basement, you see the unexpected:",
      "Tall and unending lines of racks, which look like gold vaults, straight outta some Hollywood movie, huh? Now, this is what we call theCompactorSirjee! And for a good reason! In 2015, P.K. Kelkar library installed this expensive set up in the basement, the Compactor enables the library to store old books in an extremely space-effective manner. It was introduced due to the space crunch in the library. It has huge movable shelves, placed close to each other, to maximize storage space.",
      "",
      "If you rotate the wheel like Captain Jack sparrow you’ll see that the shelves shift along the rails. You can then slip into the gap and find your book. Otherwise, the shelves stay close together, letting you fit a stupendous amount of books in there. The Compactor has 151 such racks, each numbered and organized by call numbers(more on that later) so that it can be accessed readily. Books that were unused since 2009 were shifted to the Compactor in 2015, to make space for newer books and study spaces. And by the way, remember the studying area on the second-floor corridor you see today? That was all filled with racks before 2015.",
      "Who told the Compactor was the only surprise in the basement? The basement also hosts the Archive section. The Archive section does what it’s called—it preserves all things old and tattered. It hosts a High-speed Overhead Book Scanner that brings us from the past to the present. This high-tech scanner is used in the archive section to preserve old books, documents, and journals by digitizing them. Currently, it is being used to digitize records of former employees.",
      "The archive section also houses framed and unframed pictures and C.D.s (containing videos) of Institute events like Convocation, Golden Jubilee Celebration, among others.",
      "",
      "In the archive section is a huge framed picture of Prof. P.K. Kelkar laying the foundation stone for the institute, a memorable moment in the history of our institute!",
      "“The basement used to house the printing section, binding section, and the graphics card section,” he recalls.You ask what graphic cards are? Before the online system, the circulation of books was tracked by using an intricate system of graphic cards. You can see those near the stairs on the second floor, even to this day.",
      "Remember the closed grilled gate in the library building visible from the side of the Faculty Building? It opens up into the basement, in front of the archive section. This gate was used to move books and machinery in and out of the library in the past.",
      "But what happens to the books after they are kept in the Compactor? Books are immortal, just as knowledge is. You’ll find 50 years’ old copies of Economic Times in the library. But books do gradually fall into oblivion. They remain in the Compactor for a long time, but eventually, everything returns to dust.",
      "At this time, it is fascinating to ask- Why are these books still there? Does someone care to read Newton’s original thesis when much more refined interpretations of the same exist? Why does the library put in so much effort and space in storing books that are decades and centuries old? We’ll leave it for you to think! We meet soon in the upcoming “Present” and “Past” articles.",

      "On 4th November 2019, Mr. Abhishek Aryan Sinha, a final year undergraduate student and a current resident of Hall of Residence 1 wrote an email to the Dean of Student’s Affairs expressing his concerns over various issues the hall residents had been facing.",
      "Two days later, on 6th November 2019, while Abhishek was out for a lecture, he received multiple calls from the hall office which he could not respond to then. On calling back, he was informed that the hall warden wanted to meet him urgently in the hall office. Abhishek demanded a formal mail regarding the same which he never received.",
      "After the lecture, he received another call from one of his wingmates informing him that some hall office staff had come looking for him in the wing. Finding Abhishek absent they had locked up his room with a lock they brought with themselves.",
      "Later on the same day, Abhishek received another request to see the warden. As he had a pre-scheduled meeting with the Director at the same time he replied in negative. Soon after, he received a text from his wingmate that his room had been unlocked by a hall office staff. Post concluding his meeting with the Director, Abhishek alongside a few other hall residents met the wardens. The discussion on the various hall related issues followed.",
      "On being questioned about why was Abhishek’s room locked, the warden clarified that the room had been locked for the safety of his belongings. They searched for Abhishek in the hall and when they could not find him he ordered the staff to lock his room. Students argued that other rooms of the hall were also unlocked but they were not subjected to the same action. The act of locking the room, they argued, is not a routine practice and was purposefully done targeting Abhishek.",
      "The warden had recently sent out an email to the hall, a part of which read, “For your information, hall premise is not a private place which includes your room. Hence, you may not do what you indent do at your home, which is considered as your private place.” Some students had also reported a verbal order asking them to keep the door ajar when someone from the opposite sex was present inside. When questioned on the same the warden argued that having your door locked with a girl inside raises doubts. The warden further added, as has been reported by the students present at the meeting, “For your information, Sir, I have seen a girl and a boy naked.” He particularly stressed on the fact that we are living in India and not the USA. On further argument, he concluded, “You guys can do whatever you want. I am not anymore going to follow that one (on his previous orders). You want to lock, lock! You can bring one, two, ten (talking about the issue of having girls in the room), I’m okay with it.” He further concluded that he was okay with all that the students do and they can go and spoil themselves.",
      "Thereafter, several students present at the meeting, report that the warden shouted at Abhishek for mailing his grievance, claiming that he was trying to defame the hall management and the wardens and reiterating that there were no such issues in the hostel. The warden said that not keeping him in CC while registering a complaint with DoSA was, for him, an attempt to defame him and the hall. When students argued that even after multiple complaints there has been no action from the hall administration, the warden replied that he was unaware of the issues because the hall lacked proper communication channels. He insisted the students to file complaints through complaint registers. However, the students claimed that it was exactly what they have been doing. The complaint registers, when considered, had unattended entries confirming the claims.",
      "The meeting ended on this note. The conclusions of it and the actions taken by the hall administration are still awaited."

      "On 30th October 2019, a General Body Meeting (GBM) was called by the Students’ Gymkhana to address several issues that needed public discourse. Three main agendas that were pushed in the meeting by Student Gymkhana executives were Hostel Governance, Issues with the Student Affairs Office, and Disregard of Student Resolutions by the administration.",
      "It started with a recent issue wherein three students from Hall 8 were given eviction notices allegedly for having a verbal spat with the warden in a hall level GBM. The warden demanded unconditional apologies from the students. While two students gave an unconditional apology, one student was asked to vacate the hall because the mail sent by him challenged the argument given by the wardens. A similar past incident from Hall 11, wherein the HEC alleges that the Warden In Charge revoked the mailing rights of student members and disregarded the mandate of the same, was brought into the light.",
      "The Student Executives collectively claimed that although as per the institute ordinances, the Warden-in-Charge of the concerned hall of residence has the power to reprimand /impose fine or take any other such suitable measure against any resident of the hall, who violates either the rules and regulations or the Code of Conduct pertaining to the concerned hall of residence, no documents clearly state that the warden can evict a resident, in cases like those of Hall 8.",
      "",
      "They highlighted some “fundamental” flaws in the Hall Management policy of the institute like the non-implementation of Hall Constitutions. They pointed out that although some halls do have a constitution, they have not been ratified by the Academic Senate, while other halls simply don’t have one. To ensure better management, they proposed the idea of a Model Constitution currently in discussion at the Council of Students for Hostel Affairs (CoSHA) to be itemised and approved by the Academic Senate. All halls will be required to submit a constitution within a reasonable timeline, with the Model Constitution as the basis.",
      "",
      "One of the key issues that were raised was the lack of involvement of HEC in the appointment of Warden In Charge, wherein the current system involves appointment by the Director, on the recommendation of DOSA that is discussed with the Associate Dean Hostel Affairs (ADHA), with no real involvement of HEC. To ensure a better connect between HEC and Hall Administration, it was proposed that as a policy, HEC members could recommend three names with an order of preference to the Dean, Students’ Affairs which will be discussed in a committee and forwarded to the Director. Lack of proper redressal mechanism for disputes between hall members and wardens was also raised.",
      "One particular matter related to accommodation of MS by Research (MSR) students was also highlighted. The duration of the stay of MSR students is not defined, but the hall administration treats them as extended students after a duration of 2-years. These students are not provided with proper accommodation, and they cannot even present their case to anyone because the warden has supreme authority over the issue. It was pointed out that these are some loopholes in the system which really need to be looked into.",
      "The GBM also highlighted the problems with the general demeanour, attitude, and actions of the Associate Dean of Students’ Affairs. The student representatives claimed to have experienced a structural exclusion from the system on multiple fronts which warns of a scary shift in the administration’s outlook towards students’ say on campus issues. Unavailability in his office and on other media, unreasonable demands and unprofessional demeaning comments towards certain students have served as major hindrances in the communication of the Associate Dean Student Affairs (ADSA), with the students. In an executive dissent, the Festival Coordinators of the three festivals along with all the  Gymkhana executives raised issues regarding delays in the approval of a lot of permissions and MoUs in this tedious bureaucratic process, exclusion from strangely timed Gymkhana Festival Advisory Committee (GFAC) meetings and the changes proposed in handling festival finances.",
      "Another important issue that was discussed was the disregard of the resolutions passed by the Students’ Senate. A recent office order barred students previously punished by the SSAC (Senate Student Affairs Committee) to hold any positions of responsibility in the Students’ Gymkhana in the future. The executives expressed dissent over this order and felt that this deprives the students who have redeemed themselves from the probation period from gaining essential co-curricular learning and is detrimental for mental well-being as well. As the provision of disciplinary probation with the clause of disallowing students to hold any position of responsibility is already in place, they feel that SSAC should reserve the discretion to award appropriate action on a case to case basis. Additionally, the Students’ Senate feels that a modification to the SSAC manual without being approved by the Academic Senate violates due procedure and undermines the authority of the Academic Senate as the highest decision-making body within the institute.",
      "Student’s Gymkhana plans on starting a public signature campaign to convey these issues and garner public support, and then take them to the Director’s Office. They also plan on re-conducting a GBM, this time preferably with the Director present, to give him a better perspective on these problems. The next step would be planned based on his overall response to the issues.",
      "To make democracy work, we must be a nation of participants, not simply observers. IITK has had a rich legacy of active students’ participation in various fields throughout the years. This GBM attempted to draw upon that legacy and unite the students in order to solve the issues prevailing in the campus. Only time would tell whether this GBM succeeded in doing so."

      "IIT-K is one of the most prestigious institutes in the country. It has an excellent academic reputation, several unique facilities for research and world-class faculty. It has a vast alumni network and close to 100% placements are reported every year. And yet, it is a matter of concern that in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings of 2020, IIT-K was ranked 9thamong Indian universities, behind other IITs like IIT-B, IIT-D, IIT-M, IIT-KGP and institutes such as IISC Bangalore, BITS-Pilani, University of Mumbai and University of Delhi.",
      "The QS Graduate Employability Rankings have been designed to compare universities around the world in terms of the future prospects and career options they offer to their graduate students. They are a metric to help compare the employability of graduating students. While QS rankings for Indian institutes have always been under the scanner, they are one of the strongest metrics available out there, especially when it comes to global reputation.",
      "[infogram id=”dashboard-red-1hke60epv70w45r?live”]",
      "How Are The Rankings Calculated?",
      "The rankings are computed on the basis of a score that is assigned to each university on the basis of certain parameters. These parameters include Employer Reputation, Alumni Outcomes, Partnerships with Employers Per Faculty, Employer/Student Connections and Graduate Employment Rate. These indicators have different weights towards calculating the final score of the university.",
      "1.Employer Reputation (30%): This indicator is based on the QS Employer Survey which asks over 45000 employers to identify which institute’s graduates they find to be most competent and resourceful.",
      "2.Alumni Outcomes (25%): This metric analyses which universities have produced various high achievers in different fields.",
      "3.Partnerships with Employer Per Faculty (25%): This indicator assesses which institutes are collaborating with global companies around the world to produce impactful and pioneering research. It also looks at the placement related partnerships of institutes.",
      "4.Employer Student Connections (10%): It assesses the active presence of companies in the form of career fairs, career presentations in the university over a period of twelve months.",
      "5.Graduate Employment Rate (10%): It estimates the proportion of graduates who are able to obtain employment within twelve months of leaving the institute excluding the students who pursue further studies.",
      "What does the SPO think?",
      "Vox interviewed the SPO Chairman, Prof Kantesh Balani, to know about their views on the issue. According to him, ‘The QS Graduate Employability Rankings are a global index. Most probably, we fall behind in the Employer Reputation parameter due to the lack of international offers received by IIT-K students, unlike IIT-B and IIT-D students.‘",
      "IIT Kanpur was ranked 5th in Employer Reputation, behind IIT-B, IIT-D, IIT M, University of Delhi and IIT KGP respectively, implying that we scored the worst among all the IITs that made it into top 10. The Chairman’s responded to this by saying that there have been no reports that claim that students lack technical acumen, ‘However, it is true that a few years back we received reports saying students are comparatively less prepared for interviews, especially for HR. We have taken steps to improve the situation. The new Career Development Cell has taken many sessions to improve the same.’",
      "IIT-K has the lowest score among the top five IITs in the Alumni Reputation Metric suggesting that IIT-K has statistically failed to produce high achieving alumni in recent years. Commenting on this situation, he admitted that IIT-K has produced lesser startups than other IITs. However, facilities like Deferred Placements and Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre are working in this direction. He believes that research at IIT-K is at par with international standards. However, more publicity needs to be given to change the recent negative perceptions about IIT-K.",
      "He remarked that being at the top for many years, the need to publicize research output never felt necessary. ‘But when we started sliding downwards, we realized that consistent efforts are needed to redeem the public perception of IIT-K, especially in India.’He stressed on the fact that the reputation outside India was still intact, and improvements are only required within India.",
      "",
      "Are they really reliable?",
      "Like any global ranking system, QS also has its shortcomings. One can easily notice the missing cells in the data provided. For IIT Kanpur, only Alumni Outcomes and Employer Reputation have real values. While all the other cells stand blank. Similarly, only IIT M scores a perfect 100 in the Graduate Employment rate while other institutes don’t have any data against them. QS argues that it only gives numerical data for top 400 performers in a given indicator, and avoids releasing the values for the rest. Although they account for the real numbers while calculating the rankings, but a lack of transparency does exist.",
      "Also, Alumni Outcomes is an indicator that gives undue advantages to Universities over IITs as the former have a large diverse multi-disciplinary student base, as compared to IITs where most of the students major in engineering. For example, Alumni excellence in non-technical fields like psychology or philosophy is easily achievable for universities like DU and the University of Mumbai. With that said, credible or not, they are one of the largest ranking databases in the world, and underperformance in these rankings does hurt the reputation of IIT Kanpur as an institute, and the right moves to tackle this are expected from both administration and students.",
      "Poor Rankings and not being conferred as an Institute of Eminence (IoE), have garnered a lot of attention from the IIT Kanpur community. This is only one of the many articles we plan to release on our reputation, outreach, and related effects, so stay tuned.",

      "A lot of clubs would agree that this year they had a sufficient amount of time for performing their acts. 2 years back, mime participants were not able to perform due to timing issues, which was disappointing. Shifting the event to the Auditorium helped ease the crunch for performance slots. The OAT did not have a projector so having the event over there would have been unfair to Film Club and other clubs who wanted to show their videos.",
      "This time around the council introduced Wristbands for the Freshers’ Night. First of all, they helped in screening and prioritizing entries to the Y19 and the club secretaries and coordinators. Secondly, they had pool names on them, thus being the first introduction of the freshers with their pools. “It was the last chance to get them to know about this system which would be almost impossible if not done around this time. Once this system is gone it will be gone forever”, the then (Officiating) General Secretary, Media and Culture said. There is an implicit need for healthy competition for the performances to prosper.",
      "For the first time, the council had an official sponsor for Freshers’ Night and were able to acquire an impressive amount of funds which helped ease the logistic requirements for the event and expand its scale. Also, the PG participation was encouraging this time around. Several clubs agreed that a relatively larger number of PGs came in for the preparation this year and many of them performed on the night. But even more importantly, they had PGs acting as mentors for the freshers. Also for the first time, an informal session was conducted for PG freshers, introducing the Council and its huge diversity to them.",
      "A lot of clubs came out with flying colors. Manish Chandra Yadav, Hindi Sahitya Sabha Coordinator, said that this year as the conduction was in the auditorium, some parts of their poetry might not have been audible to the audience sitting far behind. “Yet we did great, our performance is generally divided into halves- an initial half, which a 20 day old Y19 could relate to, and the other literary half- which reflects our main value as a club. Luckily, we were able to execute both these halves almost perfectly.” The HSS also observed increased participation by both PGs and UGs.",
      "The Film club as well raised the ante. Continuing the improvement they made last year, this year too they released 3 videos, made by freshers in groups of 10 people per video, mentored by the secretaries. “The highlight was the migration from JEE centric themes to more mature themes. One of the videos addressing homosexuality which was widely appreciated. The quality of the videos also saw a great improvement as compared to previous years.”, said Aviral Khare, Coordinator Film Club.",
      "“What happened was unfortunate. For  Mr. and Ms. Freshers’ mishap, in totality, I accept that what happened was wrong. I give my unconditional apology for it. My intention was not to have things happen the way they did. The people who are criticizing it are not wrong. If the student felt uncomfortable due to the events that happened, there can be no excuse for it and I extend my apology. There can be no argument that she should not have felt bad.",
      "Secondly, the objectionable remarks being passed by the audience were a major setback. As an organizer, I can say that if the students of IITK behave like this it is disappointing. The setback of the crowd was new for everyone. To take follow up responsibly on this incident, I took a step from my side. During the DJ night, which had a crowd of 500+, I first hand addressed the crowd about their irresponsible conduct as an audience on the previous day.",
      "I conveyed that what happened is not our culture. If someone perpetrates it in the name of culture then it’s utterly wrong. It is the responsibility of all of us as a community to continue conveying this to the Y19s in the social situations we encounter with them. Any such occurrences will be dealt with extreme severity as they have been earlier whether it be an offense by any individual or a collective pool.",
      "I would just like to emphasize that the responsibility for what happened as well as preventing it in future lies with the students and as such we should prioritize solving them among ourselves. We should maintain our trust in student-run bodies and mechanisms, and provide positive criticism for their improvement.”, the then officiating GenSec said."

      "This is a fact-based piece that has no intention of hurting any person, party and organisation involved. We take full responsibility for every fact mentioned in this article and can disclose all related proofs when asked by an authority to do so.",
      "There are two kinds of performers in an event, the ones who take the stage, and the others who sit offstage. The Y19 Fresher’s Night, organized on August 11th was a serious mishap in this regard. The ones who took the stage championed their cause but the audience was a major let down.  While a few performances did receive appreciation, the mood of the event was mostly disturbed by incessant hooting, abuses and sexist remarks. The specifics of the night have been subjects of heated debates and discussions around the campus tables off late. Here, Vox Populi examines the facts and the views of the various stakeholders.",
      "Mr. and Miss. Freshers, a competition organised by Antaragni and Media and Cultural (MnC) Council comprises of three stages: an elimination round based on nomination forms, followed by interviews with the organizing team, and a final on-stage performance in a pageant-like manner. During the final round, a finalist was asked by one of the judges to present a dialogue in a “seductive”  tone. Given the occasion, setting and the behaviour of the crowd, the appropriateness of the task is questionable. For someone who is just 20 days into the campus, standing under the spotlight in front of an audience of 1000 odd people already riled up, a question like this could be intimidating. She indeed says, “It was really embarrassing and I don’t want it to happen again.”",
      "For such events, prior communication between the organisers and the candidates is important. Mr Divyansh Verma- Festival Coordinator, Antaragni, one of the judges of the event, argued that the participants were well informed that they might be asked to perform embarrassing tasks for the final round. However, the statement seems to be unconvincing as his fellow Core Team Member Shreya Surabhi went on record to say that the participants denied any such communication. Further, one of the finalists differed with Divyansh on this point as well. The task in question involved the finalists to say a movie dialogue with emotions ranging sharply from love, disgust, anger, sadness to finally seduction. To this, Divyansh ambiguously replied, “She was not asked to seduce the audience using expressions but only to say the dialogue seductively.” This argument that only bodily expressions can qualify as derogatory and verbal statements cannot, is condemnable. He further added, “Had the same task been given to a male student or had the setting been different, it would not have been considered offensive. It was due to the unruliness of the crowd that the whole scene got sexualized”.",
      "Divyansh agreed that what happened shouldn’t have been the case and that both him and the Officiating General Secretary, Media and Culture, the other judge of the event, had apologized to the participant the very same day. According to the participant, the General Secretary visited her later and apologised if she was hurt in some way. But later on, added that “It was not a big mistake anyway.”",
      "Adding on to this chain of events, a mail that informed the participants of their selection for Mr and Ms Freshers’ final round was sent by Team Antaragni along with an embedded sheet containing remarks based on their preliminary auditions. Ranging from sexist slurs to linguistic discrimination and body shaming, the sheet is self-explanatory and extricates Vox of otherwise establishing the sexist nature of the Freshers’ night events as described afore.",
      "",
      "The remarks are embarrassing as they stand, but we could not go on without mentioning a few. “Sirf Sundar, uninteresting” for a girl student, “English nahi aati”and“Patla wala launda, Chakka”so to state. It is extremely disappointing that these comments come from the flag bearers and representatives of IITK’s media and culture.",
      "Mr Maulik Khanna, Head Events and Competitions, Antaragni’19 confidently claimed that,“the sheet when sent via mail did not contain any derogatory remarks”and that they were added by someone anonymous.He argues on the basis of the edit history of the sheet, which has now been deleted by the Antaragni team. On the contrary, one of the Freshers who received the sheet along with the mail confided that the sheet did not have edit access and that the remarks were already there before the Freshers’ night performances began. Since the sheet has been deleted, there is no way to verify that the remarks were added by anonymous people or if they were added by Team Antaragni.",
      "When asked if the comments were sexist, Maulik added that one of the remarks“aurat”for a certain Fresher could have been“sexist”in the hindsight, but wasn’t“inappropriate”since it was based on the fact that the person performed“mujra”as a part of his act. This thought process raises concerns, given that Antaragni caters to a variety of communities. While sending the sheet along with the mail was a mistake from the Antaragni team, the outlook of the judges is detestable.",
      "During the entire course of events of the Freshers’ Night, there was constant hooting and rash comments were being made by the audience which discouraged the performers even before they started performing on stage. The remarks passed ranged from loud abusive noises to sexist statements. Screenshots show the members of a certain club planning to disrupt the performance of another club even before the performances started. Antaragni again comes at the behest as for them the winning criteria would be the amount of hooting received. An event, that hinges on an “embarrassing task” as the final round and decides the winners based on hooting, raises concerns about the ideologies of the show-runners. It is for us to ponder if we wish this to continue.",
      "",
      "“I had prepared something else for the event, but seeing the nature of the crowd and the expectation of the seniors, I felt that this might be the culture of IIT Kanpur and this must be the routine every year. Had I known this before, I would have never participated in the event,’’ says the finalist under discussion. For someone who’s hardly a month old here, statements like these demonstrate the effect such events can have mentally and how we’re highly irresponsible in caring about every element of such events.",
      "The people and the interactions freshers experience, shape their thoughts and characters greatly. It is the responsibility of the campus community to ensure that this step of transition from a naive, immature adult to an educated and opinionated person who stands for the correct, happens the right way. Freshers’ Night, being the introductory event serves as a platform for freshers to showcase their talents and to bond through a bunch of opportunities. Hence, proper conduction of Freshers’ Night is integral to the development of a fresher. A number of individuals are responsible for this, and seeing people who’ve been under the scrutiny of strict disciplinary actions before in the judging and organizing team of such an important event raises serious questions about the appointment of such organisers. Promotion of something condemnable which can and has acted as a discouragement for freshers as a judging criterion is questionable and needs reconsideration. Leaving aside all our debates over the fabledculture, we have to realize that the objective of these events is to make the people who we in jest call “bachhas”, feel welcome to this one great family. Each of the elements of such an event needs to be weighed for their consequences. And this time around we have miserably failed as a community.",
      "Edit: A statement from Mr Maulik Khanna which was slightly misquoted has been edited. We are apologetic for any inconvenience caused to him or anyone else. For any further grievances contact the editorial board.",

      "Incubation, one among the many buzzwords that you might have heard in conversation with your “Entrepreneurially-motivated” friend. But as one transcends those casual conversations, you’ll get to know that incubation is an essential phase in every startup’s journey.Startup Incubation & Innovation Centre (SIIC) isa launchpad for purpose-driven entrepreneurs at IIT Kanpur. It provides Incubation facilities to students and Entrepreneurs in the diverse technological areas of Healthcare, Agri-Tech, Med-Tech, Robotics, Geoinformatics, Artificial Intelligence, and Social Entrepreneurship. Not just this, SIIC is a one-point contact for all matters related to incubation, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and commercialization at IIT Kanpur.",
      "",
      "SIIC was set up in collaboration with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to foster innovation, research, and entrepreneurial activities in technology-related areas. SIIC’s success is evident from the fact that so far 100+ startups are a part of their portfolio, of which around 60 have graduated. Also, around INR 100+ Crores have been invested in various ventures.",
      "There are many inspiring incubation stories at SIIC. Vox got in touch with a couple of these startups. The first one,Doorastha Analytics, is based out of Delhi and is focussed on mitigating the obstacle of sustainability in the Solar Off-Grid Systems. They have developed and prototyped a solution named iLUMY (Intelligent Laghu Urja Mapan Yantra) for measurement and monitoring of Solar Micro & Mini-grids.",
      "The founder of the startup,Mr. Atanu Mukerjeeshares his story with us,“Starting by working in the solar space and rural areas, we realized that there was a shortage of access and availability of electricity for productive purposes. We realized that most of the available solutions were CSR driven. They die out once the financer loses their focus. That is when we thought of coming up with a self-sustainable solution that not only provides electricity to the beneficiary but at the same time creates employment for 2-3 people on site. Our focus was on optimizing the operation cost. At the same time, we sought to employ data analytics to maximize the ROI for each plant.",
      "",
      "Our journey preceding contact with SIIC has been eventful. Before SIIC, we were incubated atVillgro, who is the implementation partner for the INVENT Program. Through them, we came in contact with SIIC in November 2018 when we were selected for funding and incubation support through the social incubation program, INVENT, at SIIC. The experience with SIIC has been very promising and positive. We’ve had excellent insights from the people they have networked us with. The impact and the network we have been connected to has been positive.",
      "The experience with an incubation center primarily depends on the people running it. We’ve worked with quite a few now. The very first one being government-run was very bureaucratic. More things happened on paper as compared to the impact. We even had trouble with selecting a Mentor.With SIIC, first off, we had a very great experience with our Mentor for the INVENT Program, Mr. Rishi Srivastava. He is very incisive with his views and helps us take a solid look at how we are doing. He is critical with his analysis, and he is very well connected. All this put together goes to show that it ultimately boils down to how things are run, and we’ve had a great experience with SIIC. A lot of activities are continually happening even though we are based out of Delhi. Apart from the overall funding and networking with potential investors, SIIC, through its team of portfolio managers helped to provide us with publicity and visibility in various forums and portals.We are currently looking forward to the CIVIC Tech: India 2019 for which we have been shortlisted.”",
      "“CIVIC Tech: India 2019” event was kicked off by SIIC, in collaboration withVillage CapitalandOmidyar Network, on 26th June this year. This program aimed to improve government service delivery and to increase citizen engagement for better governance.In this event, SIIC had shortlisted startups from its portfolio, among which Doorastha was one. The winners of this event will get 1:1 mentorship with sector leaders, and tailored engagements with strategic partners and investors. Participating ventures had to evaluate each other using Village Capital’s unique peer-due diligence methodology, and Village Capital explored the potential of investing in peer-selected ventures from the bunch. Omidyar Network too took the top enterprises from the program to an advanced stage for further support and potential investment.",
      "The other startup we contacted is one closer to home.Campus Haatis an online social commerce platform for college students in India founded by our alumMr. Guddu Kumar, Y10 CSE. At the time of his graduation, he felt a need for a Peer-2-Peer platform where students can freely trade (buy-sell-rent-donate) among themselves. He says, “We started with a website (www.campushaat.com), in December 2015. The traffic began to grow, and the overall response was positive. Until this point, there was no plan to expand Campus Haat into other colleges or make revenue. Things changed after a stint with Dawaibox, Mumbai (Co-founded by Vibhav Agarwal, Y10, IIT Kanpur) where I gainedconfidence and exposure to the startup atmosphere. At this time Akshat Srivastava (Y13, CHM, IIT Kanpur), who was in the final year at IIT Kanpur joined the team as a Co-Founder. After deciding to startup, we started looking for guidance and help. That’s when we got to know about SIIC through my friend Nikhil Kurele who also has his company, Nocca Robotics, incubated at SIIC. Upon contacting SIIC, we were suggested to go for theNIDHI-EIRfellowship scheme, which helps aspiring entrepreneurs to get some funds every month for one year. We already knew that SIIC gave entrepreneurs a coworking space, but we came to know that they also offered residential space, which was unique to them among all Incubators in India. But the process was unknown to most of the students at that time, including us.",
      "",
      "We got incredible support from the SIIC team, right from framing the idea and getting the right business plan to help in pitching efficiently. We were awarded maximum support assistance in EIR, and thus we planned for getting incubated here at SIIC. The Incubation process was reasonably seamless comprising only of a presentation in front of the Incubation Committee which had members from the Innovation Council of IIT Kanpur, some faculty members, some successful alumni entrepreneurs, and private investors. The only thing other than the presentation was a background check on the founders.",
      "We have applied for the HDFC CSR grant under the Community empowerment category and are waiting for the results. After successfully testing our Idea and solutions, we are ready to open our portal for the students in other colleges and are hopeful for the future.”",
      "The Smart Start-up Meet 2019 withHDFC Bankwas organized by SIIC to give a fresh perspective on the current Fin-tech and Banking needs of the country. The event welcomed a lot of new ideas for discussion. Greater importance was given to the opportunities with mass level disruption. HDFC Bank partnered with SIIC to explore opportunities to fund startups in selected areas of Sustainable development, Community empowerment, Clean/renewable energy. SIIC regularly organizes networking and pitching sessions for the entrepreneurs on the campus. Very recently, we had the Medical Technology Hackathon (22nd May to 25th May), and the Smart startUp Meet 2019 was conducted on 28th May. A lot of opportunities are also being presented through their various Venture Capitalists, Industry and Government connect.",
      "Apart from the prospects of Incubation for all Entrepreneurs and the various events conducted by the SIIC, a set of student-centric schemes have been very recently added to the cohort of opportunities available for IITK students.",
      "",
      "Not to forget, there’s also theDeferred Placement Program (DPP).",
      "SIIC boasts a highly professional team working with a committee of reputed investors of India who take the call on incubation of any business idea. Thus, an offer of incubation at SIIC is a unique stamp of approval for any business idea.",
      "Summing up with a crunchy stat cookie: ~65% of IITK graduates who got incubated at SIIC succeeded in establishing an independent enterprise. Also, for all the Bio-Tech entrepreneurs out there, the applications forBIGwith a grant-in-aid of 5 million is open now. What’s more to say? #gopitch",

      "Dr. BVR Mohan Reddy, a highly distinguished alumnus of IITK, graced the 52nd Convocation this year as the Chief Guest for the event. In times when the country was facing huge economic crises and was heading towards historical reforms, Dr. BVR Mohan Reddy started his entrepreneurial journey by founding the engineering services venture, Infotech Enterprises, in 1991. Infotech Enterprises was later rebranded as Cyient in 2014.",
      "Apart from this Dr. BVR Mohan Reddy currently serves as the Chairman of IIT Hyderabad, as the Chairman of NASSCOM’s Sector Skill Council, and several other important leadership positions. He has previously served as the Chairman of NASSCOM in India in 2015-2016.",
      "He has very recently donated Rs 1 crore towards endowment at IIT Kanpur for supporting the spirit of entrepreneurship among students.",
      "With such accolades to his name, Vox was humbled at the opportunity to interact with the pioneer on the day of convocation. Here are excerpts from the same.",
      "You were among the first generation of Entrepreneurs in India. The challenges back then must have been very different from what they are now. What were those challenges?",
      "I started my company back in 1991 with no foreign Venture Capital funds in India. There were only 2-3 Indian Venture Capitals who were keener on protecting themselves. I used to very humorously tell one of them who funded me that they were “Vulture Capitals” and not Venture Capitals. They wanted to be very safe and conservative about what they did.",
      "The second one is that the industry to which I belong to broadly called the IT industry has a superior infrastructure but in the initial days Bandwidth was rationed, we used to apply for bandwidth then wait in a queue as to who gets how much bandwidth at what point of time.",
      "Also, there was a 100% duty on imported equipment. So these were the sort of challenges we had back then, comparatively now the ease of doing business has improved. Recognition for India has improved. In the 1990s, when we went to the USA to talk to customers, India’s image had not moved past the “land of Elephants and snake-charmers” in their eyes. Now the perception is far far different. Another advantage that people now have is in terms of the enormous improvements in technology. Technology is providing an immense amount of opportunities.",
      "During your IIT days, what were those experiences which in your opinion were key in bringing you closer to the defining moments of your illustrious career?",
      "Something very special for me about this campus was that the student-faculty interaction was very very intense and positive. The faculty treated the student as a friend. I used to live in Hall-5, and to this date, I recite this to people that every Sunday in Hall-5 we had a fairly large dinner with around 40 tables in the dining hall. On every table, there’d be a faculty member invited by some student or other and these invitations were not for grades! The amount of interaction this would harbor was enormous. Part of the reason this was possible was that all of the faculties lived right here on campus. In IITH where I am the Chairman, we still do not have all of the faculties on board, so this is something that should not be taken for granted.",
      "What would be a piece of advice to an aspiring student entrepreneur?",
      "This is the best time to become an Entrepreneur. I say this because Ease of doing business has improved, Technology is at its best and Infrastructure is in place. But if you really want to become an Entrepreneur look for a real problem, do not sit in your room and decide that a particular idea will make you an Entrepreneur, it’s the wrong way to go about.",
      "Once you have identified a real problem, you should find a real solution that is distinctively different from the available solutions and that lasts for a long time. Also, the pace at which technology is advancing these days we can’t hope someone to do it all by themselves, you need proper teamwork to sustain.",
      "So, in summary, you need three things: A real problem, a distinctively different long term solution, and a good team.",

      "Disclaimer: The article contains gruesome details of the incident, hence reader’s discretion is advised.",
      "Recently, a female dog was found dead in the lower terrace of F-Block, Hall 12. The death did not seem natural, as there was a pool of blood around the victim along with rods that had blood, hair and flesh on them, pointing towards a human-committed murder.Although the time of occurrence of the barbaric act remains uncertain, Animal Welfare Cell (AWC) member, Mr. Aditya Desai, told Vox that they were informed about this on the night of 26th May, 2019. “Along with the pool around the victim, there was a trail of blood on the walls of the terrace. The rods were multiple in number and resembled table supports, and the body of the victim had multiple punctures on it, along with other fatal injuries, probably made using these rods”, Mr. Desai said. The institute veterinarian was called to the spot by AWC members for an initial examination of the body. Allegedly, injury marks and bleeding was found around the vagina of the victim, pointing towards a possible case of Animal Sexual Assault (ASA).The meeting eventually decided on conducting an internal investigation first, before handing it over to the police, and a Fact Finding Committee (FFC) was formed, headed by Prof. Ark Verma. Prof Verma, who is also the Warden of Hall 12, abstained himself from commenting on the situation until the investigation was over.",
      "",
      "The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960), being an old and obsolete law, sentences the accused with 2-3 years of prison, if found guilty. Mostly, the accused confesses and gets away with a fine, so a disciplinary action by the FFC is definitely a better shot at justice in this case.Given the brutality of the act, sources in the FFC suggest that in case one or more students are involved, they can face a serious disciplinary action, if proven guilty. Also, as several people involved in the case have pointed out, the accused person is a potential threat to overall safety of not just animals, but the human residents as well, irrespective of the fact whether the act was done under some influence (alcohol or drug) or not.",
      "The blood trails also suggest that the victim was probably cornered, and controlling a stray animal in this manner, strongly points towards this being a group act. Another possibility, that cannot be ignored, is the alleged sexual assault, which is also a punishable offence in section 377 under the IPC. This charge, which can result in sentences upto 10 years of prison, if proven, would be one of the rare barbaric cases of reported sexual offence against animals in India.",
      "With ineffective judiciary laws against animal cruelty, that are unlikely to change given the votebank-driven politics of the country, one can only hope that the FFC finds the offender and serves justice to the voiceless victim. Animal cruelty and criminal offence are strongly correlated, and the former strongly indicates psychopathic behavior, posing a grave danger to the campus.Also it is highly probable, that the act was accompanied by noises from the suffering victim. Hence Vox urges the occupants of F-Block, Hall 12 and the entire campus junta for that matter, to contact Prof. Ark Verma and share anything that they know about the incident. Incidences like these not only make us question the state of mind of people around us, but also create a need for the campus community to be sensitized towards the treatment of animals.",

      "“When I was asked by a member of Vox Populi and a long time friend to share my story with people, I had two options – whether I wish to share my story anonymously, or come out into the open. A lot of pondering, followed by a realization of the purpose for which I am at all writing this, led to me select the second option, for it was high time that my “secret” didn’t remain a secret anymore.It was tough, growing up to be someone who doesn’t entirely fall into the “common” category. It was my 10th standard, to be precise when I came to realize my sexual orientation, with much help from the internet. For the frequent ostracism faced at school due to my slightly effeminate ways of talking, sitting, or waving the hand didn’t inspire me to confide in my friends.First came denial, I don’t have to be the one I can’t be the one out of so many, to have this “problem”! With time, comes acceptance. I came to accept myself pretty soon, got past all the random negativity there was, and tried to focus on the significant things. Hence when I saw online videos of the campus culture of IIT Kanpur, and it’s the attitude of acceptance, I breathed a sigh of relief and hoped of possible freedom from ostracism again for at least the next four years.Thus it was a shock on Day one when during the wing sessions, one of my wingmates was made to recite the name of five famous female models and another told to keep a collection of porn for the wing. One might argue those were jokes and not to be taken seriously, but for me the culture of “opening up via wing sessions” was slowly becoming uncomfortable. I remember a few of my wingmates finding it hard to believe when I first came out to them about being gay. While some came up with not so innovative names for me behind my back, a few others started avoiding me. It was this once that one of them point blank asked me what the difference was between a transgender person and me. I so realized that this campus, proud of it’s open-minded and accepting the culture, amidst all its bonding and opening up sessions, could do a lot more on gender and sexuality awareness.Things weren’t very fine when I tried to step out of the wing either. I recollect asking one of my seniors about Unmukt, and they commented it’s a gay club. My student guide wasn’t so close as for me to confide in him and nearly every person I tried to express myself to left me disappointed with their response. A few would just start being hesitant to communicate after hearing my “truth”, a few others would say its perfectly okay and then behave in ways so as to clearly suggest it wasn’t, while some double standard people would just pretend to accept it and then pass demeaning remarks on a guy being effeminate or stuff like that.I appeared to have hit a rock wall. It was time to accept that the campus, with its mandatory use of cuss words as a form of endearment, was a huge heteronormative, crushing experience after all. I shut myself in my small shell of two or three nice wingmates and never interacted with anyone outside this sphere. I was so tired of people judging me all the time that I put up an act and even tried learning “masculine ways” of behaving in public. When I thought I couldn’t be more depressed, I found a way of distracting myself by reading. I started seeing my world in books. I read fiction, drama, mystery, and whatnot. Anyway, with the first semester exams knocking on the door, I could do with a bit of concentration. It was that time when I started helping my roommates with some of the courses, discussing stuff and mugging up random things the day before the exam. Strangely enough, I felt the three of us bonding over that. My class notes on MTH101 became a requirement, and those late night discussion sessions did what I had tried to do for so long. I started feeling at home in my wing; at the same time, I discovered a friend from class who was genuinely okay with my sexual orientation. I found my life getting better, a slow but gradual process, and I learnt to not care much about people’s opinion of me. I still try to educate people who want to be informed and are accepting, but I do realize some level of ignorance is always there, even in our place and time.I feel the problem with the campus mentality is not being able to accept anything that doesn’t abide by the norms set by the majority, and we, the “minority” in this case, do feel the brunt of it. I still remember going to the Music club auditions and badly wanting to run away at the last moment, for I didn’t want the femininity in my voice once I sang the high pitched part to reveal anything to the people present there. When I look at that self of mine, I really have come a long way. With this article, I guess I am letting go of all my reservations and hesitation about letting others know about my identity; for I realized not only is it about being true to yourself but also looking at life from a different perspective, “through a colored glass.”",

      "The session began by the moderators, Rupesh Chafle and Vineeth Vijayan, two responsible people from the PG community who stepped in to take the responsibility, acknowledging the fact that IIT Kanpur is increasingly becoming a postgraduate college and therefore for their security and issues the open house was organized. The Director, DoAA, DoSA, DoRD and PGARC Chairman were present on the panel.",
      "One of the first issues to be discussed was the Completion of Ph.D. MTech and MSR. Ideally, the doctorates should be contained in 5 years and MTech and MSR should be completed in their period, it will also save the resources of the institute. However, quite surprisingly, around 25%  of the crowd present were beyond 5 years into their doctorates.",
      "Students were of the view that the widespread perception among the faculty is that, since most people cannot complete their doctorates in five years, it is okay if it gets stretched for another two years. According to them, it has become a common culture. They emphasized that this ‘culture’ was at blame, and there is a need for change. They also claimed that there had been cases where the student had not gotten a single X grade but still had their Ph.D. extended and wherein MSR was also extended from 22 months to 3 to 3.5 years. Also, the students claimed that in the HSS department  coursework before the Ph.D. is not really necessary and only extends the Ph.D. They also think that comprehensive examinations in HSS only serve to waste time since the students have studied for examinations before related to the subjects in them. They felt spending another six months is useless. Besides, a lot of time is consumed in the correction of papers, the setting of workshops, and the setting of meetings.The Director responded by requesting the PGARC to try ensuring the completion of Ph.D.in at least six years and also to contain MSR and MTech in their particular period. He also suggested an analysis of the delay in Ph.D. to be done. He further advised the students to concentrate on their Doctorates instead of experimenting with other departments, which eventually results in an extension of the degree.Regarding the course work in HSS Ph.D. the DoAA claimed it to be an essential part of the doctoral itself. She also emphasized on the importance of comprehensive examination and said that work should be done to make it more relevant. “For the question is not whether the examination is relevant or not rather the question is what can be done to make it more relevant.” remarked the DoAA.",
      "",
      "The next discussion was on semester exchange programs, research related conferences, and collaboration with research industries. Regarding which the director clearly stated that in no way is the institute discouraging any of its student for any of the above if it is compatible with their doctorates in the institute. He also mentioned that if the research industry collaborates with the supervisor of the student, then there won’t be any problem, but that isn’t the case most of the time.",
      "The session further extended to the discussion about the financial help for the students. According to students if the doctorates are extended due to no fault of the student, the institute should provide financial aid.Students claimed that there had been cases where the equipment needed to complete the thesis have either broken down or have not been present at that time or a lot of time has been taken to replace them resulting into an extension of Ph.D. In a specific case of Nuclear engineering, the supervisor had left in the middle of the Ph.D., and there was no current faculty in that specialization at that time, the students had to change their specializations which led to the extension of their Ph.D.As a solution, the students proposed an idea of inter IIT collaboration where in case the current institute does not have a professor of the specialization or has left then the students can approach other IIT professors for help. The DoAA mentioned that the above idea is already in the air. The director suggested that in the cases of equipment failure, the institute can see into financial help. He further said that most of the time, the faculty continues to connect with the students here even after leaving and so, called the case of Nuclear Engineering “an unfortunate exception.”",
      "Students further put forth the problems they were facing due to lack of administration. They believed that it is unfair to the student doing research, when the supervisors do not place tender for the repair of equipment on time resulting into a huge delay or when the projects with the instruments not available are assigned to the students. They claimed that there are centers in IITK which have not been operated for years because of their broken equipment and also stated that the state of the art instrument in IIT Kanpur is only utilized from 8 AM to 5 PM in a day when the booking of this facility is made from a month earlier from all over the country. They suggested that this facility can be used 24*7 and can generate revenue from it.The Director then said that a position is being created called DEAN OF STORES AND PURCHASE, who will look into the equipment problem. The DoRD assured that the point about the facilities would be looked into by the administration. He also suggested that smaller problems like opening labs for 24 hrs should be addressed by department heads and said that a meeting would be conducted with them in this regard.",
      "The next topic of discussion was the delay in the stipend that had been started by the government and CSIR fellowship. The Director assured the students that the government given stipend that was initiated from January would be started soon. He clarified that the CSIR fellowship does not come under the institute since the money is directly sent to the students account directly. PGARC chairman remarked that this is not the first time the delay has occurred. He further mentioned that earlier when the fellowship used to be transferred through the institute if and when the delay occurred, the institute did give the money through its funds. DoAA also assured that the institute should see into the CSIR fellowship and have a talk with them and also asked the students to contact her in case there are any more delays.",
      "The students further pointed out that the number of awards that the Ph.D. can apply for during convocation are barely any. The director immediately addressed this problem, informing that this is already being looked into and assured that in another 6 to 8 months, more awards would be implemented.One of the other issues discussed was the need for a central information portal, like the SPO portal, wherein the information about openings in university and R&D institutes can be obtained. And also that the SPO should shoulder the responsibility for inviting R&D and industrial research. Director conveyed that a post of CAREER DEVELOPMENT OFFICER is being made the same as DPC for Ph.D. students.",
      "Students further expressed that they want the authorities to look into the point that the supervisors want their student to write the technical reports of equipment in the lab.Also, the fact that if the student supervisor relation breaks down, the career of the student goes into a dump. Director responded by saying that the work given to the students by the supervisors other than the thesis should be taken as work for the greater good of the lab. He further remarked that the relationship between supervisor and student should be based on trust and the entire PG system should be based on familial bonds. Adding on he said, as long as the work is not too personal and is related to lab work, it can be treated as professional. The DoAA then told that in extreme cases of student and supervisor relation break down; the student can approach DoAA or else it is better for both the parties to come to a middle ground on their own.",
      "Students further conveyed that being given the tutor and TA duties during the 4th and 5th year pressurizes the student, and the allotment of TA and Tutor duties to the same people seems unfair. The PGARC chairman replied by saying that it is a volunteer activity, and most of the time there are not many students who are ready to volunteer, and therefore the duty falls to the same students time and again. He further said that the professor has the choice on whom to make the tutor, which cannot be questioned. DoAA also assured that the pressure on 4th and 5th year students because of the duties would be looked into and most probably only the 3rd year will be allotted the responsibilities.",
      "Further students claimed that the waiting list of SBRA is as long as 79 members and suggested an alternate allotment place perhaps a new hostel. The DoSA mentioned that last year 15 quarters were issued from type2 and CBWD and this year 15 more will be allocated, but a new SBRA hostel is not possible as of now. Director further added that a new SBRA hostel is not in the cards as a new 3000 seater hostel and new lecture hall facilities along with a place for staying for the new faculty is already being made. He clarified that all of this construction is part of the 300 crore loan and the government has only given 64 crore package for this.",
      "Several students raised their concerns about security on campus. It was brought to public attention that their need to be increased security near the NWTF and other remote laboratory areas (places that are far away from the center of the IITK). The DoSA immediately addressed this issue and assured that firm actions would be taken to improve this situation.",
      "Many students from the community expressed the need for a common platform for information bulletin and communication between the professors and students. The DoAA said that all the major organization releases their minutes and agendas for all meetings. Further adding to it the PG-ARC chairman said that all the organizations consist of student representatives who should make the best use of that opportunity and make sure that facilities given to students are not underutilized.",
      "Some students raised concerns about their privacy intrusion by the administration. They feel exploited due to constant policing. The director remarked that those measures were taken keeping in mind the recent security breaches in IITK. He added that it could be seen that this policing does not make anyone feel alienated and is done as nicely as possible.",
      "The popular opinion among the PG community was then summarised by one of the students. One thing pointed out was that the problem of infrastructure was not openly discussed. If an instrument is not working, it takes 7 to 8 months for being replaced, but the impact on a student is immediate, which results in negativity. The point made was that the opinions of Ph.D. in the ’90s and ’80s are different from those of Ph.D. today. Even though most problems do not have a general solution, it is a part of a full-blown crisis. He felt that the students are powerless in front of a mess and therefore, the doubt and distrust between the institute and students. It was emphasized that this distrust is resulting in a negative outlook that warns others not to do their Ph.D. here if possible.",

      "Amidst the herd with narrowing vision and mediocre ambitions, there you are, with a flicker of light still alive in your eyes. But upfront approaches a storm, threatening to blow out the last of your flame.",
      "What do you do?",
      "You grip the nearest tree, or its next-nearest neighbor and do not let go.",
      "",
      "Well, this is what has been happening in the “gusty” placement season so far. Under numerous pressures, whether it be from the peer group, family or fear of doing something offbeat; students often look away from their own goals and settle for a 9-5 routine. In the times of ever so bustling entrepreneurship activity, if our ambition is snuffed out in such a facile manner then we cannot expect to produce leaders or even thinkers for that matter from our ranks.",
      "This is the problem that the newly instatedDeferred Placement Programmeaims to curb. The DPP was proposed by Mr. Pratyush Rai, President Students’ Gymkhana ‘18-19 towards the end of August’18.",
      "IIT Kanpur has the potential to give great technical and non-technical startups to the nation. But many students take up jobs because of the responsibilities or pressure from their family to go for a decent job, to settle as soon as possible. DPP allows the students to defer their placement season up to a couple of years later. These couple of years can be utilized by students to focus their time and efforts completely on their ventures with no academic pressure of any sort.",
      "Mr. Mayank Chauhan, ex-Overall Coordinator E-Cell opines,“As the number of entrepreneurial ventures increases in the campus, it is not practical to cater to these startups on a case to case basis, we rather need sustainable institutional frameworks which facilitate the campus entrepreneurs.”",
      "The decision of not sitting in the placements is huge for a student. With the DPP, they will have a backup plan in case their startup doesn’t take off. Mayank concurs, “Such a support system would ensure that in this protected environment, people get the opportunity to take their first step towards entrepreneurship. Also, it makes them capable of making more informed choices about their future.”",
      "The details of the procedure for applying are yet to be finalized in consultation with the SPO Chair.",
      "A point in the DPP policy that demands thought is the proposal of “freezing” the CV of candidates as it were during their penultimate semester for the purpose of sending to potential recruiters by the SPO office. Pratyush added that the policy was included after due deliberation and consideration of similar programs in IIMs. This particular policy though seems to be conservative, but it does not mean that the experience and skills of the candidates acquired during their startup stint will be thrown under the rug. The DPP candidates will be applying as “Alumni” in the placements, thus distinguishing them from the regular students. This can also be thought of as a check for the sincerity of the participants.",
      "What if the motivated students got to have a stint with entrepreneurship, as an official institute run program, well before the final “reckoning” that the placements are? EnterSummer Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Programme,this is another gem in the pipeline.",
      "Just as SURGE has complemented the opportunities for students interested in the field of Research right from their second year, SUEP aims to do that for students interested in the field of Entrepreneurship.",
      "SUEP was proposed in the first week of Feb’19 by Mr. Pratyush Rai(ex-President Students’ Gymkhana), Mr. Mukund Maheshwari (ex Overall Coordinator, E-Cell) and Mr. Tanay Anand (ex-Head, E-Cell) and was accepted by the committee as proposed.",
      "SUEP will allow students who have completed their 4th semester to invest their summer break into their own start-up and hopefully build up their own businesses. Nurturing the flair of entrepreneurship right from such an early stage gives students a head start into their careers. Since the program has a proper supervisory and guidance structure in place, the students have a support system while also having freedom. The students will also be provided a stipend for the duration of the program. The program also enables students to explore their entrepreneurial interests and decide for themselves. This is good not just for them but also for the institute.",
      "Mr. Rhythm Pathak, Officiating President Students’ Gymkhana, briefs,“SUEP will be implemented from next summer onwards. The program is important to nurture the spirit of Entrepreneurship in students from an early stage so that they can see this as a career option and pursue it.”",
      "Mr. Tanay Anand adds,“Building a product from scratch to making its business plan and maybe testing it in the market is one of the best ways you can spend your summers. It is different from other projects because you try out every innovation you can think of in your product.”",
      "Addressing the problem of expedient attitude wide-spread in the junta he further added, “This program would really be beneficial if the students continue working on their startup even after summers and not just use it as a point in their resume.”",
      "A notable recommendation by the committee is that the members of the team who wish to continue to work on their venture after the summer recess shall have to furnish an undertaking stating that she/he will not cite participation in this program as a reason of poor academic performance.",
      "The proceedings of the program have already been finalized.",
      "",
      "",
      "The evaluation will be done in two phases after an initial screening of the students done by a committee appointed by SIIC. While the panel for mid-term evaluation will consist of members from AA and Professors appointed by the institute, the final evaluation committee will be even more diverse. It will consist of Venture Capitalists, Serial Entrepreneurs, Angel Investors, Startup Mentors, etc.",
      "With the addition of such great initiatives to support aspiring entrepreneurs on campus, the mantle is now upon the students to make the most out of these opportunities. As both of these programs will be implemented for the first time, it is essential to have a positive outlook towards them. That being said, it will be the responsibility of the students, especially the participants, to provide necessary feedback to make these programs an essential part of the entrepreneurial identity of the campus.",

      "As has been the precedent, students from our institute got selected for the prestigious Google Summer of Code 2019. Vox congratulates the selected students on their well-deserved success. The number of selections from our institute continues to be impressive, as has been the trend over the past three installments of the program",
      "",
      "",
      "GSoC is a global program by Google for university students to learn about and get involved in open source. It is a unique program where students are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real-world open source project during their summer break.  Projects cover a wide range of fields including Cloud, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, Programming Languages, Robotics, Science, Security and many more.",
      "There is a lot of buzz surrounding the program, but this buzz is not translated into selections as a lot of students do not complete the application process due to issues like lack of information or starting late. We talked to the Coordinator of Programming Club, Mr. Yugesh Kothari, who got selected for GSoC’18. He gave valuable bits of advice for the prospective students and shares useful insights about the application process.",
      "The timeline of the program can be broken down in three phases: contribution, application and project work. Typically, Google releases a list of selected organizations sometime in mid to late February, which follows a month-long period where these selected organizations release their list of project ideas and mentors for each project. Students start to interact with the mentors to understand the project, make code contributions and interact with the community., concluding the first phase.",
      "The second phase has the all-important drafting of proposals where candidates outline their understanding of the project, suggest a plan of action and a tentative timeline highlighting how they plan to execute the project over three months. The proposal holds a significant weight in shortlisting candidates, along with their interactions with the mentor, their dedication to contribute, their availability and their code contributions.",
      "Once the application phase is over, the selected organizations work with Google to decide on the number of slots each organization should get. Every organization is allocated some spots which they assign to projects they deem necessary. Based on the contribution, organizations then shortlist students for the selected projects. The allocation is not as simple as it sounds.  Yugesh added,“There is a lot of subjectivity in the application process and a lot of luck involved. It may so happen that the project you applied for may not get selected at all. So even though you put in a proposal and were fit to work on it, you may not get selected.”",
      "This allocation marks the beginning of the third phase which lasts the whole summer. Throughout the program, Google assumes a reviewal role for the companies and their needs.",
      "We conclude with some pointers and tips to keep in mind while applying:",
      "At the very least you will learn something. Open Source is a testament of the fact that developers sitting across the globe writing code in their spare time can develop and maintain software such as Linux.",
      "Even though you are not sure of this year’s organizations, you know all of last year’s stats. There’s a good chance those organizations will come again.",
      "Both around you and in the organization. The Open Source community is built on these principles, and you will find that people are constructive and supportive.",
      "Once the organization list and project ideas are out (mid to late Feb) the following can be a comprehensive checklist for your application:",
      "#Pick organizations/project ideas you like.",
      "#See if the mentor has listed some project tasks.",
      "#Check the code base and see the bug tracker for issues.",
      "#Setup software locally and try it out. Read the contributing.md file. Most organizations have dedicated pages for new contributors and also have new-comer-issues.",
      "#Introduce yourself to the mentors and be in constant touch with them.",
      "#Solve a few issues; 2-3 are good enough.",
      "#Target at least 2 organizations parallelly.",
      "#Write a proposal and get it reviewed by mentors. Your proposal:",
      "-Should reflect your understanding of the project",
      "-Should reflect your understanding of the technologies",
      "",
      "You can visit the GitHub profiles of the selected organizations for greater insight into their specific domains of work and how they go about them.",

      "Disclaimer: This is an opinion piece by Ms Archana Singh on the current state of electoral politics on campus. The facts and statements mentioned in this article are based on her interactions with current students and recent alumni on campus.",
      "The 2019 Gymkhana Elections witnessed a series of electoral malpractices. The violations by candidates included mass phone calls to students on voting day, attempts to garner votes on community lines, usage of official machinery for electoral gains and collusion among the candidates.",
      "When the violations were brought forth, a complaint was filed with the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC). The GRC is a five-membered committee, comprising three student and two faculty members, that looks into any concerns related to an election that is raised before it. The committee acted upon the complaint filed and collected evidence to conduct a detailed investigation. Four weeks after the complaint was filed, the GRC took several strong actions, most notably cancelling the elections for the post of President Student’s Gymkhana and General Secretary, Media and Culture.",
      "The violations were serious. But they are not new. “Such incidents occur every election and nullification of election results and candidature have taken place in previous elections as well”, says Ayush Pathak, who served as the Chief Election Officer in 2016-17 and who has closely witnessed five General Elections.",
      "Elections to the student bodies ideally ought to be a healthy contest of ideas and visions that provide popular representation to the student community and improve their lives on the campus. Malpractices of the sort witnessed this election turn candidates’ attention away from real issues. The manifesto, which is supposed to be the focus of the campaign, faces the risk of being reduced to a mere formality. A vicious cycle has been set up that either compels well-meaning candidates to drift away from ethical conduct to stay in the race; or causes people to refrain from taking part in the democratic process altogether. This has been witnessed in the past few elections where positions are either won uncontested, or the contests frequently take an ugly turn.",
      "Top offices in the Students’ Gymkhana are very lucrative posts. Candidates aspiring to occupy these positions start their preparations many months in advance. “Executive Posts in the Gymkhana bring with them the power to create an impact on campus. They are also seen as a status symbol and add great value to one’s resume”, adds Amit Ranjan, a Y14 alumnus and Institute Leadership Awardee. The desire to get ahead of one’s rivals and win the election makes candidates willing to gain advantages by sacrificing their commitment to the code of conduct. Votes are sought and cast on the basis of “hall feelings”. HEC members participate in such measures to ensure that they get support from the Gymkhana. Some even do so to improve their own political prospects. Candidates also cater to voting blocs that exist on clubs sports teams and even community grounds. Identities end up taking precedence over issues.",
      "The lack of attention given to pertinent issues during the election campaign carries forward into governance. “The Students’ Senate takes up issues which are relevant only to a limited number of people on campus. It spends most of its time discussing fests like Antaragni, Techkriti and events like E-Summit and General Championships. Issues related to student welfare are relegated to the back seat”, opines Aditya Desai, a two-term PhD Y14 senator.",
      "Post Graduate students, who make about half of the student population on campus, feel their issues are neglected and find participating in the student body futile. A resident of Hall XI, who did not wish to be named, shares his account: “The Gymkhana hasn’t been able to resolve the crisis in Hall XI for the past two years. The hall has been running without a constitution since its inception and there is a continuous conflict between the Hall Wardens and the residents”.",
      "There is an air of dissatisfaction among the undergraduate students with the way things function within the system. “I vote in every election but mostly for NOTA. People are occupying posts only for narrow self-interests. They take up a position only to use it as a stepping stone to a higher position, neglecting their current responsibilities. It’s not the most competent, but the most politically willing people that end up in the Senate and the Gymkhana. Awards and appointment to committees are decided on the basis of networks and connections. Vox too has failed in holding student representatives accountable and that has also contributed to the state of affairs.”, fiercely argues Sayash Kapoor, a final-year undergraduate student.",
      "On the issue of participation of girls in the elections, Mugdha Arora, a candidate for the post of General Secretary, Games and Sports in the 2018 Elections, says, “As an institution, we do not groom girls to make viable candidates. While boys can openly display ambitions and get mentorship and exposure from their seniors, girls are unable to even aspire to get into leadership positions as they lack a similar support structure.”",
      "In 2019, we complete 60 years as an institute. At this critical juncture, we as a student body must pause, introspect and correct course. IIT Kanpur is celebrated for the voice and freedom it offers to its students. Credible student leadership is vital to the survival of this freedom. Resolutions passed by the Students’ Senate carry weight in front of institute authorities. The Students’ Senate’s nominees to institute committees play an important role in putting forth the voices of the student community. Student representatives having the confidence of the General Student Body is necessary for them to be taken seriously by the administration. The current state of affairs, in which we are drifting away from principles that lie at the core of student governance, endanger the very freedoms we so cherish. We, as a student community, must get our act together before the administration starts questioning our ability to be responsible and finds a reason to dilute our say on crucial issues concerning us.",

      "Recently, a new council was formulated and incorporated in the Student’s Gymkhana, the “Academic and Career Council.” The formation of this Council is one of the notable steps the Students’ Gymkhana has taken during this tenure. This was not the first time when a proposal for a council related to academics had come, discussions were in progress for a long time. Both academics and other career opportunities are important prospects to the campus community, the incorporation of these in the form of a dedicated council can be understood.",
      "As stated in the AnC Council’s proposal of formation “Various models for Academics and related affairs have been tried by the Gymkhana in the past years but none of them have proved effective, in the long term”. The formation of Academics and Career Cell, which is now in its 3rd year since formation, was one such initiative which too was not very effective because of its low reach among the students and ambiguous distribution of responsibility among the cell members. The proposal for the AnC Council mentioned that “Cells themselves are relatively new entities and their powers are highly ambiguous in many scenarios. The Overall Coordinators not being elected representatives face several issues while working with various institute authorities and often end up routing them through the President or Chairperson, Students’ Senate. Similarly, although they are expected to work with the student nominees to DUGCs, SUGCs and other academic subcommittees, their control over them is ambiguous.” For the formulation and execution of long term objectives, the need for a more centralized body can be understood.",
      "The structure of the council as proposed in the Senate. The council will be headed by 2 Executives, a UG Secretary and a PG secretary for the respective communities. There will be five major wings under it namely,",
      "The President Student’s Gymkhana, Chairperson (Students’ Senate) and Nominees from Institute academic committees – including the Senate level (SUGC, SPGC, SCDMC, SEPC) as well as the Dept. level (DUGC, DPGC) subcommittees will also be a part of the council.",
      "Formation of a council with the focus on Career awareness and development of students intends to achieve an improvement in this regard. It aims to bring all aspects of the career needs of the students under one umbrella. Along with this, the council would overlook the functioning of the Career Development Cell, which in its present state, as stated in the proposal, “Has largely been dormant apart from a few individualistic efforts which were observed with some support of the existing bodies”.",
      "Career aspect of AnC Council and integration of SPO with the Council:",
      "It has been observed that while preparing for internships and placements, students generally face two crucial issues: unawareness of career avenues and lack of interpersonal and soft skills. Or more generally there are three major issues that will be targeted:",
      "Career Awareness is related to making the students aware of the various career opportunities which are available for them as per the skill sets they have. Career Development/ Training, meant to enhance the skill sets of students according to the needs and according to the career they want to get into. And lastly, Career Opportunities aimed to bring career opportunities for the students through companies, research platforms etc.",
      "With this idea of collaborating all the three aspects of career, Mr. Pratyush Rai, President Students’ Gymkhana came up with a proposal in the 5th Students’ Senate Meeting (Special) for integration of SPO under the ambit of Student’s Gymkhana. The proposal is to bring SPO and Academic and Career Council together in a collaboration. The motivation behind this collaboration is to initiate a dialogue between the Gymkhana and the SPO. Mr. Pratyush Rai mentioned, “SPO handles the career opportunities aspect. Since all three aspects of a career are interconnected, they need to collaborate in terms of organization of career development activities and the conduction of the core placements. This collaboration will increase the accountability of SPO ( A body which currently works independently of Students’ Gymkhana) to the students and create avenues for the general body for communication of their concerns in a direct and transparent manner.”",
      "The work horizon of the council is very wide and diverse. Thus in its initial phase, improvements and changes can be expected. Some ideas still in discussions include Industrial Collaboration, Preparatory Support for UPSC aspirants, Career Mentorship Programme etc.",
      "As its first secretaries, Mr. Rahul Sethi (U.G. Secretary) and Mr. Arun Kumar (P.G. Secretary) have a great responsibility marching forward as their efforts will pave the way for the future of this Council. The formation of the council seems to be a step in the right direction, but still, it has a long way to go. It is hoped that this integration will catalyze the placement drive, improve the preparations of students and provide better career opportunities to the campus community.",

      "The General Elections ‘19 for various positions in the Students’ Gymkhana for the 2019-20 tenure are over and so are the unfortunate incidents that took place along with it. The voting took place on 20th January and the code of conduct for the same was enforced from 11th January. The posts for which candidates contested namely are – President, Students’ Gymkhana; General Secretaries for Media and Cultural, Science and Technology, Games and Sports Councils; UG and PG Secretaries for the Academics and Career Council, and multiple Senator positions for different programmes and batches.",
      "These elections witnessed numerous electoral malpractices and unfortunate offences, which brought the dark side of student politics in campus into the light. Vox Populi, IIT Kanpur brings you a piece about how General Elections, 2019 was harrowed and how it went on to bring forward issues no one would have imagined of. We have avoided naming people in this article. Our aim is not to start a name-blame debate, rather point out the underlying issues that made this year’s elections one of the most saddening ones in the recent past.",
      "Communal and divisive politics, a widely discussed topic in the Indian political context, cast its dark shadows on our campus. In an audio recording acquired by Vox a Presidential candidate can be heard mentioning how the assistance of a PG student of IIT Kanpur was taken in order to connect to Haryanvi, Punjabi and Odia communities. In addition, there was an attempt to tap into the votes of the Muslim community via an influential member for another Presidential candidate, the offer for which was declined by the said member. A UG Y18 student (who confided in us) was approached too, for the purpose of soliciting the support of the Marathi community.",
      "Nepotism, an act of using power (in this case a position of Students’ Gymkhana) to favour or support an individual is a violation of the code of conduct enforced by the Election Commission of Students’ Gymkhana. It paves the path for personal biases and favouritism in a democratic system like ours. According to our sources, nepotism was observed in the process of acquiring campaigners by a certain Presidential candidate. The said candidate promised positions in the Senate subcommittees and the President’s Office in exchange of support in the General Elections. Two sitting General Secretaries were also found expressing support publicly and privately for a certain Presidential Candidate and a General Secretary candidate for Games and Sports.",
      "The electoral process, unfortunately, found its way into the academic arena of IIT Kanpur as well. A certain Presidential candidate collaborated with two teaching assistants of a first year laboratory course, who in turn called up their allotted students asking them to vote for the said candidate. In a statement given to us, a Y18 said, “The TA informed me **** is contesting for presidential elections. **** has done very good work for his (the TA’s) Hall, and further asked me to vote for ****”.  Also, another General Secretary candidate for Games and Sports Council was found engaging in electoral discussions in the academic area against the Code of Conduct.",
      "The elections this year saw multiple instances where addictive substances have been offered to channelise votes in favour of some particular candidates. One of the General Secretary candidates for Games and Sports Council was found distributing cigarettes in a particular hall on the day of voting itself. A UG Y16 student reported to us that he was offered drugs in exchange of support for a certain Presidential candidate. One of the Presidential candidates was seen consuming alcohol with campaigners in the hostel premises. Despite administrative measures to tackle the problem of substance abuse including the establishment of the Deaddiction Clinic, the unholy nexus of student elections with these substances throws everything in a jeopardy.",
      "The extent to which propaganda politics was involved this year was really unfortunate, and for Y18 students to be the face of it all is pitiful. When the names of first year students come up in cases involving liquor, drugs distribution and power politics, a natural question of what went wrong comes up to our mind. Is it the misguidance or the hunger of power that the stakeholders of Gymkhana propagate?",
      "An incoming Y18 UG Senator provided certain undue favours to garner support for a Presidential candidate. The said person offered support to another batchmate for future elections to the HEC positions of a particular hall. In addition, the person influenced the hall allocation policy during winters where certain influential hall members were provided single rooms whereas other residents were stuffed into four per room. Another rumour that did rounds during the election period was the distribution of alcohol in some first year wings. The Y18 who was rumoured to be the one distributing alcohol told us, “Mujhe jitne leads mile unhe traceback krne pe do hi naam saamne aye, yeh do Y18 doosre presidential candidate ko support kar rhe the and main doosre ko. Yeh poora propaganda sirf mujhe aur jise mai support kar raha unhe defame karne ke liye failaya gaya tha.”",
      "Booth capturing is a word heard often in the context of Indian politics and sadly, IIT Kanpur witnessed an attempt to do the same. A sympathiser of a candidate for General Secretary, Media and Culture attempted to convince an Election Officer in Hall 5 to leave the polling station assigned and allow him to carry out the polling procedure.",
      "",
      "Image Credits – A Beautiful Mind (2001)",
      "Besides these, some other electoral malpractices which we found were as follows:",
      "i) The posts of Y18 UG senators weren’t up for voting this year because the number of candidates was equal to the number of required positions. In this context, an incoming Y18 Senator tried to convince another incoming Y18 Senator to divert all campaigners towards canvassing for a presidential candidate.",
      "ii) A supporter of one of the candidates for General Secretary, Media and Culture had a list of contacts including previous project group members and called them up to solicit votes on the night before voting.",
      "iii) An incoming Y17 senator insisted wing mates and other batchmates to go and vote for certain Presidential and General Secretary Candidates on the day of voting.",
      "iv) Two Presidential candidates were found engaging in electoral discussions with other candidates.",
      "v) An incoming Y16 Senator summoned students of entire wings of a certain Hall of residence and tried to coax them into campaigning for a candidate for General Secretary, Media and Culture, who was also present at the venue.",
      "Also, in a freak incident on the morning of 18th January, a sitting General Secretary engaged in acts of vandalism, enraged at the chance of the verdict of the Grievance Redressal Committee going against his expectations. (The meeting began at 9:30 PM on 17th January and continued till 4:30 AM in the morning). He smashed the glass panel of the notice board outside the office of the Dean of Students’ Affairs and flung the cycles of the student members of the committee.",
      "One of the members of the GRC said- “I really felt blank for a while and then unsafe. I did not know what to expect next from a person who had already smashed the glass of the Notice Board near the DoSA office and damaged our cycles. Some of us were shivering out of the fear of being harmed by him. One of us called the SIS office from the Academic Area main gate expressing our concerns to which they replied, “Hamari gadiyan ghumti rehti hain, jawan tainat hain. Aap jake room pe sojaiye.” They also asked the details of the caller and whereabouts of ***. We thought it was not safe to return to our rooms and slept at a common place outside our hostels. We have been doing this voluntarily out of our sense of dedication to the campus. If our personal security isn’t being guaranteed by the institute, why should we do anything at all? I would not have had any fear revealing my identity, but I do not have the sense of security in this campus that I used to have before Thursday. Although, I have been ensured by the authorities that action will be taken, I want the student community to know of it.”",
      "The list of charges imposed by the Election Commission and the corresponding fines can be foundhere. The Code of Conduct can be foundhere.",
      "The presence of room for activities ranging from bribery, nepotism, power play to a form of booth capturing to subvert due democratic process at every stage of election procedure entrap us more into the bubble of ignorance. Our electoral integrity is under danger and this is the time we realise how serious that is. What is sad is that these practices involve people who decide the future of this institute, who have a responsibility to take adequate steps towards progress and not of converting personal interests and grudges into a shared opinion. Distribution based on communities, substance abuse, threats, lack of transparency in the electoral framework, executive interference, and constant ways to abuse and mend rules is something that is never going to help the institute improve or the Gymkhana take constructive changes. We feel very sad, as the journalistic body of the institute, to inform you all of something like this, and hope that eventually, the message and the intensity of this unfortunate time reaches you all.",
      "Note: This article is an outcome of an effort of investigative journalism carried out by some members of Vox Populi. The reports of such incidents have not been formally shared with us by anybody or committee of the Students’ Gymkhana. This, being a journalistic effort, should not be regarded as a judicial document. Reporting has been done to the best of the abilities of the Vox Populi team. Readers are requested to note this before making any further judgements.",

    "title": "Review: Merger of Cultural Council and Films & Media Council",

      "–",
      "The Media and Cultural Council as we now know it was born out of a merger between the Cultural Council and the Films and Media Council, nearly 2 years ago on a trial basis. The decision was taken by the Students’ Senate on recommendations of the GRC (Gymkhana Review Committee) back in the winter semester of 2016-17. As the second semester of the year 2018-19 kicked in, a review of this trial merger was long due. A report finding the merger satisfactory was submitted by the Merger Review Committee constituted by The Students’ Senate. The senate thus decided to continue with this merger. So, what were the reasons and ideology behind the merger? How did the merger affect the Gymkhana in the first place? Vox brings to you a detailed analysis of the merger, its ideologies, effects and what lies in the future.",
      "One of the key arguments that supported the merger of the two councils back in March 2017 was that a common council will assist in collaborative activities. A merged council would, in the words of the GRC, “widen their(the councils’) reach as well as broaden the horizon of learning for all general body members. Ultimately, this will lead to a holistic environment with fresh enthusiasm for the Gymkhana as a whole.”",
      "Vedant Goenka (Chairperson, Students’ Senate, 2016-17) mentioned that content creators are present in the Cultural Council while content publishers are present in the Films and Media Council. Ashutosh Ranka (President, Students’ Gymkhana, 2016-17) supported his point by stating that collaborations between clubs might produce a gem. The reasons stated for this increase in collaborations were twofold, firstly increased ease of resource sharing and secondly a decrease in conflicts of interest fostered by a sense of belonging to the same council. Moreover, a significant fraction of student representatives around the time of the merger, considered that the two councils and their administration were not too different and that a single merged entity might lead to improved efficiency and accountability. The above mentioned arguments coupled with the growing belief that the gymkhana needed to change to adapt to the transforming interests and needs of the student community led to the decision of merging the 2 councils on a trial run till the end of 2018-19/I semester.",
      "While the reasons stated do seem rational and exciting, nonetheless, the “spike” in the number of collaborations that was anticipated following the merger has not been actualized. Swapnil Kumar (the first General Secretary of the Media and Cultural Council, 2017-18) believed it was due to lack of clarity in the mission or goals of the merged council that had to be accomplished at the ground level.",
      "A particular and sole example of successful collaboration is that of ELS and Films Club which led to the initiation of Open Mics on campus. Though it is believed that the role of the Films Club was limited to sharing of resources with ELS, while everything else was from the side of ELS. This surely cannot be the sort of “gem” from collaborations that the pro-merger people had anticipated. At the same time,  ELS Coordinator Karan Jha agreed that though the resource sharing within the clubs has eased out, yet any magnificent utilization of this ease has not happened. Nishant Shukla, former Photography Club Coordinator expressed his concern regarding the large number of clubs that are a part of the Media and Cultural Council – “Ambitious initiatives coming from any of the 14 clubs would find it very difficult to get implemented under the leadership of an overburdened GenSec. Montage Film Festival, an event organized by FMC was scrapped.  A “New Movie Screening” project that was ideated as well as approved was never implemented. Photography Club Exhibitions that used to be held two times every year, were also scrapped for similar reasons.”",
      "",
      "A centralised publicity wing is another one of the more subtle advantages that the Merger was supposed to incur. One of the suggestions to achieve this was to merge the Facebook Pages of the two councils. With the expectation that “The new page will have a greater reach than the currently existing pages of the separate councils”, as quoted in the GRC report. But, with the majority of the audience of both the original pages being essentially the same, the outcome expected was inadequately envisioned. Also, no significant developments have been made to establish a robust publicity wing. Swapnil Kumar shared with us what he realized during his tenure- “All the media and cultural clubs have a particular way of working that they have gotten used to over time. While in cultural clubs there is minimum involvement of the GenSec, the GenSec has a lot more say in the planning and working of the FMC clubs.” It is broadly observed that the films and media clubs are still evolving and need proper guidance from a fourth yearite, and thus are more dependent on their GenSec. On the other hand, the Cultural Council GenSec has more administrative duties. It is contrary to the belief that ‘General Secretary, Films and Media’ and ‘General Secretary, Cultural Affairs’ dispense similar duties.",
      "Various concerns were raised, the gravest of them being the possibility that Films and Media may lose its identity as a separate art form. Rhythm Pathak, The coordinator, Film’s Club said that, “Since people are less acquainted with the activities associated with the FMC (since school times), FMC required an incubation period when it was in infancy (first half of this decade). FMC was undermined by criticism while it was still struggling to grow.” Regarding the point about collaborations Rhythm added that, “collaborations are a necessity for FMC they will have to happen in the presence or absence of a merger so the point regarding collaborations in favor of merger seems redundant.”",
      "The merger unarguably has been one of the biggest changes to the structure of the Gymkhana in recent times. The people who have a pro-merger stance may say that the merger needs to be given more time, that one and a half year were not enough for the positive effects to pan out. But what is supposed to change over the course of, say another one and a half year? The on-ground goals and expectations from the merger should be clearly defined. The need of proper mentorship to evolve FMC clubs should be acknowledged and hence relevant structural changes in the core team of the Media and Cultural Council should be made. And maybe then we can get the ‘gem’ that we dreamt of 2 years ago.",

      "Disclaimer: The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general.",
      "IITK had to wait for 49 years to clinch it’s first Inter-IIT General Championship when history took a turn, and we claimed the trophy in 2013 at IIT Guwahati, followed by two more championship wins in 2014 and 2016 (The 2015 edition was called off due to incessant rain and subsequent flooding in Chennai). We fulfilled our motto of #3BaarLagataar, and our grip over General Championship increased year after year with the rising victory margin every time. From nowhere in the competition before, we rocketed to such dazzling performances in 4-5 years which made everyone wonder what conspired in this span to make IITK the best amongst the equals?",
      "Our success was based on the investment of time and energy of the sports enthusiasts, Directors and Deans, numerous other faculty members, gymkhana, coaching staff and of course, the participants. We raced ahead of other IITs as we went forward with full-time coaching staffs for all the sports disciplines and the investment in the development of the sports culture based on love for the sport, hard work, desire to achieve paid off with desirable results.",
      "In 52nd Inter IIT Sports Meet at IIT Madras, 2017, we started our campaign as hot favourites, but as the tournament progressed, our victory chariot was checked, with an end to our winning streak. A little introspection did go into the failure, but no major, organised attempt to scrutinise the shortcomings was made. The few defeats that we faced were close enough to make many believe that our loss may be a fluke and we will rise stronger in 2018. However, that was not the case, and in contrast to our expectations, we were handed a thrashing in Guwahati. The results were as miserable as they could be, and we finished the meet at 6th position in the points tally.",
      "So how come in a narrow span of 2 years our performance fell so miserably? The result is merely a reflection of our wrong decisions of the past, training, culture, and leadership. The defeat has surfaced our flaws in the handling of our human and physical resources, along with showing us the signs of our declining culture. Other institutes caught up with our formula of hiring specialised coaches around 2015-16. Following this similar system, if other institutes are getting ahead of us, the issue raises eyebrows towards competency and dedication of the training system and the lacking innovations and discipline. The coaches employ different mechanisms to hide their flaws, few of which are interfering in the Captain appointment process to select those who would be inclined towards them and assuming a sacrosanct status in the team so that students do not even think to complain.",
      "Moreover, there is a sense of utter disbelief within the sports community regarding the attitude of certain coaches towards their sport. Take, for example, a senior member of the Volleyball team mentions what their coach said to them after losing the quarterfinal match, “Mujhe to pata tha tum log ya to league se bahar ho jaoge. Ya at the max, quarter tak pahunchoge, usse zyada to kya hi jaoge.” This is a sheer disrespect of more than twenty players, who have dedicated long practice hours throughout the year, and is against the spirit of sportsmanship. Most of the members of the Lawn Tennis team mention that the coach is a major cause of their miserable performance, as he never arranged practice matches, never tried to teach them new skills, and in some cases, he didn’t even know their game style. Many members of the team feel that, if the attitude of the coach doesn’t change, they will leave playing lawn tennis.",
      "The story is the same for many other disciplines. Many Table Tennis players have complained regarding the purchase of racquets from the coach, amounting up to as large as 9000 INR per racquet, with some of them have never received the racquets after making the payment. Majority of the Hockey team members feel that, despite dedicating lots of time, they were incompetent at the platform of Inter IIT as they were never taught the skills that other teams possessed, and due to the stunted skill development, players are distancing themselves from the sport.",
      "A sportsperson at IITK dedicates an average of 2-3 hours per day training under the guidance of the coaches. After spending 4-5 years, a student gets out of the campus, having learnt a little. The PE 101 and PE 102 courses, which were designed keeping in mind the importance of physical education in the overall development of a student,  are reducing to an attendance taking exercise. Inter-IIT performance is what the coaches have reduced their job to, and despite this, we have had dismal performances. Take for example, in Table Tennis, both men’s and women’s team have not been into semi-finals of the past four Inter IITs. Hockey, Volleyball Men, Athletics Women, Lawn Tennis Women have had occasional and highly inconsistent performances. On the other hand, teams like Weightlifting, Cricket, Athletics Men, and Water Polo have excelled on most occasions. When we generalise these team’s success over a few championships, we see direct indicators of the various coaches’ competence, work ethics, and attitude towards sports.",
      "These are some of the long lists of incidents, which do not point towards a healthy sporting environment. And it isn’t just the Inter IIT players who are infuriated. When the GNS Council received a review regarding CPA through online sources, it reflected unpleasant trends. Beginners, who just want to learn a particular sport, in most cases, expressed that they had been given zero to negligible attention. Alumni have voiced their dissent towards the downward slide and their emails to the Director and other relevant authorities raise our eyebrows and points towards issues of incompetency, haphazard work ethics, and financial mismanagement.",
      "Sports can add a unique dimension to each one’s life. With an expenditure of about two crores per annum, and with the availability of world-class infrastructure, we can feed the sporting desires of a much larger community and with a much higher quality of training. But, if we look at the sporting opportunities available to the general community, the situation is nasty. Most of the students seem discontented from the approach of not giving due attention if someone isn’t a probable member of the team. A large gap has been created between sports enthusiasts of the campus and the contingent. Problems like this are profoundly denting the sports culture in our campus.",
      "The lack of accountability and discipline of the coaches is eventually leading to the downfall of the culture which took years to build. The lobbying, internal politics, and non-cooperation amongst coaches of the same sport among many other factors have rendered the deserving and hard working coaches as passive and led to their social sidelining. Under all such circumstances, sports cannot thrive. There is a genuine fear that if we do not arrest the slide, we may end up being even worse than we were a decade ago. Virtues like discipline, teamwork, belongingness, which sports instil in a person are going to be underdeveloped if the will to win is being compromised, the poor results are going to be reflected in the morale and the personality of the sportspeople of IITK, and the reputation of the institute is going to be corroded in all such sporting competitions.",
      "There is a famous saying, “We cannot become what we want, by remaining what we are”, which is very much applicable to our scenario. The need of the hour is to deeply introspect and scrutinise our mistakes closely and act upon the remedies with immediate effect. We need to be determined to change, we need to step out of our comfort zone and be a bit critical, and if need be, a few harsh proposals need be taken. The administrative will is desirable here to bring about necessary reformative decisions. A few unnecessary elements are infecting the system which need to be permanently washed off without any compromise. If there are some internal issues and politics in the concerned bodies, which are denting the culture, then strong efforts must be made to resolve it.",
      "The team wise results of the past few years suggest certain definite trends, which are indicative of their work ethics, practice environment and most important of all, the competency of the trainer. Targeted remedies for each team should be applied, depending upon the statistics and the reviews. Compulsory Physical Activity, which serves as an introduction to the sports at IIT Kanpur, has to be reviewed and sincere efforts need to be made to transform it into a better platform to nurture young talents. We must also look forward to spreading sports to a wider community of students at the campus. Many a time, it has been found that students who are willing to learn a particular sport, just for the sake of learning are not provided with due attention. Incorporating them as a part of the sports community on the campus is very much desirable.",
      "Student leadership also has a vital role to play in the course of bringing about these changes. Gymkhana events like Josh, Inferno, Enthusia, Urja etc. must be structured to provide a pathway of giving the talented a path to the teams. The contingent leaders must envision, plan, and coordinate to reinforce disciplined and planned practice schedules are followed along with the induction of significant innovations being adapted to our situations. The team captains and senior members must be pivotal in preparing the next generation of sportspeople, enlarge their team family and create a culture wherein fellow teammates continue their sport out of passion. From top administration to the novices who are willing to learn the game, everyone has a shared responsibility, and we must play our part in consonance with the goal,  with utmost sincerity for the community which we are proudly a part of, even if it takes to be a bit critical of ourselves.",

      "IIT Kanpur hosted a cohort of international students from various countries as part of the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) civilian training programme. The programme is a bilateral effort whereby the Indian Government aims to assist international students from developing countries by inviting them to pursue training courses in various institutions in India. Citizens of 17 countries across four continents partook in the programme.",
      "In a programme that saw trainees from Trinidad & Tobago in the Caribbean to war-affected nations like Palestine learn about topics ranging from Agriculture to Journalism and English to Artificial Intelligence, Vox Populi got the opportunity to talk to Joseph Zachariah from South Sudan. Joseph Zachariah is captain in Ministry of Defence & Veteran Affairs of the youngest country in the world, the Republic of South Sudan. Captain Zachariah and his team learned about Cyber Security here at IIT Kanpur. We got the opportunity to speak to him about his experience.",
      "“We found about the programme from the Indian Embassy in Juba, South Sudan. We had to go through a selection procedure after which, we were chosen to be part of the team that traveled to Kanpur,” said Zachariah. They gained technical, theoretical and practical knowledge about identifying cyber-crimes, preventing hacking and regarding the vulnerabilities of the internet. While talking about the conditions back home, Joseph said, “As South Sudan is a very young nation that got its independence from Sudan only in 2011, it is exceptionally vulnerable to and unprepared for cyber attacks. Hence,  having a team having expertise cybersecurity is a matter of national concern for South Sudan.”",
      "Joseph was full of praise and respect for the people who made the ITEC Programme possible. “This was a fantastic experience. I have gained a lot, and the programme has exposed me to how people are moving forward. A lot of important things that I lacked knowledge of were introduced to us. These two weeks have also shaped me profoundly. I will be directly applying whatever knowledge I have acquired here in making my country safe against cyber crimes, and thus contribute towards the development and safety of my nation.” Joseph explains. Adding to it, Joseph had a humble request to make. He felt the duration of the programme was short. Though they acquired ample of new knowledge, he states that if the same set of participants are provided an opportunity and resources to gain complete expertise in the field, it has the potential to save an entire nation from a lot of external threats. Joseph also requested IIT Kanpur to take the initiative and invite these people again. He also invites IITK faculty to South Sudan.",
      "Captain Joseph was touched by the staff’s hospitality here. He mentioned that though he has two bachelors degrees and has traveled to various countries for educational programmes, he found one trait unique to the professors of IITK – patience. He said, “The professors were very friendly and solved all their doubts wholly and patiently. They did not rush and did not hesitate to extend classes well beyond the designated lecture durations. I am proud to be associated with IIT Kanpur and am grateful to IITK and the Indian Government for this initiative.”",
      "When asked about the food and general reception he got in IIT Kanpur, Captain Joseph said “There was no real problem with the food except that I found it to be pretty spicy. Less spicy food would have been easier n my stomach.” Regarding his interaction with people here, he found Indians to be helpful and kind. Recalling the interesting experiences he had, he said he was thrilled when people wanted to take selfies with him. “I would have taken nearly 200 selfies with different people. Even a lot of kids wanted to take selfies with me. People were receptive of us foreigners in here” recalls Joseph.",
      "After the training was successfully completed by participants from such diverse backgrounds, learning about different fields, one realizes the kind of impact such programmes can have. It is astounding how small effort on the part of\u001b the institute and the government is arming an entire nation in their bid to thwart threats to their nation’s security.",

      "Prof. Abhay Karandikar was appointed six months ago to serve as the Director of the institute. Joining at a very crucial juncture, it has been a challenging and exciting tenure so far for him. Vox Populi got the chance to have a conversation with Prof. Karandikar to gain an insight into his perspective and plans for the future.",
      "This is the second part of the Director’s interview. The first part can be accessedhere.",
      "What do you see as the fundamental difference between IIT Kanpur and IIT Bombay? What are some lacunae that you see in the IITK system which can be filled by learning from IITB?",
      "Fundamentally there is no difference, IITK looks the same as IITB. But, IITB being located in Mumbai does enjoy some inherent advantages. It has more industry connects and gets more visitors from the industry. This promotes an ecosystem of entrepreneurship and startups. This, in turn, leads to a greater inclination towards entrepreneurship for students in IITB than in IITK. Mumbai also has the advantage of more international visitors, people who have better International Relations and connections. IITB is also 1.5 times bigger as far as students and faculty are concerned(12,000 students in IITB, 420 faculty members in IITK vis-a-vis 700 in IITB). As a result, they have more programmes and more departments that have helped it grow and flourish.IITK has a better UG programme in terms of flexibility while the number of UG students is more or less the same. The course curriculum for UGs and the academic rules and regulations are also similar. The difference becomes apparent in the graduate programmes. IITB has more graduate programmes and more sponsored projects. This is assisted by the industry connect and international visitors. Additionally, media coverage is much better in Mumbai.Regarding improvement, we have to grow regarding improving the research that affects society and the nation. We need to get more sponsored projects and improve on our industry connects. Boosting our entrepreneurship culture and strengthening our academic curriculum at the same time will take the institute to the next level.",
      "What are the key agendas that you intend to execute during your tenure? What are some steps you have taken in your tenure till now which have created a big impact or have the potential to do so?",
      "Our focus will on improving upon our faculty hiring as the faculty base forms the backbone of any institute. They bring projects, initiatives and industry connect. We also plan to hire a greater number of Ph.D. students, bring in more projects that have the potential to impact society and fuel the startup ecosystem. Further, our alumni engagements call for improvement as the alumni relations are not as strong as they should be. We are optimistic as all the right ingredients are already here – a strong ethos of academic scholarships, 60 years of existence, strong alumni base and a strong academic programme. We were the premier institute for over 30-40 years, but changes over the last decade have enabled IITD and IITB overtake us. Nevertheless, we should be able to pull ahead now.",
      "IITD has administrative support for entrepreneurship endeavors. Students there can opt for start-up instead of the thesis. Can we do the same?",
      "Yes. We can do that, and we will look for ways to support the culture of start-ups in the institute. This is one thing that can be done.",
      "Talking of outreach, alumni of IITK have expressed their displeasure with the institute due to lack of connect with their alma mater. The same is reflected through figures of funding received from Alumni. How do you aim to resolve this? What steps can you take to ensure that IITK students take advantage of our strong alumni network?",
      "We are thinking of reaching out to our alums by reaching out to them to formalize our relations in a more structured way. We want to engage them in faculty hiring and in improving our industrial relations. Many of our alums are top corporate leaders and if they assist us in our endeavours, we will most certainly be able to realize our goals. Our alumni network can be utilized to give much more benefits than just mentorship. We need to utilize our networks and extract the maximum benefit we can.",
      "The year before the start of your tenure saw some incidents (Dismissal of VH workers from service,the \u001balleged overreach of the security section,an incident ofragging) in which distrust of certain sections of the campus community with the institute administration was reflected. To what extent do you feel the issue of loss in faith has been resolved? And what steps are you taking to ensure that all members of the \u001bcommunity positively accept the decisions in the future?",
      "Of late, the institute has been portrayed in a negative light in the media. We are considering  multiple ways to tackle this. The first step is strengthening our Media and Publication cell to improve our visibility in the print and the social media. We are also looking to appoint full time media consultants and public relations officers.",
      "I believe that the student community can also actively help in our outreach. The JEE ranking hierarchy is the result of a false perception which stems out of people having a myopic view of the UG programs. IITK provides much better campus facilities like the hostels and the sport complexes as compared to the other IITs. No other IIT has three sports fields. UG students can help by informing the JEE qualified students about the facilities available. Most of the old IITs are equally good, with each institute excelling in some areas. The perception of IITK being the premier IIT has taken a hit by the negativity spread by the media. Historically, American programmes and collaborations with MIT professors cultivated high regard for the institute. The lead with the CSE programme also strengthened our standing among other IITs. A lot of these factors do not play an integral role in the UG programme of the students. The difference becomes important in the research programmes.",
      "Are you planning on improving International relations / foreign collaborations?",
      "Yes we are planning to do so, we are planning multiple things for strengthening international relations including joint PhD programmes and creating a post for the Dean of IR, to head the office of IR which is currently headed by the associate Dean.",
      "What are some of your non-academic interests?",
      "I have a lot of non academic interests like playing badminton and reading fiction. I am enthusiastic about start-ups too. I left IIT Bombay in 2002 to work on my start-up. Even now I’m mentoring startups for my students. I have contributed towards programmes on digital empowerment in rural villagI’m also keen on implementing telecom policies which will help transform India from an importer of technology to driving force. I simply don’t find enough time to pursue these things actively, as being involved in IITK administration implies a busy schedule. I’m also unable to find time to read fiction and non fiction novels. These are the things I plan to pursue post retirement, I don’t intend to be free after this job.",

Vox Populi got the chance to have a conversation with Prof. Karandikar to gain an insight into his perspective and plans for the future.",
      "Your relation with IITK goes long back to your M.Tech. and Ph.D. here to your brother’s education as well. How do you feel about being back at your alma mater as the Director of the institute?",
      "This is a feeling of great pride, I really feel humbled and overwhelmed that I got this opportunity. I had never imagined back then that I would someday be back as the director, the thought never crossed my mind. Even after graduating I remained in touch with this place. I used to attend the conferences and the Ph.D. events and used to be a part of the selection committees; I wasn’t cut off. My perception towards the institute has changed, and I’m looking forward to working with everyone at IIT Kanpur.",
      "How have the IITs evolved and what has been the major shift associated with them?",
      "The institutes started with a strong focus on the UG program and have progressed towards strong research programs now. IIT Kanpur is one of the few IITs which have had a strong focus on research. IITs were established initially to help in tech development of the nation as was envisioned by the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.This aim, however, was not realized for the first 25 years. Advances towards this aim have become significant in the last 10-15 years. The focus has shifted towards doing research that makes a change. This reflects in the way we have a large number of PG students, almost 40% of the population in IITK and more than 50% in IITB. This change in priorities has been a major shift associated with IITs.",
      "What are the most notable changes that have transpired from your masters and Ph.D. at IITK to the start of your tenure as the director?",
      "When I was a student, it was a relatively small institute, and now it has indeed grown in all dimensions. The institute has changed and the faculty members from my time, including my advisors, are now gone or have retired. The infrastructure has improved significantly, and the number of students has expanded from 3k to 7.5k. A smaller number of students inevitably lead to a very cohesive group in the departments, and we used to have significant interactions with all the faculty members. The level of connection and interaction with my supervisor as well as all the faculty members was completely different. The personal connection and the 1-to-1 interaction is a casualty of the increase in the number of students. My return as the director of the institute poses a different role with a completely different set of responsibilities.",
      "",
      "Do you feel that there is a difference in future aspirations and expectations between students and faculties which inhibits faculty-student interaction, especially in the case of UGs?",
      "I do not feel that such a difference exists. In the IIT system, there have been a lot of UG students involved in faculty research programs. There are loads of avenues and opportunities for undergraduates to contribute. The students have the opportunity to work in summers as interns. We have a very strong SURGE program here for projects under faculties. Obviously, a very tight curriculum simply doesn’t leave too much time or leeway to manage their program satisfactorily and do research under faculties.PG students have an extended research program to work on their thesis, so they are expected to be here for a longer period. The situation is so for any university in the world, the PGs and PhDs do most of the serious research.",
      "You have held the chairmanship of the TSDSI and have been working on 5G wireless networks as a faculty in the Electrical Engineering Department of IITB. Could you elaborate on your work in TSDSI and tell us about your research in 5G?",
      "At TSDSI (Telecommunications Standards Development Society, India), we realized that India has never been able to contribute to next-generation wireless standards like 2G, 3G and the likes. We’ve only been importing the equipment and the technology, and then adopting and deploying it. Although significant telecom revolution has taken place in the country, we were still a market for vendors. We haven’t developed any cell phones or base stations or wireless equipment for telecom or any standards.",
      "The major hindrance was that India was the only top telecom country in the world which didn’t have a national standards development organization. And if you don’t have such an organization, then you simply can’t participate in international bodies like 3GPP which make the next-generation standards. It was pertinent that we needed one. Hence TSDSI, now recognized by the government of India as the SDO, became the organizational partner of 3GPP in 2014 and enabled us to contribute to 4G and 5G.",
      "What is the structure of TSDSI and what is it currently working on?",
      "TSDSI has about 45 members, comprising of all the telecom stakeholders  – all telecom operators, MNCs, equipment vendors, academia and research institutes, etc. We are making significant contributions to 5g development, e.g., a team from IITB, IIT Hyderabad, IITM made great contributions in the developments. The main focus for us is to adapt the tech to suit Indian requirements.",
      "We believe that India has different requirements as compared to other countries. For example, we need broadband connectivity which can come through wireless networks unlike in the US and other Western countries where there’s ubiquitous availability of fibers. Mobiles are primarily a mode of mobility in the Western countries unlike in India. The situation in India is entirely different; many people don’t even have a wired phone which is ubiquitous and necessary for high-speed connectivity.",
      "Additionally, we need large coverage areas for rural areas and high throughput but low mobility. In addition to that, we have to run on low power since electricity supply is not uniform, sometimes forcing us to rely on generators to run the towers. Keeping this in mind, we are developing tech and prototypes for our modified strategy, popularly known as the “Frugal 5G”. We’re also a part of the 5G testbed initiative by the Government of India. We have taken it to IEEE standards, some of the requirements have gone to ITU and 3GPP as well.",

      "The past few weeks have been very busy for the Senate Undergraduate Committee (SUGC) Convenor, all because of a serious error in the campus automation platform, Pingala, which allowed four Y17 students, despite having one fail backlog (E/F or X) in some of the IC (Institute Compulsory) first-year courses, a branch change in their preferred departments. It is clearly stated in the UG manual that, “A student may apply after her/his second semester if she/he has acquired credits (i.e., received a passing grade) for all the courses prescribed in the templates for the first year of the program, including the courses where S/X grades are awarded”, yet these students were allowed a change of branch.",
      "The issue was brought to light after a student who got a branch change due to this loophole reported the same to the Dean of Academic Affairs (DoAA). Later a review of the academic records of the four students confirmed the allegations. The four students had one fail backlog in the first year courses (as prescribed in the course template).",
      "The issue was tabled for discussion in the Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC) where a number of solutions were proposed and discussed over the course of two meetings. To further supplement the committee, additional information was collected between the meetings. An important fact that emerged from the collected information was that even if every student who applied for branch change and had at most one fail backlog course was considered for branch change, it would not change the branch change results. But it is important to note here, that this fact still does not make this case fair.",
      "",
      "Three solutions were proposed in the meetings.",
      "Solution 1:",
      "To allow the students to continue in their new branches for the rest of the program. This shall be a one-time exception and shall not be used as a precedent for future decisions.",
      "Solution 2a:",
      "Revoke the branch change and allow the students to change their registration in the current semester according to their original department.",
      "Solution 2b:",
      "Revoke the branch change and allow the students to continue in their original branches starting from the third semester. The courses undertaken in the present semester but not part of the template of the original branch would be considered as Open Electives.",
      "Solution 3:",
      "To allow the students to continue in the new branch and everyone who has a CPI greater than those of the applicants and had up to 1 backlog or failed course in the first year be allowed to switch their branches. This should be done using supernumerary seats if required, but not at the cost of the strength of the initial branch going below 55%. (which is also a rule imposed by the UG Manual).",
      "The student body is not privy to the detailed discussion of the meetings, except for the (as of now, five) student representatives. Still, the issues with the solutions proposed above are clear and can be opined upon. While the first solution clearly involves the least amount of hassle, it is visibly unfair to the others with similar academic record (one fail backlog – E/F or X) who didn’t apply for branch change as they knew (or expected) that they would not be eligible for the same.",
      "The second and third solutions do have a semblance of fairness for all concerned but it will be a logistical hassle both for the students and the corresponding departments, especially with regard to planning the upcoming semesters (although one might argue, it is a feasible adjustment as it will be merely akin to a third semester branch change which is routinely facilitated by IITK).",
      "While three out of the four Y17 students here are partly at fault for hiding information after being granted branch change in violation of the rules of the UG manual, the Pingala automation portal clearly needs to be more robust as such errors, minor though they may seem, can potentially have drastic effects on the lives of individual students.",

      "During the mid-90s the need for a targeted programme for students falling under the reserved category was felt by the IITs. The huge number of reserved seats going vacant was quoted as the primary reason. The IIT council then wrote to the government for permission to start year-long preparatory courses in the institutes and the programme came into action. This year IIT Kanpur will be hosting students from two fellow IITs for the Preparatory School programme.",
      "The programme was initiated for the SC/ST category students, but was later extended to the Person with Disability (PwD) category students in the year 2009. In the present scenario, about 30-40 students from the SC/ST/PwD category are selected from the otherwise non-qualified students. They are then tutored on intermediate level concepts in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. A course on English Language, the official medium of instruction at IITs, is also covered. The objective of this course is to prepare these students for the regular B.Tech. and Dual Degree courses. Upon successful completion of the programme, the students are eligible for admission in the regular B.Tech. / Dual Degree programmes.",
      "Thus far, this programme seems to be very noble initiative. But, it has its own set issues.",
      "Over the years a gap has been observed between the students from the Preparatory Course and the regular B Tech/Dual degree students. Though bridging this gap was the very reason for the initiation of these courses, whether or not the IITs have been able to achieve the goal is something that needs to be thought upon. An IITK student in his sophomore year, who had been through a preparatory course says, “There is a huge gap between the Prep course and the first year’s curriculum at IIT Kanpur. The curriculum of the prep courses is not very rigorous and one can easily pass the courses by simply memorizing the solution to assignment problems. But this hampers one’s ‘preparation’ for the regular course, since certain parts of the subject remain underprepared.” This lack of preparation at times translates in their performance in the regular courses in the IITs. “Had the examination been more rigorous and thorough, testing our thinking capabilities, the screening would have been better. If you’re not up to the mark for competing with the regular batch, your survival here is going to be really tough”, he adds.",
      "A common trend seen in Prep Course students is lack of understanding of Maths. This not only affects their performance in future Mathematics courses but also in courses in Physics, Chemistry and other Departmental courses that pre-require +2 mathematics. Their poor laboratory background furthers their difficulties. Much of this is because of the lack of vigour in the way these courses are covered, and more importantly perceived.",
      "A final year IITK student, who had also undergone a Prep course recalls, “We were told by our Prep Course seniors there that this course is going to be a cakewalk. They gave us fundae on how to get the minimum passing percentage. This left us with loads of free time which most of the students wasted by watching movies and playing games rather than spending time on building basic concepts that would help us in future”. He feels that if a student shows some sincerity in his or her prep course, rather than thinking about merely passing it, the course is good enough to prepare oneself to survive and even do great in the regular programme.",
      "Prof. AK Lal, ho would be the instructor of Mathematics at the Prep course says, “I would base the course entirely on NCERT books. The exams would be application based, much like JEE syllabus. This would bring these students on equal footing with the regular students.” Talking about issues with the system he says, “One of the major issues he faces in his Preparatory Course is the language barrier. Although the English Language course would prepare the students for their regular programme, but for the preparatory course itself it is very tough to find a language of instruction understood by everyone.” He further adds, “The regular programme students have an academic support system in the form of Tutorials and also the Counselling Service, people who can sit along with the students and explain problems to them in languages they understand, something which the Prep course lacks.”",
      "Another major issue that pops up is managing the lifestyle of these students. Since these students have an entirely different curriculum, it’s hard for them to mix with the campus junta. This seclusion leads to various issues. As a result, the Counselling Service this year decided to give them accomodation along with the regular Y18 batch in Hall 13 and GHT. The students now stay in groups of 3-4 in wings where Y18 have been accommodated and are also allocated SGs for emotional support. Bharat Jindal, UG Assistant Coordinator, Counselling Service, believes, “This could be a better way to avoid their complete seclusion, which was possible if they were given a separate wing, a system some of the other IITs follow.”",
      "The success of Preparatory Course, like any other programme is subject to the efforts put in by both the students and the instructors. Students in this programme come with a hope of securing a seat in IITs and have a better future, but after being admitted in the regular programmes, they end up getting caught in the ruthless paradigm of competitive courses and relative grading fighting for mere survival. The only success stories that exist here are of students who were sincere in their prep course and who viewed it as a learning opportunity rather than a one year formality before getting into IITs. The system, at this points, needs to understand the specifics of their life and make sure the purpose of these courses is realized.",

      "“I found it to be enjoyable, both as an exercise in thinking about how to design medical equipment and actually observing what goes on inside the human body. It was fun to travel with friends, have a good time along the way and meet new people”, says Sambhav Mattoo, one of seven members from IIT Kanpur who visited King George’s Medical University (KGMU) Lucknow during the last summer for a collaborative programme between the two institutes.",
      "The journey of this programme began in the first week of May 2018. KGMU Lucknow hosted the first phase of the immersion programme where a group consisting of two PhD students and five undergraduate students stayed at KGMU for fifteen days. The main aim of the clinical immersion programme was to familiarize them with the problems in the current medical system and figure out engineering solutions for them.",
      "The mentor of this programme, Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, the Professor-in-Charge (PIC) of SIIC (SIDBI Incubation and Innovation Centre) at IIT Kanpur, informed us that a similar program called ‘Stanford India Biodesign Programme’ inspired him to take such steps. One of India’s famous cardiologists and science administrator, Dr. Balram Bhargava of AIIMS New Delhi had led the programme with the purpose of channelizing India’s top technical brains to bring new technological innovations to medicine. Professor Bandyopadhyay said, “modern medicine extensively relies on sophisticated tools, the needs for which are known to the doctors but the technical know-how lies with the engineers. Therefore, such immersion programmes serve to bridge the gaps between engineers and doctors as well as medical needs and technological solution.”",
      "Background",
      "Prof. Bandyopadhyay gave an insight into the SIIC and Bio-Incubator framework and various channels of funding that support innovation at IIT Kanpur. After being set up in 2000, the SIIC matured under Prof. B.V. Phani and reached new heights under Prof. Sameer Khandekar. In 2013, Prof. Bandyopadhyay was instrumental in setting up the Bio-Incubator, within the SIIC, to specifically promote biotechnology and pharmaceuticals-related innovations. With generous funding from Government of India through BIRAC (Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council), Bio-Incubator now proudly hosts a well-equipped lab that Prof. Bandyopadhyay claims, is capable of providing 70% of the facilities available in the BSBE department of IITK. In 2017, IIT Kanpur was made one of the six prime centers for granting the Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG), a fund by the Govt. of India that can dispense funds up to Rs. 50 lacs to support innovation in biotechnology. Additional funding of two crore rupees was granted by BIRAC to IITK for creating an incubator for supporting innovations in medical technology and devices (MedTech Incubator). This funding pipeline is named the BioNest. Prof. Bandyopadhyay leveraged this fund and funds from Prof. Satyaki Roy, then the officiating PI (Principal Investigator) of the Design Innovation Centre of IITK and the support from the BSBE department to sponsor the IITK – KGMU collaborative programme.",
      "Experience of the participants",
      "Anushya Goenka, a senior undergraduate student participant, reminisces about her experiences and tells us the details of the programme:“KGMU provided us with extremely comfortable lodging at their New Guest House. On the first day, we had a long chat over lunch with Dr. Rishi Sethi, who coordinated the program at KGMU. The 15-day schedule of meetings with renowned doctors, visits to different departments and operation theatres, got us excited. One Sunday morning, we had a lovely chat over tea with Dr. Bobby Ramakant, Dr. Pooja Ramakant, and Dr. Tim France on a video call. We talked about the motivation behind the program. They talked about their newly developed SDGi search engine. Over the next few days, we visited the operation theatres of Endocrinology, Neurology, Cardiology, Urology and Plastic Surgery departments. At the Endocrinology operation theatres, Dr. Pooja Ramakant let us scrub in for the operations too. We feel lucky to have the once-in-a-lifetime experience of witnessing surgeries. Yes, we have been the audience to the procedures of Angioplasty, Heart Bypass Surgery, Breast Cancer Surgery, and many more. We toured the OT (operation theatre), acquainting ourselves with the different surgical instruments, witnessed blood oozing out, the rise and fall of the instrument beep in some critical and otherwise cheerful operation environments. We had a few problems and ideas to work on in fifteen exciting days. We researched and presented draft solutions to the concerned doctors. A group of considerate students at KGMU, who called themselves ‘Soul Cushions,’ even organized a hackathon at KGMU which was judged by the doctors. The seven of us were divided into three teams and grouped with MBBS students to solve the hackathon problems.”",
      "",
      "Tarun, another group member, says,“One of the biggest things I noticed was the complementarity of expertise. While the doctors and nurses have the exposure and know how to identify problems, they do not know of the possibilities offered by technology, that can be applied to create solutions. The staff we interacted with were all very welcoming and tried to accommodate our wildest ideas and did their best to answer our myriad queries. Especially Dr. Rishi who made sure things stayed focused while still having fun. Also, for Akshay (another member) and me, it was a great glimpse into the career path we almost chose as we both left the field of medicine to study in IIT.”",
      "The environment of the OT and the hospital took Akshay Shendre back to his college years.“It gave us the glimpse into the reality that how people of the developing nations like ours are sometimes not even able to buy a medicinal item of Rs. 50 which might be easily available in other developed nations. That is the real motivation for me, I think, to use engineering to solve such problems,”he said.",
      "The doctors offered feedback on their instruments and techniques and their team could get the professional opinion on how to apply engineering knowledge to make those instruments better. Sambhav urges IITK students to join this programme as it is a huge learning experience while also very enjoyable.“Students could end up designing solutions to problems which can save lives while learning designing, managing, and networking with people,”he added.",
      "After the successful completion of the program, IITK sent its second batch in the first week of June 2018 to KGMU which also analyzed similar problems as the first batch did. During the rest of the summer of 2018, students from both the batches further brainstormed over the ideas acquired from their experiences at KGMU and shared them with the faculty at IIT Kanpur and developed the prototype. They also discussed their plans with doctors and debated on whether any of them has commercial values.",
      "Future prospects",
      "Prof. Bandyopadhyay feels that our institute is trying its best to set up an entrepreneurial ecosystem, and calls out for support from students and members of the faculty for this goal. His mission is to engage faculty and students on a daily basis; not asking them to start a business right away, but to attend seminars and meetups with doctors and healthcare professionals, which the Bio-Incubator and the BSBE department conducts. For students, he advises, “Be aware of the things around you and something might click.”",

      "We don’t even realize when that one puff, turns into an insatiable craving for more. Addiction can be of anything from gaming, pornography to smoking, drinking or doing drugs. Simply put, addiction is the inability of an individual to stop doing or using something, especially something harmful! It is common knowledge that a big section amongst us is under the influence of addiction, yet it is hardly a topic that comes up in any of our day to day conversations. The key to breaking this downward spiral of addiction is to talk and to seek help. With exactly this perspective in mind, Counselling Service in collaboration with the Health Center established a De-Addiction Clinicon 5th of July, 2018.",
      "It has only been 2 months since the clinic started its operations and its effects can already be seen. A good number of 20 students signed up for the 8 sessions conducted to date. To get a better idea of the clinic’s functioning and addiction in general, our team got in a conversation with Dr. Rohan Kumar, apsychiatrist at Regency Hospital who ishandling the clinic.",
      "Dr. Rohan Kumar told that “The prime addiction amongst the cases registered is nicotine-based, especially smoking. Most other cases fell under internet addiction category.” When posed with the question of what causes these Addictions, he replied that “These addictions generally emerge as a response to some stressful situation in the person’s life which they couldn’t handle properly and affect their studies and relationships. Unfortunately, instead of reaching out to people for help, they fall prey to these detrimental measures. “ Another reason as Pratyush Garg, Coordinator Counselling Service correctly pointed out “is the existence of extreme levels of peer pressure and that constant burden of perfectionism that nudges people towards these addictions”.",
      "How does the camp work?",
      "The camp currently operates on every Thursday between5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.There is no registration required. The institute maintains no record “at all” of the visitors. You are required to fill out a page of details, which is possessed only by the doctor. Mild cases can be treated without medication, by means of psychotherapy, which includes techniques like Motivational Enhancement Therapy and CBT [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]. Moderate cases require medication along with these cognitive measures. After the session with the doctor, the person is followed up by the counselor to check on how efficiently the therapy is working. Although, it generally requires a bit of patience to notice improvements.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "With no such measures existing earlier, it is a big step by the campus to reach out to the people in need and help them. This level of freedom and effort on the part of the institute will surely help in building a channel of trust amongst the campus community and inspire more people to come up and ask for help. Mr. Shoukath Ali, a counselor with the Counselling Service, who is helping coordinate the clinic reaffirmed that “Strict confidentiality of the student is always maintained. People should turn up without fear or hesitation of being judged or prosecuted or looked down upon because the sole purpose of this camp is to relieve them from their dependencies.”",
      "“You were never created to live depressed, defeated, guilty, condemned, ashamed, or unworthy. You were created to be victorious”.",
      "So, come ahead, ask for help and emerge victorious!",

      "Dr Vaidyeswaran Rajaraman is a distinguished Computer Scientist from India. He has been awarded the Padma Bhushan and the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for his contributions to the field of computer science. Dr Rajaraman also served as the Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur in its infancy and played a vital role in setting up India’s first computer science education programme at IIT Kanpur. Here is his story.",
      "",
      "What was IIT Kanpur like when you joined?",
      "I joined IIT Kanpur on the 23rd of March 1963. There was nothing at the Kalyanpur campus at the time. We were based out of the HBTI campus. HBTI had given IIT one little wing to begin. There was one room where all the Electrical Engineering faculty sat. I was the first Assistant Professor to join the department; everyone else was a lecturer. The first batch moved to the Kalyanpur Campus on the 1st of April, 1963 – “April Fools’ Day”. During the summer heat of May and June, we all moved to our campus. There was only a workshop building, and the Electrical Engineering Department was allocated one part of it. There was no Computer Science department back then.",
      "The IBM 1620",
      "The IBM 1620 was a powerful machine and very popular with universities. In August 1963, the IBM 1620 came to IIT Kanpur. We were the first educational institute in India to get a computer; even before IIT Kharagpur, the older institute. The IBM 1620 had a Fortran compiler. Fortran, being a High-Level Language, allowed even non-computer scientists to write programs. We planned on keeping the 1620 in the Western Laboratories building; however, the door wasn’t big enough to accommodate it; we had to break down a wall to bring it in.",
      "The first CS Course at IIT Kanpur",
      "A team of three American professors came to Kanpur along with the 1620 to help us in setting it up. The head of the team was Harry Huskey, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Huskey, a pioneer in the field of computer science, had been a part of the team that built the ENIAC and had even worked with Alan Turing. He, being a forward-looking man, wanted to teach computer programming to all the faculty. He started a 10-day intensive course in programming at IIT Kanpur. The course was open to all so that people from other universities and research labs could take it. There were 60 seats available and 60 rooms in the Visitors’ Hostel, all of which were occupied by those taking the course. A three-hour lecture was held every morning. One hour on programming, one hour on numerical methods and one hour on computer logic. Three batches of 20 were formed to write programs on the 1620 because there were only 20 punching machines available.  It was a very tedious task and required a lot of patience.",
      "TA 306",
      "By 1965, the American team had returned to the United States. IIT Kanpur pioneered the first course in computer programming. The course was a Technical Arts course – TA 306. It was categorised as a TA course because, in those days, the computer was seen as a “tool in a workshop” and not as a “science”. TA 306 was an intensive course in computer programming for all students of IIT-K. I, along with Prof. HN Mahabala, used to take the course.",
      "Principles of Computer Programming",
      "While teaching TA 306, I felt the need for a textbook in programming as the American textbooks were quite expensive. So, I decided to write a book titled ‘Principles of Computer Programming’. It was printed in the graphic arts section of IIT-K and was sold at an affordable price of Rs. 5 at the bookstore. The book became quite popular, and I found out that it was being plagiarised. As a remedial measure, my wife suggested that I publish the book. However, no publisher was willing; they were all very dismissive of computer programming and believed the book would never sell. Finally, I managed to find a willing publisher in Prentice Hall. Prentice Hall agreed to publish the book but in a low-quality print. The first edition came out in 1969. Contrary to the publisher’s apprehensions, within a year, the first edition was sold out. The next print, in 1970, was of better quality. I made it a point to insist that the book is sold at an economical price of only Rs. 15.",
      "The Birth of the CS Programme at IIT Kanpur",
      "In 1965, we started offering an option for master’s students in the Electrical Engineering Department to specialise in Computer Science. This option became very popular with the students. The Electrical Department was unhappy over the declining interest of students in other fields of the department. In 1972, the two disciplines split, and the Senate approved an exclusive master’s programme in computer science. The first batch had about 15 students. TCS hired almost every student in that batch.",
      "Recruiting faculty was proving to be very difficult. Prof. H.N. Mahabala, Prof. Narsingh Deo and I shouldered the entire weight. We had a PhD programme in the electrical department with a thesis in computer science. Some of its students, on graduating, joined us as faculty members. In 1973, we were in for a big shock. IIT Madras got its hands on an IBM 370 and Dr Mahabala, along with some other faculty members, left for Madras.",
      "",
      "The B.Tech in CSE",
      "The CS department started feeling the need for a Bachelor’s programme. In 1976, a proposal for the same was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not look favourably upon it; their view was that it was a vocational course and did not require a bachelor’s programme. The other departments were unwilling to make sacrifices for the new programme. It took a lot of convincing on our part. They grudgingly gave up 2-3 seats each and 20 seats were allocated to us. The first batch of students was admitted in the year 1978.",
      "Convincing people about ‘The Scope of CSE’",
      "Students and their parents were very apprehensive about this new programme. I remember that Rajeev Motwani’s father, who was a naval officer, came up to me and enquired about whether there was any future in Computer Science. I succeeded in convincing people that it was a growing area and held tremendous amounts of potential. The greatest surprise came when the JEE results were declared and the B.Tech programme closed at an AIR of 40. This made everyone, including the other IITs, who didn’t have computer science programmes, take notice.  They all rushed to set up Computer Science departments. At that time, the IITs did not have an official sanction from the ministry to set up a new department to offer a B.Tech in Computer Science; we had done so through ‘devious’ means. All five IITs petitioned the ministry to amend the statutes to formally create departments for Computer Science and Engineering. Kanpur enjoyed a prominent lead over her sister institutes and spearheaded Computer Science education in India.",
      "What do you think about CS education and research in India at present?",
      "Computer Science and Engineering has become immensely popular and grown uncontrollably in recent years due to the employment and entrepreneurship opportunities it offers. Decades ago, I had requested IBM to set up a research park in India; they laughed at it. Today, almost all major companies – IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel have research facilities in the country. I could never have even dreamt about it. Technologies like AI, Deep Learning, IoT are dominating the arena today. However, systems areas like computer architecture are still neglected in India. On the academic side, there is a significant dearth of faculty. Even IITs are unable to fill their sanctioned strengths. IIT Kanpur is also at a disadvantage due to its location.",
      "What is your advice for today’s students?",
      "I want students to think differently, to be innovative and to ask questions. Students must be willing to “get their hands dirty” and indulge in project-oriented work. They must also understand the history and evolution of computers to be able to appreciate the advances in computer science and engineering and take it in new directions.",
      "Any messages for IIT Kanpur?",
      "“I wish IIT Kanpur’s CSE department all the best. It was my baby.”",
      "Dr Rajaraman left IIT Kanpur in 1982 to set up the SERC (Supercomputer Education and Research Centre) at IISc, Bangalore. He is currently an honorary professor at IISc and spends his time writing books and articles. His monograph – ‘The History of Computing in India’ is a famous and well-researched account that dwells deep into the economic, political and social factors that have shaped the history of computers in our country.",

      "On 11th May, 1998, India achieved a major technological breakthrough by successfully carrying out nuclear tests at Pokhran. The day also marks the successful testing of Trishul missile and the first flight of the indigenous aircraft Hansa 3. Hence the day is commemorated as the National Technological day every year. This year at IIT Kanpur, the event was coordinated by the National Center of Flexible Electronics, which was established in 2014.",
      "",
      "The event consisted of a lecture showcasing the stunning work in flexible electronics, along with numerous demonstrations.",
      "Prof. Y. N Mohapatra, who coordinated the event, elaborated that the problem with conventional electronics is that it’s primarily based on silicon, which is expensive to work with. Single crystals of silicon need to be grown, requiring high temperature which requires small wafers, increasing the cost.",
      "With flexible electronics, the aim is to be able to literally “Print Circuits” on a large scale, on plastics and papers. A primitive example of this is the conducting ink. It makes it possible for conduction to happen along the lines drawn on a material, which makes trying circuits by just drawing on a piece of paper.",
      "This also allows the creation of conducting fabric, which can be worn, acting like a Faraday cage, or used to securely shield cards or devices from external influence.",
      "The new idea of printing circuits will also revolutionize lighting, as it allows the creation of efficient OLED panels of light, giving off uniform light from a large area, in contrast to conventional LEDs that are basically point sources.",
      "This also paves the way for the creation of flexible displays.",
      "The technology for printing circuits is now at a primitive stage. Methods such as evaporation need to be adopted. If printing of circuits become as easy as is of newspaper using them will be very cost effective and viable. Today, printing is used to create flexible heaters, which can be used anywhere.",
      "In addition, flexible sensors would be handy in medical sector and the packaging sector where one needs to keep track of temperature, freshness, humidity etc. Most Importantly, it’s application in the renewable solar energy will be substantial, allowing creation of cheap and lightweight solar panels on a mass scale that can be worn, folded and carried. A lot of research on foldable solar cells is being done around the globe.",

      "",
      "Along with the students, professors and their families, school children from the city were also invited to the event. The event ended with walk through demos.",

Mentored byDr. Wasim AhmadofEconomic Sciencesdepartment, the team outperformed teams from some of the top B-Schools of the nation. They have been awarded a cash prize of Rs. 1 Lakh, a trophy and a 3 months internship in any department of RBI.",
      "TheRBI Policy Challenge, is a national level policy making competition, started in the year 2016 by Prof. Raghuram Rajan with the intention to further spread knowledge of thefinancial, monetary and bankingdisciples among the student community. It is a 3-tier competition testing the participants on their financial understanding spanning across a range of skills. The regional round is the Essay Writing competition, which tests your writing and comprehension skills. The topic for this years regional round was,“Can FinTech revolutionize access to finance in India?”Based on the submissions of the first round 7 teams from each of the zones battled it out at the RBI Regional Office on 2nd February in the second policy making round. They were assigned real life problems based on monetary issues the solutions to which had to be presented in a 15 minute presentation. Testing interpretational skills and understanding of contemporary financial skills, the second round involved competition from eminent business schools like IIM Lucknow and DSE. One team from each zone qualified for the final round to be held in Mumbai. They were presented with the topic on the morning of the event itself. In a span of 4 hours they had to be ready with a 15 minute presentation qualitatively analysing the iffs and buts of the topic“Normalisation of the monetary policy in the advanced economies and their implications on India”.",
      "On the day of the finals, once the topics were handed over, all the four teams were left in their allocated rooms for four hours with adequate facilities to prepare the presentation. As Ayush says, “Even our lunch was parcelled to us in packets.”The competition proceeded abiding by all the rules strictly with uptight arrangements. Shedding some light on the final preparation and the technical knowhow, Kartikey said ,“We focused more on the qualitative analysis of the topic. Outline of the presentation covered aspects in global contexts such as oil prices, other countries in advanced economies and their stance on normalisation of monetary policies, the emerging markets worldwide, while coming to Indian scenario the GDP, intensity of its impact on India’s economy and other things were covered.”",
      "Talking on how they went about preparing for the competition, Ayush shared hisexperience saying,“We began working up in winters post end semester exams. In 15 days we were done with the essay. It had to be taken care that it must be appealing and not plagiarised. After a lot of reading and brainstorming sessions we made it through the regional and zonal. For the national round we received some links and emails from RBI instructing about the ideal presentation and its format, leading to possible topics for the finals. Our mentor Dr.Wasim also provided us some papers and stuff to read.”He further remarked,“We formulated some presentations beforehand based on a couple of RBI reports on monetary policies and World bank’s report on India’s development and inflation. It was a challenging journey for the trophy, as the last round fell around semester exams, and each one of us missed at least one exam.”",
      "But, as for every other journey, what matters in the end is the experience it brings with it. As Ayush says,“It was a fantastic experience in terms of growing and learning. The courses and exams would never amount to the practical knowledge and skills we developed working together as a team. We got a little touch of how real governors present their solutions in the meetings by stepping in their shoes for a short while. We enacted a role play of a team of governors, with Kartikey being the governor and other team members as deputy governors for the presentation.”",
      "We, once again, would like to congratulate the team for this huge success and wish them all the very best for their future endeavours.",

      "The University Grants Commission (UGC), Govt. of India had released a notice in September ‘17 inviting proposals for a new scheme,‘Institute of Eminence’ (IOE). 10 public and 10 private Indian institutes of higher education will be termed as Institute of Eminence. But only the Institutes which feature in the top 50 positions NIRF rankings will be eligible to apply.",
      "The selected institutes will be provided with regulatory architecture which would facilitate them to emerge as world-class teaching and research institutions. This proposal came soon after the Indian government called off the funds of Project Vishwajeet and scrapped it.The selected institutes will get financial assistance from the government in addition to financial and administrative autonomy.",
      "IITK had formed a committee tasked with the preparation of the IOE proposal. The committee consists of Professors: Sandeep Sharma (CHM), A K Ghosh (AE), V Shankar (CHE), Raghu Nandan Sengupta (IME) and Sandeep Shukla (CSE).",
      "Institutes of Eminence will get financial aid from the government, amounting a total of Rs 1000 Cr equally distributed across 5 years. Though the financial assistance is to be extended only to the public institutes. The grant will be in form of seed funding and the institutes will have to raise money from industry or other sources to sustain those initiatives. All the institutes will be financially autonomous in terms of their expending the allocated and raised money.",
      "Further, the institutes would be allowed to take foreign students in a greater capacity. Up to 30% of admitted domestic students can be foreign students. And there will be no restriction on the fees charged from foreign students. Also, subject to a few caps, the IOEs will be allowed to determine the fees of domestic students as well given no admission is turned down due to lack of finances. Similarly, on faculty front, as much as a fourth of the faculty can be from outside India. These institutes will also be allowed to hire personnel from industry who are experts in a field but do not have higher education qualifications.",
      "The IOEs will also get greater freedom in academic affairs. They will be allowed to offer more interdisciplinary courses. Subject to a few restrictions, the IOEs can also decide course structure and credit hours on their own, giving them further autonomy.",
      "Prof Sandeep Shukla though raised a concern that the number of private institutions in India which are capable of competing at a world level is very few. And if those universities which are not at the top level are given the label, it will only enable them to increase their fees with no real difference in functioning. When asked about chances of IITK, Prof Shukla replied that he is cautiously optimistic about chances of IIT Kanpur, considering the high competition.",
      "He feels regardless of how fruitful this artificial push may or may not be in the longer run, the rethinking that is being done to ameliorate the functioning will help. It should at the very least serve as an opportunity to introspect. Even those institutes which do not make the cut should try to enact some of the reforms in the proposal through external help.",
      "Although Prof Shukla is quite excited about this scheme, he is skeptical of the fact that improving the global rankings should not be a primary concern as there are several factors beyond our control. One reason why Indian Institutes do not do very well on the rankings is that the expenditure is converted to dollars for conversion. The purchase parity is not considered and thus Indian institutes are at a disadvantage because of it. Thus, he emphasizes that patent filings, publications, research fundings, collaborations and technology transfer needs to be given higher weight to further substantiate the claim. Another reason why foreign institutes do well on these rankings in comparison to IITs is that these are multidisciplinary institutions. Having Law schools, medical schools and other disciplines brings in diversity and also brings in more funding from different sources.",
      "Contrary to Project Vishwajeet, the new scheme, Institute of Eminence gives an equal opportunity to all institutes in the top bracket to contest. This project seems to have the potential to propel Indian institutions to the top 100 institutes in the world.  The government has set the deadline for submitting the proposal at 12th December. The list of selected institutes and the details of their plans will be revealed soon after.",

      "There are some fundamental questions about life at IIT Kanpur which only experience and sound advise help us answer. Starting out, everyone has a vision of acing all the courses and getting the highest possible grades. But life here is not one as dimensional as one gets used to in their JEE days. From cultural activities to sports, technical projects to making memories for life and of course academics, a lot goes on in the life of a student. Hence managing them all is not a trivial thing. Hence in this article, we give answers to all these major questions that freshers have from seniors who have made their way through these inconceivable amounts of activities.",
      "With the end sems approaching, how feasible it is to actually study through pre-exam night-outs?",
      "While the question is highly subjective, the consensus is that night-outs are not something which can be planned. They always are the last resort. Soumyadeep Dutta, a third-year student, said that only the people who have the ability to alter their body clock and still have the nerve to deliver during the exam can pull off night-outs. But if someone cannot do so then studying regularly cannot be substituted by night-outs. Amlan Kar, Y13 alumni presently pursuing Ph.D. at the University of Toronto, had aligned views and added that one only retains the topics they are regular with. What one studies during the night-outs is retained only till the exam, that too if one is lucky.",
      "A related phenomenon is missing classes. What should be done if the professor does not teach well? Is skipping classes justified in this case?",
      "The first port of call should be to approach the professor. If the professor is not aware of the problem then it’s not possible for him/her to rectify it. Skipping classes without doing so is the result one’s laziness. In case one does not feel comfortable in doing so, then they should get help from the counseling service. The AM system can prove to be very useful in such cases. But if things still do not work out comfortably then keeping track of the progress of the course is the bare minimum. Amlan said that missing out classes must be made up by self-study. He said, “If you’re wasting that time sleeping, or watching a movie, then probably you need to reconsider.” He suggested that self-study can be supplemented with online courses, it’s just that the person must be vigilant. The online sources such as NPTEL, Coursera, et al can prove to be very useful.",
      "How important is CPI at the end of the day?",
      "Amlan said, “CPI is like a key to a door, a higher CPI opens up certain doors that a lower CPI will not. But in the end, there is always a door. It acts as a parameter for hard work but not for someone’s intelligence. It is an opportunity to present yourself in a better light.” It is clear that though working hard for a high CPI is surely worth it but not getting one does not mean that one is not left with options. If a person has enough zeal for doing something, CPI cannot hold him back. Soumyadeep added that along with maintaining a decent CPI focus should also be on improving soft skills and general knowledge. There are ample opportunities to work on them here but will be scarce if left for future.",
      "Staying on point of soft skills or life skills. Do clubs really help here?",
      "Bhuvi Gupta, a third-year student who is the coordinator of the robotics club, said that developing an interest or hobby is important. It gives a person an escape from the humdrum of daily life and adds a new dimension to their characters. Anshumali, also a third-year student and coordinator of the dramatics club, added that in club activities people learn to push their limits. He further impressed that clubs inculcate patience and commitment, qualities which are expected from individuals looking to be successful and they can be learned best through extracurricular activities. Learning to coordinate with a team, brainstorming for major events, planning, and most importantly execution is what both of them emphasized a person gets to learn through clubs. Soumyadeep also said that just being worked up about academics does not justify one’s existence here, living a social life is of equal importance.",
      "How should one choose from the innumerable options that are out there?",
      "Bhuvi shared her experience saying that due to the lack of time she had to limit her participation in extracurricular activities. Joining a Science and Technology club was something that appealed to her so she tried it first. Electronics club was her first stop but she moved to robotics club from second year onwards. She emphasized that opportunities for participation elsewhere continue to exist for her, even in her third year. It’s just a matter of realization of interest and an intent to participate. Anshumali also mentioned that there have been people who participated in dramatics for the first time in their fourth year. He said that one should try exploring their creative space and they will know what activities suit them. It is never late to try.",
      "But clubs take up so much time. How does one manage everything else with them?",
      "To this Anshumali responded, “Things do get hectic, but that is how we learn to manage time and not to waste it.” He mentioned how everyone misconstrues the whole scenario and the real culprits, Facebook, Whatsapp, DOTA, and movies go unnoticed. He further added that many people are not ready to push their limits which is why they fail to manage clubs in their schedule. Bhuvi added, “Time spent with like-minded people can do wonders for a person. If one feels that doing an activity is helping them relax or take a break, then they should go ahead with it.” Amlan talked about his concept of the time budget saying that not everything one wishes to do can be squeezed into the 24 available hours. Things need to be planned out otherwise some interests will have to be left out for other higher priority tasks.",
      "So, as one can see it’s all about the choices one makes and the paths one wishes to take. Many people have chosen trodden paths when they encountered that ‘fork’ in their lives, while others exist who have paved their way through the fork. To conclude “The challenge is not to manage time but to manage ourselves”– Stephen Covey",

      "In the wake of the suspension of twenty two students for involvement in a case of ragging, the national media was flooded with articles about this incident. It was unfortunate to see how the primary sources of information for the nation were misrepresenting facts and trying to sensationalise the issue. The article published byHindustan Timeson 10th October is one such example which is replete with incorrect details. Here are a few excerpts from the article where facts were misrepresented :",
      "“The ragging was recorded on cell phones and circulated on social media groups.”",
      "“In addition, the president and other office bearers of the student gymkhana were removed from their respective posts allegedly for ignoring the complaints.”",
      "“About 30 junior students filed a complaint to the dean of student affairs against 50 seniors, saying they were thrashed, abused, and forced to do inhuman acts on August 20.”",
      "“Action against the senior students was expedited only after one of the professors at the institute wrote about the incident on his blog.”",
      "As the campus media body, we feel it is our duty to set the record straight and report the events correctly. Here are some some questions whose answers might lift the shroud off of the facts. The answers have been pieced together based on discussions with the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA), Prof. P Shunmugaraj and student nominees to the Senate Student’s Advisory Committee (SSAC). They represent the views of the SSAC and the Academic Senate as collective decision making bodies and not of any particular individual.",
      "Q. What were the sequence of events that led to the action being taken against the students?",
      "A. On the night of 20th August, the ‘baap wing’ was organised in Hall 2 where freshmen were required to spend the night with the second year students who resided in their wings the previous year. The next day, the DoSA met the student Hall Executive Committee (HEC) members and enquired about the incident. They denied knowledge of the incident but over the next few days the DoSA received complaints about the incident. He requested the students who were forced to participate in the ‘baap wing’ to write testimonies detailing the events and identifying the seniors. This information was taken to the SSAC and the committee proposed the suspension of 22 students which included the members of the HEC and other students who were on the scene. When these recommendations were taken to the Academic Senate on 21st September, it directed the SSAC to allow the accused students to present their side of the story and subsequently propose punishments. The said students were asked to appear before the SSAC on 2nd October and a one year suspension was proposed for six students and termination for sixteen others. On presenting this recommendation to the Academic Senate on 3rd October, the termination sentence was reduced to a three year suspension.",
      "Q. What were the nature of the complaints?",
      "A. The first complaint the DoSA received was from a freshman over mail. In it, he protested against things like vulgar language, rude behaviour, restrictions on clothing, etc. which the seniors were responsible for. He was unhappy about the interaction with seniors on the night of the Treasure Hunt (an annual activity for freshers where they have to complete a scavenger hunt which might require them to go to senior students for help). Based on accounts from a friend, he also mentioned the occurrence of the ‘baap wing’ and the interaction of students with the President, Students’ Gymkhana and an alumnus (who was working on a startup being incubated in campus). The DoSA also received complaints specifically appealing against the ‘baap wing’ subsequently.",
      "Q. What was the action taken against the President and the alumnus? Why were they punished?",
      "A. There was a complaint against the President of a verbal exchange between a freshman and him, which the SSAC believed was tantamount to abuse of power and hence he was asked to resign from his post. The alumni was accused of indulging in ragging on the night of 14th August during the treasure hunt and was barred from seeking residence in the campus for the future.",
      "Q. How were the students identified? Was it solely based on the written complaints? If not, what other proofs assisted the investigation?",
      "A. The identification was based solely on the complaints and testimonies of the aggrieved students. The complainants were asked to identify the senior students and all the students whose names they were able to come up with were considered guilty. The members of the HEC were also included in the list of guilty students because it was believed that they were complicit in organising the baap wing and did not make any effort to prevent it from happening. The HEC was also penalised for denying knowledge of the ‘baap wing’ when the DoSA visited them (along with Gymkhana office bearers and other faculty members).",
      "Q. How was a distinction made between the students who were awarded varying durations of suspension?",
      "A. The accused students were interviewed by the SSAC and based on their understanding of the degrees of involvement, they were awarded different punishments. The students who were awarded a lenient sentence were present on the scene for a very short period of time. They either joined the proceedings late or left early.",
      "Q. Why were the students not called the first time around? Wasn’t that against the procedure of investigation?",
      "A. It is standard procedure for SSAC to invite the student(s) against whom a complaint is lodged. A copy of the complaint is also handed to the student and a chance is given to defend oneself. In this particular case, the SSAC felt that protecting the identity of the complainants was of paramount importance. If the accused students were invited to the SSAC, they would have been able to make the connection between the complaints and complainants. When the Academic Senate mandated that the students be given a chance to present their side of the story, measure were taken to ensure that there was no physical interaction between the two parties. The students were escorted from the campus gate and were required to leave the campus soon after the interview was done. Even when they came to collect their belongings after the sentence was formally announced, they were given specific time windows to do so.",
      "Q. Why was no action taken against other people responsible like warden?",
      "A. The warden(s) intimated the DoSA about the instances of ragging going on in the halls and requested him to take action. Thus, the committee did not have reason to believe that they were turning a blind eye or were not motivated to stop this menace.",
      "Q. If the investigation reveals more names, what will be the future course of action?",
      "A. The interrogation of the punished students did reveal more names and the same has been communicated to the Academic Senate. The decision rests with the Senate whether to take action against the students or not.",
      "Incidents like these are very sensitive and the dignity of many students is at stake. It is highly irresponsible for national media to publish incorrect information to grab eyeballs. While the importance of taking information to the masses in undeniable, it should be done carefully. We hope that media outlets take more care in the future while handling incidents of this nature.",

      "The Institute recently suspended 16 second-year undergraduate students for three years and 6 others for one year on charges of involvement in an incident of ragging. The IIT Kanpur Academic Senate took the decision upon recommendation from the Student Senate Advisory Committee (SSAC). Deputy Director, Dr. Manindra Agrawal was quoted by Times of India, saying that because the charges against the students were extremely serious, the decision had to be taken to send a strong message to students to say no to ragging and maintain decorum.",
      "The committee found them guilty based on the statements of the students of freshman year and confessions of the accused. It must be noted that not all the 22 students were directly involved in the ragging. A few of them were, by their own admission, absent from the venue where the said incident took place. They were charged with being guilty of dereliction of duty for failing to prevent the incident in spite of holding ‘Positions of Responsibility’. (These students were members of Hall Executive Committee)",
      "Regardless of the unfair nature of the judgement, the decision was a vicious one, given the culture of the institute students are groomed in. At IIT Kanpur, freshman undergraduates are ragged, typically by sophomores, during their first year. The ritual is so well-ingrained into the culture of the institute that various acts performed have specific monikers attached to them. The acts can range anywhere from being made to introduce oneself in chaste Hindi to stripping and putting one’s clothes inside out (in one’s own privacy but within a stipulated time). Although the practice is horrifying enough as it is, it is only fair to mention that at no point during the course of ragging is a student touched physically by a senior (several reports in some national dailies have suggested that the students were thrashed, which is utterly incorrect). The incident in question was one of the many such incidents that have been happening in the institute for a long time and are most defintiely, not an aberration.",
      "While there can be no rationalisation for such behaviour, it must be said that the decision to suspend students for such prolonged periods is unreasonable, one that tries to correct decades of institutional wrong with one monstrous judgement. Most students, including the ones being suspended, have been ragged with equal brutality in their freshman year. They have learned, to their astonishment, that the administration is all too complacent to care. Most freshmen come to IIT Kanpur detesting such practices as much as any rational being would. But by the end of the first year, they, too, are a part of this malicious spiral, all thanks to the enabling environment that sustains it. Such is the normalisation of ragging IIT Kanpur that a substantial proportion of students sincerely believes that it is beneficial, even necessary for the development of freshmen.",
      "The only brief a freshman gets from the Counselling Service with respect to ragging is that when a particular interaction (an innocuous-sounding euphemism for ragging in campus parlance) gets uncomfortable, it should be made known to the senior driving the interaction. The word uncomfortable works quite like a codeword and in most cases, the ragging is stopped immediately. But for someone facing ten odd seniors in a position of presumed power, what is comfortable and what is not lies in the realm of the occult. Just the fact that institute’s 7-day orientation program for freshers (which includes sessions on ‘road safety’ and ‘community welfare’) makes no mention of ragging or its redress goes a long way in explaining how little the institute cares to curb it.",
      "During 2016, a hostel warden, on receiving a written complaint for ragging, responded by telling the freshmen in the hostel, during its General Body Meeting (the only time of the year the warden actually meets the students), that all such complaints must be sent to the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) and not to him. The HEC is the student body which was accused of ragging in the complaint. This incident is to say nothing of countless other complaints that have yielded no or meek responses. One is left wondering how the institute suddenly starts suspending students on charges of ragging when it was forwarding similar complaints to the accused until last year.",
      "The freshers being being made to enact a pole dance (with one student becoming the pole and another the dancer) on stage in the auditorium during the orientation programme is a peculiar case. The Academic Senate almost punished over a hundred student volunteers of the Counselling Service for allowing it to happen in their presence. The Counselling Service is headed by a professor and includes three institute appointed counsellors. The fact that an institute body allowed this activity to happen for all these years and then found it fair to punish the students epitomizes the legitimacy accorded to ragging in the institute.",
      "It won’t be a stretch to say that everyone, from the security staff to the Counselling Service, were aware of the all too common incidents of ragging that happened inside hostels (many of the professors are recent graduates of IIT Kanpur too). As such, they tacitly approved of the practices all through the decades. Yet the Senate had no qualms about suspending 22 students for actions they were told, during their one year of stay in the college, were completely normal.",
      "The efforts of the institute to stop ragging on the campus have been shallow and skin-deep, restricted to the ritualistic displaying of anti-ragging posters. The historic supreme court judgement of May 8, 2009 ordered the implementation of recommendations made by Raghavan Committee to ‘see that the ugly scar of ragging was obliterated from the face of educational institutions’. Over the years, IIT Kanpur has brazenly flouted many of the guidelines including, but not limited to, the ones paraphrased below.",
      "1. Joint sensitization programme and counseling of both ‘freshers’ and seniors by a Professional counselor",
      "2. Joint orientation programme of ‘freshers’ and seniors to be addressed by the principal/Head of the institution, and the anti-ragging committee",
      "3. Each batch of freshers should be divided into small groups and each such group shall be assigned to a member of the staff. Such staff member should interact individually with, each member of the group on a daily basis for ascertaining the problems/difficulties if any faced by the fresher in the institution and extending necessary help.",
      "4. Freshers shall be lodged in a separate hostel block, wherever possible.",
      "5. Brochures or booklet/leaflet distributed to each student at the beginning of each academic session for obtaining undertaking not to indulge or abet ragging, shall contain the blueprint of prevention and methods of redress.",
      "Had the institute adhered to these guidelines, generations of students would have been spared both the emotional trauma of being ragged and the agony of becoming perpetrators themselves. Perhaps the institute can start following basic guidelines to stop ragging.",
      "The institute must realise that the cure to the menace lies in taking reformatory action against the students involved and sensitising its students regarding the issue, and not in handing down barbaric punishments to ones who are but victims of this sordid culture. It has, for long, overlooked its responsibility in eradicating ragging from the campus, exemplified by nothing better than its failure to adhere to Supreme Court guidelines. The institute cannot hold its students to the same standards of Supreme Court regulations that it has failed to abide by. By choosing to give exemplary punishment to an unfortunate bunch of students for decades of institutional wrong, IIT Kanpur is more than just mislaying its moral compass.",

      "On 31st August, a postgraduate student at IIT Kanpur told the Students’ Senate about her horrific experience with the Institute security. She alleged being threatened and verbally abused by Mr. Sandeep Shivare, the Security Officer (SO) at IIT.",
      "This is not an isolated incident. The meeting of the Senate was the culmination of a series of incidents and revelations regarding security overreach at the campus, which left the campus community appalled, and concerned about their own safety, freedom, and security.",
      "The first domino was flipped on the evening of 30th August, when an Open House meet had been scheduled by a group of faculty and students to discuss the issues relating to the firing of Visitor Hostel (VH) staff. Vaibhav Vaish, an alumnus, and winner of the Director’s Gold Medal in 2004, was initially denied entry by the SiS (Institute security) guards because he did not have an ID card.",
      "He was allowed to attend the meeting after faculty members intervened.",
      "During the meeting, it came to be known that a student had been apprehended by the SiS guards on the previous night and taken to the security control room, while he was putting up posters for the open house. The reason: the student did not have permission for putting up posters—something that is unheard of in the Institute.",
      "After the meet, the attendees found more than a dozen SiS guards, along with members of the Uttar Pradesh police waiting for them. Mr. Vaish was asked to step aside, apparently for security-related questioning. A video emerged the next morning, depicting an altercation between security members, and faculty and students. It became clear that the Institute’s Security had been “given” sweeping powers to enforce security measures as they saw fit by Dr. Deepu Philip, professor and chairman of Security Advisory and Executive Committee.",
      "A special meeting of the Senate was then scheduled for the 31st August, where increasing interference from security on campus was one of the agenda items.",
      "New, shocking revelations came up during this meet.",
      "A final year undergraduate student recounted his experience. One summer night, he was in the OAT, watching an Indo-Pak cricket match with his friends. While leaving the venue, he was asked to produce his ID card. He did not have it with him. He was misbehaved with, and taken to the SiS control room for questioning. In the SiS control room, Dr. Philip appeared again. The student was threatened that he would be charged with sections 151 (which relates to unlawful assembly and disturbance of public peace) and 153 (which relates to rioting) of the Indian Penal Code. He was then asked to write a statement, and then to modify his original words, as it showed the security officials in a negative light. Already having suffered hours of mental agony, he relented, wrote a statement more aligned to what they wanted, and was let go.",
      "An M.Tech student in the Dept. of Aerospace Engineering also shared her experience in the Senate. Her problem began when she noticed a man loitering on the 2nd floor of GH-2. To discover the identity of the individual, she went to the gate to look at the entry register. She was told that it was Mr. Shivhare, the security officer and that he was not mandated to make any entry in the hall registers. The guard did check the register though, and there was an entry made under the name of “S.K.S”. Having seen the entry, she assumed the matter was sorted. Twenty minutes later, a lady guard knocked on her door and told her Mr. Shivhare wanted to talk to her. In spite of her assurances that the matter was sorted, Mr. Shivare launched into a tirade. Mr. Shivhare continued by saying that the entry register washisproperty since he was the security in charge of the campus and that she had no right to view the contents of the register. About half an hour later, she was summoned to meet an officer downstairs. There, she found an officer in khaki uniform, two SiS guards, and Mr. Shivhare’s relative, waiting for her. The relative started accusing her of trying to intrude into her personal life. The officer present noted down her roll number, and other such details, and let her go.",
      "The Deputy Director subsequently sent out an email to all on 1st September, saying that security personnel will be trained and briefed appropriately. The email also mentioned that the Chairman, SAEC (Prof. Phillip) had offered his resignation from the post. Even though a local news report suggests that the resignation has been rejected, there has been no official communication in this regard.",

On 2nd September 2017, the Senate Students’ Affairs Committee (SSAC), decided to take punitive action over 100 students, and punishments included all possible actions in the purview of the SSAC. The student nominees of SSAC couldn’t divulge more information because they were bound to maintain confidentiality of the proceedings of the committee, until the order is communicated to the students involved.",

      "A silent solidarity march was taken out at 5:30 PM on 24th August 2017 in campus to protest against the dismissal of 72 workers (out of strength of 74) of the Visitors’ Hostel (VH). We decided to explore the matter in more depth and conversed with the Deputy Director, Prof. Manindra Agrawal.",
      "As is known to everybody by now, the change of contract of the VH is the reason behind the layoff. The primary bone of contention between the two sides is the rationale behind the change and subsequent layoff of workers. While the protesting students and faculty believe that the services rendered by the workers have been consistently good, Prof. Agrawal informed us that the administration has received several complaints regarding the low quality of services and moreover, many workers have been found indulging in activities that were unbecoming of them. On asking for further details into these ‘activities’, Prof. Agrawal preferred not to divulge those details on a public platform. Thus, the motivation behind the change in tender was primarily based on quality of services.",
      "To improve the services of the VH following the complaints, a committee was formed which decided to float a tender for the VH. Like every tender floated by the institute, open bids were invited and anybody was eligible to apply. In addition to the process followed, a team visited the facilities of the bidders to ensure that the services were up to the mark. The contract was finally awarded to Sarovar Hotels.",
      "The agitators believe that even if the contractor had to be changed, there were no valid grounds for laying off the workers. The contractor could have started operations while retaining the old workers and the institute should have taken measures to ensure this. Prof. Agrawal believes that since the process of restarting services in the VH had been delayed, the contractor brought experienced workers with him to get things up and running as soon as possible. This in turn meant that most of the current workers would be unemployed starting 1st September, when the contractor is supposed to take charge. In parallel the contractor planned to conduct interviews which would continue for a certain period and the decision to retain workers would be made subsequently. This uncertainty of employment raised concerns among the community and in turn the Director instructed Sarovar hotels to speed up the interview process so that the interim period of unemployment can be reduced. But, it was inevitable that certain workers would find themselves without a job even after the process was completed, either due to incompetence or due to requirements of the new contractor. There have been some concerns regarding the interviews conducted by the contractor too, wherein the concerned community members believe workers were asked irrelevant questions which in no way could be used to decide their future employment. Prof. Agrawal informed us that those were informal interactions that the contractor decided to hold because he was visiting the campus and had some time on his hands. The formal interviews have commenced and a decision would be take based on these interactions.",
      "To mitigate this problem of unemployment, the institute decided to train the laid off workers, at its own expense, in skills that would help them find employment elsewhere. The administration has also highlighted a favourable situation for the workers in the establishment of new messes where they may be able to find employment. The advantage is that working in hostel messes is not as demanding as lending services to the VH, so it is likely that even if they are unable to meet the standards of the VH, they would be accepted in the new environment.",
      "The reason why the institute authorities are not willing to force the hand of the contractor into retaining the workers is quality of service. According to Prof. Agrawal, the administration does not want to give the contractor a reason to not deliver good quality services, which he would get if forced to work with the old staff. Cancellation of the contract, he believes would not be a possibility as it was done via proper procedure and there are no grounds to cancel it. As for the transparency of the tendering process, the institute already has a well defined, public procedure, he says.",
      "An additional concern that has been raised is with regard to the contracts of the hall messes which are to be renewed soon. Concerned members of the community believe that there might be a possibility of hundreds of mess workers losing their jobs since a precedence is being set by the VH incident. Also, the argument of quality of service may be applied in the messes too and new deluxe restaurants might be given contracts. This introduces the possibility of old workers being fired for not meeting the quality criteria. To confirm these concerns we contacted Pratyush Rai, CoSHA convener. He negates this fear of firing off mess workers, as a deluxe restaurant can’t get the contract for the hostel messes as it will have a direct impact on the BDMR. Secondly, small and medium size contractors will have to pay for the relocation of the workers, which is not a sound idea considering the fact that mess establishment charge is also administered. Hence they will prefer to retain the existing mess workers. Pratyush further added that the mess workers are aware of their rights and the administration ensures that they receive the minimum wages. So, the concern about the job security of the mess workers is unfounded.",
      "With each passing day, more concerns are being raised and there are still many unanswered questions in this debate. We will keep the readers updated about the proceedings.",

      "In March this year, the Senate approved the proposal of procuring funds from external sources for all the entities of the Students’ Gymkhana. It is proposed that the following activities would be considered for funding: General Championship or Gymkhana Calendar events, new council events or initiatives (as per the discretion of the General Secretary), capital and infrastructure requirements of clubs and capital requirements of cells. This list is not fixed and maybe extended in course of time.",
      "All the councils and cells will be allowed to reach out to potential sponsors independently or directly in the consultation with the Chief Marketing Manager (CMM), or the President. However, the Chief Marketing Executives (who is the General Secretary, in case of councils or the Overall Coordinator, for cells) will submit the final request for the approval of the CMM. In case the deal consists of CSR contracts, the CMM will coordinate with the heads of institute festivals to check for a clash of interests for a particular company or the third company. The proposal will finally be reviewed by the DoRA office.",
      "Any council/cell which will avail the external sponsorships would be required to submit the branding report as per the proposal approved by the Director, to the company/third party mentioning how the clauses in the contract of the deal were fulfilled. This report would be verified by the CMM.",
      "As of now, the festivals, Antaragni, Techkriti. Udghosh and events like E-Summit are allowed to continue under their independent marketing wings.",

      "Inclusion of Academics in GC",
      "The academics of a pool will now carry a 15% weightage of the total GC points. Although the exact structure of the breakup of points under academics is yet to be finalised, there have been discussions to include the number of students receiving academic excellence awards, the number of students in academic probation and those receiving warnings, the number of students going for international and national conferences, foreign research internships and the number of publications as parameters to be considered in academics, in addition to the the average CPI, which remains the status quo. The reason cited for proposing the above modifications was the fact that the average CPI was so redundant a factor that the difference was only observed in the fifth decimal place of the points tally and hence was ignorable.",
      "The HECs were the principal opponents of the proposal in particular and the inclusion of academics in general. The senators opposed to the idea were of the opinion that academics must remain the prerogative of the institute administration and the Gymkhana could do without additional academic pressure on the students and the resulting curtailed participation in GC events. He also went on to say that such measures would be ineffective in resolving the problem of forced participation of freshers, as was the view of some in the senate.",
      "On the other hand, the proponents of the proposal were confident that it will work towards the overall encouragement of academics in the institute, saying that given the impressive track record of the HECs in getting things done, this might be the most effective way to improve the institute’s academic state of affairs and should not be seen as an additional burden on the HECs. Some measures that were suggested be adopted by the HECs are pre-planning of events to avoid clashes with quizzes, limiting the number of night-outs required of freshers as well as suspending all activities on regular days rather than stretching late into the night.",
      "Business Club to be merged with the Entrepreneurship Cell",
      "Anvesh Jadon, General Secretary of Science and Technology Council raised this agenda with the primary arguments being the overlap of activities of Business Club (B-Club) with E-Cell and a constant decline in the B-Club’s activities, observed in the recent years.",
      "Other reasons considered while accepting the proposal were the involvement of E-Cell with the IME department, the alignment of interests of the B-Club towards the competitions conducted by E-Cell, the activeness of Entrepreneurship and Business clubs of other colleges where they work in cohesion.",
      "This year, the B-Club activities will be looked over by 3 core team members constituting of Head Marketing, Head Corporate Relations and one MBA student who will be from the core team. The following events have been planned for the coming year : case studies, stock trading and group discussion competitions in Takneek, workshops on performing case studies by IME faculty members, assisting SPO with GDs before the placement sessions, reinitiating summer projects offered by the club and associating the faculty of IME for the same.",
      "Mayank Chauhan, Overall Coordinator E-Cell, was positive towards this development, “The initiatives and activities that were in the ambit of the erstwhile Business Club, could prove to be of great significance in giving an exposure of the non-core environment to the individual. Further, they could prove to be essential skill builders that could assist a future entrepreneur. After its restructuring into a wing of the Entrepreneurship Cell, we aim to revive the Business Club activities by providing a broader perspective through our corporate outreach and better campus reinforcement through the assistance of IME faculties and MBA student members of our team.”",

      "The institute decided to initiate an Inter Disciplinary Programme (IDP) in Cognitive Sciences (CogSci) vide office order DIR/IITK/2017/OO-43 on June 1, 2017. The full details about the programme can be found on the programmewebsite. Vox Populi decided to convey the bare essentials of the programme and also got in touch with Prof. Achla Raina, the first HoD, to get some more details.",
      "An Interdisciplinary program brings together many disciplines to create new knowledge,perspectives, skills, interconnections, and epistemology in an educational setting.The concept of IDPs is not new to IIT Kanpur as it has successfully launched several IDPs like – Material Science, Design Programme, Nuclear Engineering and Technology and Photonic Science and Engineering. The IDP in Cognitive Science will thus be IIT Kanpur’s fifth foray into these programmes.",
      "Cognitive science is the study of mind and its processes. The field lies at the intersection of several disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, computer science, linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. Typical research areas of cognitive science include reasoning and decision making, language comprehension and production, language acquisition, vision, attention, learning & memory, goal directed movement in complex environments and consciousness.",
      "In India, Centre of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (CBCS), University of Allahabad; Centre for Neural & Cognitive Sciences, Hyderabad Central University; Centre for Cognitive Science, IIT-Gandhinagar; School of Cognitive Science, Jadavpur University and Indian Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysore offer postgraduate programmes. Moreover, the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, has recognized Cognitive Science as the fourth pillar of Science and Technology in India.",
      "Traditionally, cognitive sciences has been a research oriented field and most of the students who pursue an MS or PhD, choose to continue to research. However, there is a thriving market for jobs in this field too. Opportunities are available in the fields of cognitive computing, natural language processing, usability research, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), advertising, etc. Organisations such as Google, Microsoft, DRDO, Nielsen are actively hiring for their CogSci departments.",
      "Our institute is well placed to start a research program in cognitive science since several faculty members in different departments have research interests which are rooted in this field. As a testament to the interest of the institute in this field, a course ‘Introduction to Cognitive Science’ has been running as an elective for a number of years. Officially, the following professors have expressed interest in this programme :",
      "BSBE: Nitin Gupta, Jonaki SenCSE: Nisheeth Srivastava, Harish KarnickEE: Tanaya GuhaHSS (Philosophy): A V Ravishankar Sarma, Vineet SahuHSS (Linguistics): Achla RainaHSS (Psychology): Ark Verma, Devpriya Kumar, Shikha Dixit",
      "The institute is offering a PhD, MS; and for undergraduates, the option to pursue a Double Major, Dual Degree or Minor in Cognitive Sciences. The PhD admissions are ongoing whereas MS students will be admitted from Fall 2018.",
      "According to Prof. Raina, IIT Kanpur also plans to offer an undergraduate BS in Cognitive Science once it becomes a full fledged department in about five years.",
      "The institute is planning to create a pool of institutions offering MS in Cognitive Sciences to have joint entrance exam for students who have completed bachelors in Cognitive Science or related disciplines. Students coming from examinations of national importance like the GATE, will be provided with scholarship while those coming just after bachelor’s degree will have to self-finance their expenditure.",
      "The prescribed course structure for the MS programme covers 150 credits which will be divided between coursework (78 credits) and thesis work (72 credits) as follows.",
      "",
      "Students having completed a bachelor’s or master’s degree in any field of engineering or medicine or a master’s degree in Cognitive Science or related fields will be eligible to apply for the PhD programme. A new entrance test will be designed which will involve both a written test and interviews.",
      "The course component of the doctoral program will require the students to take a minimum of 4 core courses, which will be common to the Masters Program. In addition, the students will be advised to take Elective Courses and in addition, a seminar in each semester after the second. Other requirements will be as per the current requirements for PhD students.",
      "We hope that IIT Kanpur will become a leader in the CogSci academia as it has in many other disciplines.",

      "A fresh batch of students bid farewell to IIT Kanpur as the 50th Convocation of IIT Kanpur was held in two sessions on 15th and 16th June, 2017. A total of 1544 students graduated, with 599 students from the undergraduate programs (including double major) and 945 from post graduate programs (including dual degrees). Following the practice of the last few years, the institute published the graduation data as part of the Convocation Brochure.",
      "The number of graduating B.Tech and BS students, organised by their branches follows this distribution.",
      "",
      "The overwhelming strength of the Electrical Engineering (EE) department is apparent; one is more likely to run into a B.Tech EE student than a UG girl in IIT Kanpur !",
      "The following chart represents the strength of graduating dual degree type A (in parent departments) students.",
      "",
      "In terms of strength of students, Mechanical Engineering (ME) is at the top of the list. In terms of the percentage of students opting for a dual degree, Economics (ECO) and Mathematics and Scientific Computing (MnC) are the most preffered, data shows. Using last year’s convocation data, we can get a comparison between the 4and 5 year students. ME graduated 62 B.Tech and 35 BT-MT. The number for ECO stands at 13 BS and 26 BS-MS and for MnC, 28 BS and 23 BS-MS, translating to 67% and 45% dual degree students for the Y12 batch for ECO and MnC.",
      "Anupreet Porwal, a dual degree student from the MTH department, cites four major reasons for this phenomenon, the first being a historical hangover. “Mathematics was always offered as a 5 year program before Y11 and following the example of successful seniors is natural in such a case. Even though this effect is eroding with time but there are companies which hire only dual degree students from this department, which brings us to the second reason, placements. Mathematics has continued to perform exceptionally in placements, and the extra year gives more exposure to the subject and the opportunity to explore others as well, through electives. Thirdly, some students also use the extra year to eclipse their lacklustre UG CPI by working hard for a year and making the PG CPI respectable. Last but not least, some students have a deep interest in the subject and the exemplary faculty at IIT Kanpur invites them to stay a year longer since it is a much cheaper option than going abroad.",
      "Speaking on the same topic, Alok Ranjan, a dual degree student from ECO believes that it all started with the first batch that had the option of graduating in four years. “At the end of 4 years, when they were preparing for placements, they found themselves competing with the previous batch who had studied economics for 5 years. Considering this a disadvantage, most of them chose to pay respect to tradition and opted for an extra year. The same scenario repeats every year and this trend perpetuates itself. The MS curriculum for ECO is not as rigorous as other departments in terms of thesis and credit requirements, and this makes the decision to stay back easier. Added to this the fact that students are free to do an extra internship makes the option quite attractive. Another factor, unique to the department is that a lot of economic consultancies and government jobs require students to possess a post graduate degree in the subject.”",
      "The data of students opting for a dual degree type B/C (in a different department/MBA) reveals that only one student each from seven departments chose this option. This probably shows the lack of awareness or motivation to study an alien subject for an extra year.",
      "",
      "If we look at the total number of dual degrees, ECO attracts the largest number of students. Prof. Deep Mukherjee from the Department of Economics shared his opinion on this. “First and foremost, the saturation of ‘pure’ engineers in the job market today pushes people to acquire specialised skills that could possibly differentiate them from the crowd. A dual degree in Economics produces a very unique skill set which equips students with an understanding of market forces in addition to their core knowledge base. Due to the lack of supply of such students, they are being quickly hired by companies. Secondly, the close relationship between the discipline of economics and engineering fields makes the transition very comfortable. So, if a student has a firm footing in his/her parent engineering field, he/she is deemed fit to enter economics at the post graduate level. This belief is cemented by the presence of numerous role models in the professors of economics in the US who didn’t begin their journey with economics.”",
      "The trends observed in the double major data reflect the overwhelming obsession with CSE.",
      "",
      "Out of the 13 students who took the option of a double major, 8, which translates to 67%, chose to complete it in CSE. All the three students from MSE chose CSE as their second subject while 2 out of 3 in CE chose the same. This trend is stronger in branches like MSE and CE probably because they are notorious for the lack of core job opportunities. So, students try to supplement themselves with more in-demand skills. This view was corroborated by Anshul Goyal, a Y12 student who graduated this year with a B.Tech in MSE and double major in CSE.",
      "Data shows that the EE department holds the distinction of graduating the most number of students in all the programs except PhD, where Chemistry pips it year after year.",
      "",
      "Prof. Debabrata Goswami from the Chemistry department told Vox Populi, “The present faculty strength for EE is 41 versus that of 30 for Chemistry. However, there is a large number of graduating MTech students in EE, who would also require faculty research commitments. A typical faculty in Chemistry would try out the small scale problems with the limited MSc research resources and requirements that they get and they would save up their larger problems for their committed completion with the PhD students.  On the other hand, it is possible, due to the more involvement with Industry and faster timeline issues, a typical EE Faculty would want to address problems more suited to the MTech students. This could be the reason for this interesting statistics. Nevertheless, it is heartening to note that Chemistry has the largest share of the graduating PhD students from IITK.”",

      "In a historical and pioneering step, IIT Kanpur established the first ever Department of Economics among all the IITs, about a month ago.Earlier, what people knew to be the Economics department at IIT Kanpur was not a department per se. It was a part of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) department, just as Microelectronics is recognised as part of the Electrical Engineering department. Since it was the only field within HSS to offer an independent degree, it had it’s own DUGC Convener. All this will now change as the campus gears up to welcome a new department.",
      "Prof. Joydeep Dutta was appointed as it’s maiden Head of Department (HoD). Prof. Dutta, a mathematician turned economist, explains how an economics department fits in a technological institute, the dire need to have one at IIT Kanpur, the immediate effects and various positives of this remarkable step. Following are the excerpts from ourtête-à-tête with him.",
      "Need of the hour",
      "When I was the DUGC convener, I noticed that many students who went for higher studies abroad or to any other university, wrote Dept. of Economics, IIT Kanpur in their CVs. Although the DoAA allowed this practice to continue to give more opportunities to students, the institute did not recognize any such department, which created an issue.",
      "The identity of students and faculty is of prime importance. If any new professor of economics joins the institute, he would like to be in Economics Dept. rather than the HSS Dept. Every subject has its own niche.",
      "The growing interest of the students, which is reflected by the increase in dual degree applications and JEE cutoffs, was another factor. We had around 600 students demanding ECO minors last time. But with such a small faculty strength, it is not possible for us. Being independent will allow us to have larger number of faculty members and avail better resources.",
      "Fitting into the System; Definitely not a Mismatch",
      "Establishing the ECO department was not an overnight task and involved consultations with several institutes.(IIM Indore, TIFR and a professor from Stanford).At IIT Kanpur the department won’t focus on journalistic economics but the modern mainstream economics. It has links with computational game theory (computer science), sustainable development (earth sciences), transportation engineering (civil engineering) etc. I realized it myself when I shifted to the ECO department in 2014 (then under HSS). Hence, economics is very well placed within the structure of this technical institute. In the future, we would like it to be one of the major interdisciplinary departments of IIT.",
      "Immediate Effects",
      "There will no longer be any economics courses offered as HSS courses as part of the lottery. These will be available as OEs. Moreover from Y17 batch onwards, ECO 101(Microeconomics) will be taught as a compulsory course to 1st year students, for half the students in 1st semester and the other half in next.",
      "Several Positives",
      "With more faculty members, we will be starting interdisciplinary programmes one to two years down the line. Moreover, a huge number of good applicants have come forward for the faculty positions, which never came earlier. We have become a pioneer in the sense that many other institutes will be thinking of doing the same now. In the future, we will try to call top level economists and policy makers, even the Nobel laureates for institute talks.",
      "PHDs",
      "We believe the quality of Ph.D. students we get will improve very quickly. We have planned measures for that too. For example, we will start hiring only in June and stop hiring in December. A proper course structure will be set up. We will also be hiring some visiting faculty members (who shall come for short period e.g. 6 months).",

      "The campus community was recently shocked by the most audacious theft racket in the recent past. The sheer number of thefts, mostly of laptops, occurring in the campus within a span of about two months baffled many. On 2nd June, much to the relief of the entire campus community, Prof. Manindra Agrwal, the Deputy Director, sent a mail informing everybody of the racket being busted. Vox decided to delve a bit deeper into the episode and here is what we found.",
      "[Thursday, 1st June 2017]",
      "SiS Security Guards stationed at Hall X, noticed a suspicious person climbing the boundary of the hall and decided to follow him. After a while, they cornered him and questioned him regarding the nature of his business, to which he confessed to stealing a laptop on that day and nothing more.",
      "He was handed over to the law enforcement agencies for further questioning, where he revealed that he is a worker in the mess of Hall VI (GHT). He further revealed that he was working under the directions from the mess supervisor of the same hall which led to the lost laptops being found.",
      "The kingpin and some of the operatives, belonging to Bara Sirohi village, were caught and are presently in custody of the law enforcement agencies.",
      "Let’s go back to when it all started and trace it back to this bust…",
      "[Sunday, 2nd April 2017]",
      "One of the earliest incidents in the series of thefts, two rooms in Hall III were ransacked when the unsuspecting residents went out for some work-related matter, leaving the room unlocked.",
      "[Monday, 1st May 2017]",
      "One room in Hall II was wiped clean of the wallets, laptops, mobile phones, chargers and even earphones, when the unaware residents went out for lunch in the hall mess, leaving the room unlocked.",
      "[Friday, 26th May 2017]",
      "One laptop was stolen from the PK Kelkar Library when the rightful owner of the laptop went out for to get some snacks.",
      "[Wednesday, 31st May 2017]",
      "It was movie night in the quads of Hall IV. A theft occurred in a room, when the resident went to a washroom in Hall IV. He reported the theft when it came to his knowledge. A SiS patrol vehicle was sent there, on the lookout. It’s driver went on a loo break near the bridge by the boundary between the swimming pool and the hall of residence and noticed a rice bag (jhola). The stolen items (from that day itself) were recovered from the bag. Apparently, the thief had thrown the bag outside the boundary wall and was alerted by the guards.",
      "This incident led to the theorizing of the fact that mess workers could be behind this.",
      "[Present]",
      "Combing operations have resulted in the recovery of 13 laptops and few mobile phones, of which 10 laptops have been identified by true owners to establish their ownership. Further, 2 laptops along with a mobile phone were sold in West Bengal, while another was sold in MP. Law enforcement agencies are coordinating with the state administration of these states to recover and bring back the same. IIT Security section is collaborating with law enforcement agencies to facilitate the return of the items to the legal owners. The owners of the stolen items are yet to acquire their lost belongings, which they will be getting back after almost two months.",
      "…",
      "The most surprising part of this whole episode was the cunning with which the thefts were planned. The perpetrators scaled up the boundary walls of the hostels, avoiding the main gate as far as possible. They used 5 kg rice sacks to carry the laptops and other articles stolen, often carrying pliers and other tools to break open locks if required. Then they used to loiter around in wings, with a possible alibi of picking up utensils (supported by thejholas), cold drink bottles and other such articles.",
      "The rapidity and perfection with which the entire episode lasted, that too for over two months, was probably one of the most challenging cases faced by the institute administration, especially the SiS office. With the reputation of SiS guards and campus security on the line, they acted with the institute authorities and student co-operation with great alacrity and dedication to reinforce the belief in tight security in the campus.",

      "Ashutosh Ranka, President, Students’ Gymkhana, had presented a proposal for health insurance of IITK students earlier this year. Primarily, the proposal aims to have a policy through which the students have access to a genuine mediclaim for treatment in hospitals all over India. The senate had formed a six-member subcommittee to investigate this matter. The new policy will supersede the current one and it may increase our annual fee by Rs 350 (approx). The advantages for this extra cost were discussed in the 8th Special Meeting of the Students’ Senate.",
      "The institute will soon release a tender inviting general insurance companies which are licensed and registered with IRDA (Insurance Regulatory Development Authority).The insurance companies are expected to have arrangements with an extensive network of reputed hospitals all across the country for treatment with cashless facility. About 63 preferred hospitals in Kanpur have been enlisted for the same.",
      "Vox Populi contacted Amit Ranjan, a member of the subcommittee. He shared some insights into the specifics of this tender.*",
      "The new policy shall cover every student of IITK and his/her spouse. It envisages a corporate buffer (a clause where the employer i.e. IITK takes an additional coverage and extends the coverage to employees on a case to case basis such as accidents)of Rs 40 Lakh with family floater (the maximum portion of corporate buffer a person can avail) of Rs 5 Lakh per student. In addition, his/her  parents should also be covered under accidental insurance scheme to the tune of  Rs. 5 lakhs. Some of the salient features of this policy include the coverage of day care procedures  such as dialysis, radiotherapy, K-wire fixation etc. Under the scheme, any expenditure in the IPD/OPD of IITK Health Centre shall be eligible for settlement. In case, any student is referred to an outside specialist doctor for consultation, the expenditure incurred shall also be reimbursed. There is no age limit for the insured individual covered by the scheme. The student will have to submit a claim within 45 days of discharge from the hospital and should be settled by the insurance company within 30 days of submission. The payment will be made directly to the insured. For any delay in the process, an interest of 2% p.m. on the reimbursement amount has to be paid by Insurance Company to the student. A claim cannot be lodged for bills up to Rs.250.",

Health Scheme) recognized, public undertaking, autonomous, municipal and private hospitals across India shall also be eligible for the settlement.",
      "The tender is yet to be floated. This will be followed by sessions with the bidders for the tender after which an insurance company will be finalised. But a major step has been taken by the Students’ Gymkhana to improve the health insurance policy for the students on campus.",

      "With the recent surge in a change of attendance related policies in IITK, Vox Populi thought that it was an ideal time to initiate a discussion among the campus community about this topic. we interacted with some people from the faculty and student community, who had varying perspectives on this topic. Below is a summary of what people shared with us.",
      "Ideally, attendance should not be compulsory, but if there are less than 50% students in 90% classes then there is a problem. Someone needs to crack the whip.",
      "Today you are a student and your job is to study and go to classes and if you don’t do that then you find excuses for not giving your 100%. But 40 times over 40 courses, it becomes a habit. You become a ‘makkaar’. Tomorrow you’ll do that at your job, then as a husband, a parent and so on",
      "If students feel that they can pass the course by watching videos on the internet then we need not be a residential campus! We may very well shut it down! The whole idea is that the interaction between faculty and students will lead to learning skills that might not be possible otherwise. But without students in the class, how is that possible?",
      "I am not saying biometric is the answer. I say the solution is to jack up the number of Fs, quenching the feeling that one would pass even without studying, hence students would pay more importance to academics. Otherwise, we are making a generation of shirkers!",
      "Attendance is important when you are schooling when you are dealing with people who are not adults. I think students should have the freedom to go to festivals, dictate their lives, but with full freedom comes full responsibility.",
      "Making the things compulsorily can never be successful. What would one do by taking attendance? Give marks for it? Instead, I think it is better is to keep an absolute limit for scoring in an exam below which you fail. So if you are below 40% in a course, even if the average is 45%, you fail. I believe that just by coming to class, one can score 40% and it is my responsibility to make sure that the exams are such that 40% of the exams requires only attentiveness in class. This should be enough of a stick to guarantee attendance.",
      "If you make attendance compulsory then people will find a way around it too, just like JEE. They will come to class and sleep, they will not pay attention and what is the point then? You want brains in a classroom, not just the bodies.",
      "First of all, students come here as adults andI am not here to police them. You don’t police adults, they should take their own responsibility! It is not the responsibility of an individual instructor to develop work ethics. It is the students’ job to be disciplined. If they don’t have it, then they must develop it or suffer.",
      "In case the faculty is not able to fulfill his job well, then students should talk to him, rather than bunk the lectures, which is the easiest way out. Here in IITK, if the students step forward five steps, the instructor shall definitely step ten, but the initiative has to be of the students. They spend a huge amount of time on Techkriti, Antaragni, Galaxy, etc but not even a tenth of that time is spent on academics.",
      "If a teacher gives a lot of time to prepare for a lecture, a meager response not only discourages him but also decreases his incentive to work harder for the course. I have seen this happening in front of my own eyes in IITK! Attendance is something that lies in the hands of the instructor, not the students. But if I take it, it would be for some other purpose.",
      "The notions of freedom and democracy are frequently associated to IITK. It’s what makes us different from our sister IITs. Attendance for lectures not being there is also part of IITK’s culture",
      "So, if I am asked that whether an instructor’s incentive should depend upon the number of students attending classes, then I would say no, it should not. That being said, I also don’t mean that the instructor should feel motivated while taking a class of mere 5 students. But this is just one-half of the story, you need to consider the other half as well when changing a policy.",
      "Our system is built for freedom, for students to go and experiment, to do what they like in the way they like and that is why excellent students came out from IITK. But when students don’t have this tool, the excellence may start going down. We should see that attendance is not just a stand alone issue, it is so inherent in our culture that it is entwined to many other things. Changing it, we’ll have to change a lot of things and I don’t think if people will be happy to live with them.",
      "Going by the culture that has been present in IITK, I don’t think attendance should be made compulsory. But if we go by the vision of the institute, then academics is central. It’s the reason we came here and if students are giving more importance to other activities, then the institute has the right to have compulsory attendance.",
      "What I see today is that the incoming batches aren’t doing much. Their representation in campus activities is low and even academically, they are not doing well. Believe me, I have seen students who don’t know their course number on the day of their midsems. IITK in the past has seen students who did well academically, even after serious participation in extracurriculars. The system used to provide them with the flexibility to do so.",
      "If the professor doesn’t teach well, students should go and raise their voices. They should complain to the DUGC, the SUGC, but that again needs participation. Everyone needs to understand that complaining from outside will not do anything. Hence I believe if they are not doing anything then at least they should attend the classes.",
      "I believe we must have a moderate compulsory attendance policy (e.g. ~ 60-65%). The aim of the institute is to create leaders in science, technology, industry, business and more. To achieve that, we need to have an atmosphere where the students receive the necessary fundamental education to build foundations and have ample freedom to pursue independent innovation.",
      "People say students are adults but think about it, the argument does not fly in various other “adult” or “professional” settings. (Imagine telling your boss you are an adult and hence can show up to work whenever you want to) Some might be acting as adults but that could be checked by policies like having a minimum necessary attendance till the mid-semesters which can be waived off on a good performance in the course for the next half of the semester.",
      "Now coming to the point that IITK’s culture has been one of giving freedom and liberty to students, the answer is plain and simple. Culture changes.  IITK of now is not the same as it was in it’s prime and the only way we can reach those heights again is to participate and improve our academic system.",

      "The Women’s Cell of IIT Kanpur was constituted in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 as stated on its website. The Cell’s mandate includes sensitizing the community towards gender-related issues, and in this regard",
      "The Cell also advises on available courses of action to women on campus who may be in distress.",
      "The body of women’s cell constitutes the following members:",
      "The creation of the Women’s Cell in its current form was somewhat shrouded in controversy. In the words of Prof. Mohua Banerjee, “After the Act, in 2014, the former redressal committee (Women’s Cell) was replaced by the Internal Complaints Committee (henceforth referred to as the ICC), retaining the Chairperson and the Vice Chairperson. A lot of hue and cry ensued, because[1]the former Women’s Cell had done a lot of good work.The administration wanted to separate the case-handling and awareness-creating bodies, so they disbanded the old Cell, created the ICC (for case-handling), followed by the commissioning of the Women’s Cell.Hence, in addition to the ICC, the Women’s Cell was founded, which wouldn’t deal with cases but rather with awareness and sensitization of the community. Both bodies work for the welfare of allfemalemembers of the campus community – faculty, staff and their family members and students.”",
      "A notable feature of the composition of the Women’s Cell is the fact that there is almost equal representation of both genders and representation is provided to all sections of the campus community – faculty, students (UG and PG) and staff. The members, however, have been appointed and there has not been an official nomination/election for the same.",
      "The most notable activity of the Women’s Cell, IIT Kanpur in recent times has been the launch of itswebsite. The website contains details of the current team of the Women’s Cell, a description of its activities and some important features ofthe Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 which everyone should be aware of, for example, explicit definitions ofvoyeurismandstalkingand how they constitute punishable offences under law.",

      "A slowly unfolding chaotic mess of incomplete information, erratic errors and temperamental tantrums, the OARS surely creates a place for itself in the hearts of every student who has ever used it. Time and again, we realise the multiple ways in which it is inadequate, despite there being multiple ways in which we are adequate to change it.",
      "The last preregistration season witnessed quite a lot of drama with the OARS shutting down every now and then. As a result, we received multiple mails from the DoAA regarding guidelines to handle the OARS, and had also witnessed a deadline extension of around a week. Many members of the faculty had come out citing their concerns against it, some in rather humorous ways, and there was also a surge of memes mocking it. Facebook pages like Humans Against OARS quickly gained traction as they resonated with the feelings of the entire student community, as well as the instructors. So, we decided to have a look at the various diseases that plague it, so as to better understand the causes.",
      "",
      "(Image courtsey :Humans Against OARS)",
      "Going through the information available on the OARS website, we came to know that it was created in the year 2001 by a group of students from the Department of Computer Science under Prof. Phalguni Gupta. It was initially designed with a handling capacity sufficient for the students of the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Departments. The system involved using the Oracle database used by the Undergraduate (UG) office as the back-end. Modifications were made to that database and the front end was created in ASP (Active-Server Pages). PL-SQL programming was used to reduce load on the ASP engine and put it on the Oracle server instead. The entire page is built on HTML frames, and is incompatible with HTML5.",
      "At the OARS office, we learnt that the current system is handled by Mr. DC Mishra, and a group of engineers and technicians from the Computer Centre. Mr. DC Mishra also happens to be heading the development of the new OARS. Here is what we learnt from our conversation with him.",
      "VP:Why is it so slow?",
      "DCM :If the server is hit more that 50 times in a day with the same IP address, it marks this address as spam, and restricts it, which is the usual reason why it is perceived to be slow. This is due to existing firewalls in the system. A tradeoff has to be made between reducing system security and increasing the performance of the server and hence the firewalls cannot be removed entirely. Further, the presence of a virus scanner makes the server slow, turning off which restores the speed.",
      "Also, the system had a defective RAM, which was supposed to be of 64GB, but functioned as a 16GB one. This has been replaced by a 128GB RAM now, which would hopefully make the process much smoother next time.",
      "VP:Why does it work only through Internet Explorer?",
      "DCM :It is difficult to write code for every page to make it compatible with every browser. Even if this is done, it would make it incompatible with the older versions of IE. With around 70% of the professors still on the older IE version, it becomes rather difficult to make the shift. However, we are updating it, and parts of the website are now accessible on Firefox, though only for professors.",
      "VP :Is there anything new in the pipeline?",
      "DCM :We expect to come out with an improved OARS by the end of February. A variety of algorithms are being considered to make the process student friendly and more flexible. The following are most likely to be implemented in the new system-",
      "We are also in the middle of talks with the DOAA and the Students’ Senate to decide on the minimum number of students to register for a course.",
      "",
      "Another new development in this regard was intimated by the President, Students’ Gymkhana, Ashutosh Ranka. In his recent status update on Pingala he said, “The team will now be picking up work on DoAA modules, with a priority given to the OARS module. Hopefully, we will see an alternate to OARS available in the next semester!”",
      "With the next preregistration season approaching soon, we hope that the improved OARS will be up and about, making the entire process much more hassle free. Let’s wish loads of luck to the entire team, for this is going to be one output for which we can’t wait any longer!",

      "Over the past few years, the number of nominations, for both Senate and Executive positions, have steadily decreased. During this general elections, the condition worsened, leaving the governance body short of volunteers in two major departments, FMC and the GnS. While there were no applicants for the position of GenSec, Films and Media, Mr. Tizil’s nomination for the GnS post was cancelled on grounds of violation of the Code of Conduct. Last year, the executive post in the Cultural Council was left vacant and Mayank Jain, the FMC GenSec, had to perform dual roles for half the term. With the by-elections being held for the vacant posts, there has still not been a nomination filed for the post of GenSec, Films and Media.",
      "Surprisingly, this year, there was only one candidate who filed the nomination for the post of President, Student’s Gymkhana, which is often considered the most valuable POR in our institute.",
      "(Red – Nominations decreased from previous year,Green – Nominations increased from previous year)",
      "This trend can be observed in Senate positions as well. The number of nominations for the first year UG batch decreased by a staggering42%. The overall trend over the years can be seen in the graph below.",
      "The graph clearly indicates the number of nominations have hit a new low  (data for 2013 was not available)",
      "This stark decrease in enthusiasm for the nominations in senate may also be reflected in the constant fall in the number of votes over the years. Voter turnout had been around 45% till 2015 but has fallen even more in the last two years. This year’s turnout stood at a lowly 27.11%",
      "",
      "Not only has the number of candidates reduced, it has also spurred people less serious to contest, ultimately resulting in a below par Student Governance Body. This year, some candidates for a position in the Senate submitted blank manifestos because they were the only applicants.",
      "The process of election is supposed to be the way people choose from among themselves, representatives who voice their collective opinion and provide solutions to their problems. They present a manifesto, highlighting the major points of their candidacy, on which people may later hold them accountable. The submission of blank manifestos undermines this responsibility severely.",
      "A few years ago, when elections were fought with fervour and charisma, it would have been inconceivable for a candidate to give in a blank manifesto. “When I contested in my first year, there were so many candidates from our own hall, that the HEC had to filter us based on our manifestos! This (submission of blank manifestos) is very surprising”, said Samarth Bansal, a Y11 graduate.",
      "The rules, though, clearly state that a candidatemustsubmit a manifesto. But they don’t impose any restriction on the content (or the lack thereof). Ayush Pathak, the Chief Election Officer, says that the only requirement for candidates is to not refer to anything outside of their manifesto while campaigning. Since the blank manifestos were submitted where there was to be no election, it caused no problem to the candidate.",
      "In the face of reduced nominations, the fear of the candidate withdrawing his/her application kept the EC from forcing them to submit a well thought out manifesto. “We are doing everything we can to welcome more nominations. In the first Senate meeting this year, it was decided that the fees be reduced to a nominal amount and several other steps taken to ensure that there are more nominations in the future”",
      "Vedant Goenka, Chairperson of the Senate, has a different perspective, one he derives from massive experience in the Senate. The manifesto, he feels, represents the candidate’s vision but the process of a proposal becoming a reality is long and tedious; and even when the reform does materialize, it is often difficult to trace the person responsible. “The criteria to hold a Senator accountable cannot be the manifesto, not belittling the importance of one”.",
      "Perhaps, the only measurable parameter to judge a Senator’s performance, he feels, is his attendance and participation in Senate sub-committees that are formed for various agendas. “That is what a senator is supposed to do. Represent the views of the junta and work on suitable reforms.”",
      "But the jarring reality is that most of the Senate’s time is spent on routine tasks instead of taking up reforms. A current Y15 Senator (who wished to remain anonymous) believes that the knowledge, of the way the Senate is forced to function, drives nominations away. The potential candidates start believing that their proposals cannot take shape from a Senator’s position. “At the end, you find yourself going to meetings that last hours just to discuss festivals, their finances and organisation.”",
      "It seems as if thejuntahas lost faith in the system. It’s the whole vicious cycle; fewer nominations, less serious Senators, below par Student Body, lack of measurable output, the disillusionment of the junta, lesser nominations still.",
      "Either way, the situation is that currently thereareSenators who have not gained their position by a well-fought election or by the clarity of their vision; but by the simple fact that no one else bothered to apply. Whether they do their job or not, we would definitely be watching them closely.",
      "Given all that, the Senate does valuable work and cannot be abandoned. It is also important to note that there is an enormous power vested in this body. If we are able to achieve a fully functional Senate, it could bring a lot of positive changes. So, going forward, what is the role of the Senate? And how can it break free from this chain? These are questions that it should be asking of itself.",

The proposal to increase the cap on participation was presented by the festival coordinators of Techkriti ’14 and not Techkriti ‘16. This proposal has been accepted by the senate with some modifications. Melange is organized by the President, the executive for General Affairs Council and not the Presidential Council. The amount for students’ research convention may be raised from Student’s Activity Fund and from the institute.",

      "Reaching the world via Outreach cell",
      "A proposal was raised by Ashutosh Ranka, President, Students’ Gymkhana to create a student body named ‘Outreach Cell’.The vision behind this program is to build a positive and attractive image of the institute in the eyes of the alumni, the corporate world, potential faculty, aspirants and the society.This would help to improve the student-alumni relations and spread awareness about institute’s academic and nonacademic activities.",
      "Some plans for this proposal include organizing Open House for UG students just after JEE results. The Outreach Cell will also publish short videos, blog posts and newspaper articles to disseminate information about the institute. Further, they intend to create a common website for alumni, students, potential faculty and visitors. The website will provide comprehensive information about the activities of the institute and its alumni. It will integrate the future-students website and the Quora blog.",
      "The initiative will be carried out in coordination with the Information cell, Media and Publicity Centre, Alumni Relations office and the DoRA office. This would help in pushing the content generated continuously through offline media (newspapers, tech magazines,etc.) collectively at an institute level.",
      "The proposed internal structure of the cell consists of three wings, namely, creatives, content and public relations. Senator Vipul Garg argued that the cells should only have executives and not heads in its initial year as they won’t have much work. It would be unfair to those who hold similar position but are doing more work. The senate rejected Vipul Garg’s argument and passed the report.",
      "“Censure” turmoil hits Parliamentarian",
      "In the 6th Special Meeting of the Student’s Senate, a censure motion was proposed on the floor of senate against the parliamentarian. A Censure motion is a formal expression of severe disapproval, passed against an authority, for one’s failure to perform his/her duties. The motion was proposed against the Parliamentarian, Ayushya Agarwal, for misinterpreting the constitution of student’s gymkhana in a special session which was organized with the incoming senate for the selection of Chairperson, Student’s Senate 2017-18. During the special session, an argument was raised regarding the legitimacy of the nomination of Shivam Mishra who was a candidate for the post of Chairperson. Allegations were made that Shivam Mishra, who was a senior election officer for the general elections 2017, could have ‘influenced the elections’, and thereby could have also ‘influenced the senators’. When the parliamentarian was asked for his interpretation, he declared Shivam Mishra ineligible for the post of Chairperson and cited ‘conflict of interests’ as the reason behind his decision. The case was taken up in the Student Senate’s 6th special meeting where senator Harsh Narang proposed for a censure motion against the parliamentarian. The proposal was not passed by the senate, as out of overall 19 votes, 7 votes were in favour of passing of the motion compared to 12 votes against the motion.",

Melange is the annual inter-pool competition organized by the presidential council. Kunal Kapila argued that it should have been considered while formulating the gymkhana calendar. Ranka replied by stating the unexpected change in the academic calendar which caused a one-week delay in the ongoing semester.  The senate agreed to scrape melange due to a jam-packed schedule.",
      "Deliberations to increase the cap on participation of Techkriti’17",
      "A proposal was presented by Mohit Pandey, festival coordinator, Techkriti ’17 to increase the cap of participants in Techkriti this year to 2100. Currently, the cap is 1800 for full accommodation and 500 for open fest. Mohit Pandey supported his proposal by highlighting the recent infrastructural development. 300 more individuals can be accommodated in the available space, the breakup being 60 in GH 2 and 120 each in hall 12 and 13. He mentioned the increased participation in Techkriti, with 16 cities being visited in Technocruise as compared to 8 last year and 21 cities being visited in TOSC as compared to 11 last year. The festival coordinators of Techkriti ’16 had proposed an increase to 1800. The senate wanted to discuss it further and has not passed the proposal yet.",

      "Mayank Jain, General Secretary of Films and Media Council answered the senate that he intends to disclose the results of Spectrum along with Galaxy. He took this special measure to ensure every pool participates with complete enthusiasm in the remaining GC events. He feared prior announcement of results would dishearten the pools and they won’t put their cent percent efforts.",

It will be conducted on the 8thand 9thof April 2017. It aims to provide a platform for students to showcase their research work, to promote a research-oriented profession and provide opportunities to the students to interact with leading researchers in various fields.",
      "The ARC shall invite students and professors from prestigious institutes across the country such as IITs, IISERs, IISc, NITs and some other local institutes. The convention shall host talks by research scholars of IIT Kanpur. There shall be oral and poster presentations. Local industrialists, startups, SnT clubs and institute’s research labs shall be invited to set-up exhibitions.Workshops on soft skill development and other vital skills like machine learning, finite analysis, advanced linear algebra shall be conducted.",

      "The E-cell, proposed ‘The Student Entrepreneurship Policy’, a set of guidelines and policies that may promote entrepreneurship on campus. This proposal was taken up by the senate in its 9th meeting conducted on 31st January. The policy was presented as an agenda item in a senate meeting last year but was then kept on hold. This time it was passed by the student senate after some edits and now waits to be discussed in the academic senate.",
      "The senate had a lot of discussion on a point, according to which the institute is supposed to have about 2 percent equity in the company, in return of facilities like department specific labs, an office, and legal advice to company owners whenever required. The senate was divided on its views on the issue. Many accused it of being mere exploitation of the student entrepreneur as he/she may not wish to use the institute provided services and hence is not bound to pay, while others stood by the view that the owner, in any case, would be using such services while he is on campus.In addition to that, the proposal states that a student has to operate with the campus incubation centre unless a justification is provided to the authorities for not doing so. Once associated with the institute, the institute would exercise its discretion in several areas. Liability free 2 percent equity is supposed to be arranged till the founding student is living on the campus and using the institute provided services. Several guidelines have been presented concerning the share of faculty mentor and funding for the company, which could be provided by the institute as a loan or as a part of the equity in the company if the company desires so.",

      "‘Heralding the 21stcentury through automation, Pingala promises to be a one-stop solution to all our procedural requirements.’",
      "Pingala is a massive project undertaken by the New Office Automation (NOA) team, set up by the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, IITK. This long term project started in the month of April last year, with a vision to automate all of the administrative procedures in the institute.  The database required for the project has been provided by ‘Team Computers’, a startup by an IITK alumnus, Ranjan Chopra. ‘Pingala’ is named after a little-known Indian genius who formulated the first binary digit system. This project has a lot to offer for everyone – faculty, office staff and students.",
      "The project will be implemented in three phases. Presently,Phase Iis underway, which primarily deals with procedural and accounting requirements. The NOA team has set a target to complete it by the end of this year.Phase IIwill be primarily for the unique requirements of the Dean of Academic Affairs (DoAA) and the Dean of Research and Development (DoRD). It consists of 46 modules and will take another 6-8 months.Phase IIIhas as many as 63 modules dealing with requirements such as Gymkhana, Placements, IWD (Institute Works Department), RTI (Right to Information), Health Centre and many more. The third phase will take another 8-10 months. The team, however, plans to start the work of the third phase parallely with the second phase.",
      "",
      "The modules that have already been implemented in Phase I classified according to user base:",
      "Complaint Management System– This is similar to the complaint management system of the IWD (Institute Works Department), but with a much better user interface and added features. The process to lodge a complaint is pretty intuitive and the correspondent has had his problems resolved within two days.",
      "Library automation–  This module aims to implement a comprehensive procedure for issuing and returning books. It can be accessed atlibserv.iitk.ac.in",
      "Letter forwarding– This portal has been released already. It can be used for multiple purposes, most importantlylecture hall bookingandissuing transcripts. For every procedure, a workflow shall be defined by the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA). The user simply needs to submit his letter/proposal, which shall be forwarded to all the persons mentioned in the workflow. The user may track his/her application using a reference number and once the procedure is complete, he/she will get a mail to collect the required document/permission from the concerned authority.",
      "Faculty Recruitment System– Primarily for the heads of departments (HoDs), it is useful for submitting and shortlisting applications. It also facilitates compilation of tasks done by the HoD, so that they can be taken over by the nominated representative in his absence.",
      "Task Management– This will be used by the faculty members and class I employees, It will allow them to create new task, assign them to students and staff and track there developments.",
      "Committee Formation– In this portal, presently to be used only by well-defined institute committees such as SUGC and SPGC, the Chairman, Secretary and approval authority are defined. This portal can then be used for convening meetings, setting agendas, collecting feedback on agenda and convening the final meeting. It also has features that allow managing leave applications and appointing nominees.",
      "Address Book– The Address Book module is meant for official purposes and is made available for the Deans and other senior office staff. It shall help them maintain all their contacts and a visiting card for all official purposes.",
      "Online Survey– This module, as the name suggests, can be used to create general surveys on the entire campus community. Initially. this shall be open for faculty only. Later, it shall be made available for students. The survey can be circulated among specific groups like student groups, course groups as well.",
      "An archival module is also being developed for the departments, where they can maintain an archive of students’ personal records, important documents and other valuable resources. Important office orders will be stored directly in the archive. The concerned persons will be sent an email regarding it, and they may choose to share the order with any other individual through the common archive. This module shall be completed once the more fundamental modules are ready.",
      "Once fully functional, it will indeed make student life at IITK a lot easier. Such procedural improvements are indeed noteworthy and commendable. Vox Populi wishes luck to the NOA team. May the project be up and running in full swing by this year.",

      "The General Elections for the year 2017 concluded last week. A rather dull and controversial election season saw the Election Commission take up various new initiatives in an endeavour to have a greater reach among the campusfraternity.",
      "One of the major highlights of this year’s elections was the idea of conducting executive dialogue and debates via Facebook live. Ayush Pathak, the Chief Election Officer (CEO), 2016-17 said, “The live streaming of the debates and dialogue fetched a good viewership with an average Facebook reach of over 4,500.”",
      "Though the idea of Executive Dialogue was quite successful, campaigning on Facebook using video manifestos drew flak, particularly related to font size and content arrangement. In response, the CEO said, “The implementation of the idea by the candidates was mediocre. We advised them many times but still various mistakes were committed by the candidates because the idea was the first of its kind. But it still garnered a great response from campus community as well as alumni. I believe it will definitely be successful in days to come.”",
      "This year for the first time, a card free voting system was organised. However, according to the EC, the success rate was about 70% due to data not being available with the Office Automation system.",
      "Major changes in the Code of Conduct included a decrease in the fine amount and a change in the pattern of the SoP Box. Till now, cross questioning was not entertained, neither from the panel nor from the public. This time, the SoP Box had a lot of cross questioning, which ensured that ambiguities of any sort were clarified.",
      "Another significant change was an increase in the campaigning period from 5 days (all working days) to 7 days (including two holidays). This was a big relief for the candidates as they could comfortably space out and plan campaigning in hostels.",
      "A few ideas from the pre-conduction report, however, were not implemented by the EC. One of them was releasing posters in all halls informing people about the functioning of the senate. The CEO said, “It wasn’t implemented as planned but the collaboration with TedX, IIT Kanpur team made the posters more amusing. A number of online posters were also released. An interesting display of posters was implemented on the polling booths notifying the voters about NOTA and General Elections.”",
      "There was a conspicuous increase in activity of the Election Commission with many new initiatives. However, all efforts were marred by a very dull election season. There was a significant decrease of nominations as compared to last year for various Senator positions due to which elections were conducted only for Senator, BT/BS Y16 and MSc (2yr)/ MSc-PhD Y16.",
      "A more severe issue, however, are reports of a major decline in the voter’s turnout. The exact details shall be revealed in the next Senate meeting. This is definitely a major point of concern both for the Students’ Gymkhana and for the entire campus community.",

      "Biometric attendance was started in the second semester of the 2015 – 2016 session, based on feedback from both students and faculty for 2 – 3 courses. It was implemented for a few courses in the Summer Term last year, in the 2016-17 (I) semester and in 4 – 5 courses in 2016-17 (II)",
      "The objective behind taking biometric attendance is to make sure attendance takes place efficiently and with the least disturbance possible. To quote the DoAA, “Many faculty members want to give some weightage to attendance. Now it is not possible to take attendance manually for large classes of over 400 students. This shall facilitate the same. Also, IITK is a residential campus and biometric attendance would allow the campus authorities to be aware if the students were in the campus, as after all, they are the custodians of the students and are answerable to their parents.”",
      "The DoAA reassured us that there is no proposal for an institutional policy requiring compulsory attendance. He said, “Whether the attendance is compulsory or given weightage in grading is dependent on the instructor. I personally believe attendance ensures that the learning process and academic environment is preserved. Some students may be capable of achieving good grades without regular attendance, but IITK is not a factory to provide grades. Here we inculcate an academic environment, and every student has certain responsibilities.”",
      "Biometric attendance is definitely a good implementation of existing technology to increase efficiency of procedural matters and promote ethical behaviour in campus. According to our DoAA, there have been no major implementation problems and hopefully, as soon as more equipment is acquired, biometric attendance will be used in more courses.",

      "This is an entry received for the freshers’ writing competition for the topic : My Expectations from a Gender Unbalanced Society in IITs",
      "I am always reminded of this single incident when someone talks of gender imbalance in IITs. A friend of mine, at the start of our orientation, told me that he was lucky to have a girl’s roll number next to his because he gets to sit beside a girl during the sessions. The probability of this happening, he reasoned, was 1 in 10; considering the incoming batch had 50 girls against some 800 boys. ‘Fortunate indeed’, I mocked him at the time. Within days, I realized how the ‘1 in 10’ thing made a difference. There was something strangely unsettling about this. If there is one place where the minority, and not the majority, has the upper hand, gender is it. And as a member of the majority gender, I have my reasons to worry. In any social unit, however small, the less populous gender is always the one that enjoys all the perks. The majority cannot afford to be choosy or selective.",
      "It is known to all of us how limited female interaction hampers emotional development or how it affects wrongly our attitude toward the opposite sex. And it won’t be just the boys who would have limited female interaction; girls would have to face the issue just as much. A lone girl in a batch of some 150 odd boys is no rare sight in our college. The girl will crave female interaction, as would the boys.",
      "In any unbalanced society, interaction between opposing factions – the minority and the majority – is dismally low, even lower than what the statistical figures might suggest. The reason, essentially, is the fact that the minority has a subconscious sense of insecurity and therefore tends to form circles of its own instead of integrating with the majority. Don’t get me wrong – I don’t mean to say that the girls in our college feel insecure with boys. Consider this – if friend circles are formed without a gender bias, a group of 17 will comprise a single girl, which is ‘awkward’ at best. The girls therefore tend to stay in groups within themselves, no matter how many ‘cognizance’ sessions are included in our orientation.",
      "No matter how bad the things are, they can always get worse. My expectation concerns just that – I don’t want this gender imbalance manifest itself in ways that puts to question the very idea of ‘human development’ in IIT Kanpur. A senior of mine told me, during our orientation days, that I should be friends with a girl here. I assumed he wanted me to strike a balance between male and female companionship. But as it turned out later, the reason was something totally different. He said that we would be having a scavenger hunt as part of the inter hall competitions and girls would come handy during that as we might have to scavenge for girlish things, like a teddy bear or a hairdryer.  This is where, he told me, the significance of a girl ends for me. “You won’t need to know a girl afterwards”, he said matter-of-factly. For a moment, I wondered if it was this unbalanced gender society that had shaped the attitude of my senior to the extent that for him the only significance a girl had in our lives was helping us win a treasure-hunt. This, precisely, was the kind of manifestation I was talking about. Aren’t girls as much a part of our society as the boys, and aren’t they just as much important?",
      "It happens very often that people who grow up in limited female companionship turn out to be indifferent to female emotions, which in time develops into even more serious issues like misogyny etc. As a boy I know there are things male companionship cannot offer- some of them not as obvious as the others. No matter how much of a bond I share with a male friend, I don’t go crying to him when I miss home, or when I miss someone – such things are seen as ‘too girlish’ in male circles. It is this case of emotional attachment that female companionship gets all the more important. In a similar sense, I expect the girls to keep their feminine charm intact, which is not very easy when you are surrounded by the opposite gender all the time. I hope that everyone – a boy or a girl – has a fair share of female interaction.",
      "I expect no one to be ‘craving a female companionship of his liking’, if I may put it so. I remember how during our senior high school – even though things were much better (around 25% of those taking JEE are girls) – boys would often complain how difficult it was to find a like-minded girl because the number of girls was dismally low (or was it?). One thing that gratifies me now is that despite the fact that the number of girls is awfully low, we share a common ground with them – we study the same technical courses. That is to say, all of us are like-minded in a broader sense. So even though we can’t be choosy at all, chances of us striking a bond with someone are high.",
      "There’s no way we can change the demographics of our college in the immediate future, but we can learn to live here without feeling ‘unblessed’. To be honest, it is my male brethren that I am worried about when it comes to gender imbalance. They are the ones who feel ‘unblessed’ because of the dismal sex ratio. I want them to stop whining about it. I want them to stop mocking the ‘IIT Girls’ as they usually do, thereby further alienating them.  I want a single girl to feel at ease in a group of 16 odd boys. I don’t want to reach the stage where I suddenly start ‘feeling lucky’ just because I happen to sit next to a girl. In this gender unbalanced society, I hope that we strike a balance somewhere.",

      "This is an entry received for the freshers writing competition and submitted written for the topic : My expectations from a gender unbalanced society at the IITs",
      "“Come out of the closet.",
      "It’s not so dark anymore.",
      "Look at the trees out there!",
      "What are you waiting for?",
      "We haven’t travelled all this way so you can snore and dream!”",
      "We all dream how the world ought to be. We acknowledge that gender bias is wrong, don’t we? So then where do we falter? I cannot generalise and answer for us all, but I can look within and share.",
      "Firstly, I shall clarify the title. Anya is not my imaginary Russian friend. She is a personified concept or a frame of reference (for us physics buffs). Simply put, she stands behind you, at your blind spot, and knows how you are defined in the context of the world. In all my intellectual capacity, I try to be her. This way, I can understand how my actions affect the world and how the world affects me.",
      "When I first came on campus, I was terrified! I had never been in such a heavily skewed gender community all my life! How would I fit in? What would my friends say if I talked to a girl? What would I do if I needed a woman’s perspective on things (shiver shiver)? On my third day here, while I was playing my guitar, I was greeted with requests. Requests to teach a bit of guitar, so that one could approach a girl and be friends. Really? Wouldn’t it be easier to just talk?",
      "It seems like a lot of us are eaten up by desperation. I don’t deny it, but would chose to define it in a different way. As a PHI142(Logic) student, I would say:",
      "If all desperation is yearning,",
      "and all yearning is the absence of love,",
      "desperation is just absence of love.",
      "Wow. Now, I have to define love, don’t I? Tricky business, writing an essay. For simplicity (and not escapism), let’s say that love is a dimension which humans don’t understand yet. It’s that warm feeling in your tummy when you lie down. Everybody wants some! Since I defined desperation as absence of love, what sort of love are we missing? It’s so easy to love others, but I want to love who I am because if I do, I can build myself. This construction of self requires a bit of both worlds. Remember that your sex doesn’t define you, you define it.",
      "Now, I think I should clarify why Anya is feminine. I simply made her this way, so that when I think about my place in the world, I think romantically. Romance has earned a very sad reputation in recent times. Cinema and literature have eliminated its true meaning. This is how Google defines it: a quality or feeling of mystery, excitement, and remoteness from everyday life. This quality or feeling is often associated with the feminine and I just need a dose of it occasionally. So, are guys missing femininity? If so, why? Whoever told you that femininity  is a trait of womanhood was very very wrong. It doesn’t make you less of a man to be soft and emotional once in a while. I try hard to fight this social dogma and would die to see you fight with me. This is what I expect from the campus community. Don’t fight the world on gender bias. Fight yourself. If you listen closely, you may hear the trees swaying in the wind and the leaves dying to break free. Please, exist!",

      "Day 5 was the happy homecoming the Kanpur contingent was waiting for. Besides grabbing the top two positions in Pole Vault and the second spot in 1500m, we also won the 4X100m Men’s relay against all odds.",
      "In men’s 4x100m relay, we were up against Delhi who had in their ranks, Dileep Pudi, the Meet Record holder for 100, 200 and 400m events. Mohit gave us the steady start we needed before Waghela and Jorwal built the lead. Pranav finished off the race with a brilliant run as we pulled one over Delhi.",
      "It was a repeat performance for Delhi’s Rahul Jhajharia and Kanpur’s Jaswinder Singh in the endurance event, 5000m race, as they stood 1st and 2nd respectively. Rahul has managed to stop the Jassi juggernaut throughout the event. Deepak Meena, Kanpur’s other hope, missed the 4th spot by 2 seconds.",
      "In shot put women, Kanpur was represented by Kavita and Priya, both of whom could not break the top 4. The same was the case for our 4X100m women’s relay team as they finished 6th.",
      "Pole Vault was our most assured performance in an athletics event yet. We were miles ahead of our competitors and both our participants broke the previous meet record of 3.35m. Anurag achieved a height of 3.60m without breaking a sweat and Sagar finished at 3.40m.",
      "Badminton",
      "In an exciting match which won the hearts of everyone present on court, Kanpur won 3-2 to win gold. The first singles match was held between Rohit of Kanpur and Srinivi of Madras. Srinivi was in full control of first set till score was 20-14. After this Rohit went on rampage to take the scores to 20-20, but after this lost it 21-23. Rohit avenged the first set defeat by winning the next two sets 21-11 and 21-13. The second singles was held between Gopichand of Kanpur and Soham of Madras. It was an exciting match in which none was ready to give even a single point to the other. Gopichand lost the first set 22-24, claiming the second set 21-18 and losing the last set 17-21. With this Kanpur and Madras were tied 1-1. Next, the doubles match was held which was won easily by Rohit and Palash of Kanpur 21-14, 21-14 in straight sets. This took Kanpur ahead 2-1. In the next singles, Abhinav of Kanpur lost to Vignesh of Madras 21-17,15-21 and 20-22 in a three set match. This took the score to 2-2. After this, the second doubles was held. It was played by Abhinav and Gopichand from Kanpur’s. Soham was the star player from the Madras side. Kanpur won the first set 21-12 easily but lost the second set 18-21. The third set was tied at 20 each. As overall the score was tied 2 all and set score was tied at 1 each. The last set scores were also tied and gold for badminton was to be decided in the next few moments. Everyone’s heart was pumping fast, be it a professor or student. Even members of other teams who had lost earlier from these teams couldn’t contain their excitement. This time everyone had witnessed a level of badminton not seen in the tournament so far. Even after this no team was ready to give points and the score went to 22 each. But after this some classic shots from Gopichand stole the match from Madras and they won it 24-22 and hence gold for Kanpur. The level of competitiveness can be judged from the fact that normally a match generally lasts 2 hours whereas this lasted more than 4. Almost every match was decided in last set and in some cases, even till the last point.",
      "After the impressive show of the men’s team now was the turn for the women’s team to add to the tally. The first singles match was a face off among the top seeds of their contingent. The former Inter-IIT gold medallist, Priya started off on shaky grounds as her rival won points effortlessly in the first set though her injury posed a serious threat to the continuation of the game. Priya looked wobbly, her game lacking the lustre of a titleholder though her opponent played with aggression and pulled through some brilliant smashes and forehand and backhand lobs to take the first set 21-18. The second set wasn’t any better for Kanpur as Kalyani took a 7 point lead halfway while Priya was trying to get her rhythm back. Post break, she did manage to reduce the lead bringing the score to 13-15 but Kalyani’s skills were unmatched as she went on to win the match 2-0.",
      "Next up was the doubles match. The Bombay duo of Kalyani and Payal overcame the advantage taken by Kanpur at mid break with some sharp drops and net play winning the set. The subsequent set witnessed some tiring rallies and desperate short combinations from the host team but Bombay’s game strategy and team work worked like charm as Payal’s sideline smash finished the match in jolly style. The Bombay team took the title winning both the sets 21-14, 21-12.",
      "Basketball",
      "Kanpur beat Delhi 46-42 in a thrilling clash to win bronze in women’s basketball. Both teams opened their points tally with a 3 pointer and went on to play neck and neck in the first quarter with Kanpur scoring 16 points and Delhi 14. This quarter saw three 3 pointers, two by homegirl Sonal and one by Delhi girl Mallika. The next quarter saw a superior game by Kanpur. The girls played in cohesion and put up a strong defense which forced a lot of errors out of Delhi. Kanpur’s Chanchala played an aggressive game, intercepting the ball in defense and cutting through the Delhi defense and scoring in offence. Kanpur’s Avani also chimed in causing a few turnovers and making some excellent passes. Kasturi did a good job at being the centre, taking up rebounds and shooting with accuracy. Two baskets by Kasturi along with two 3 pointers by Sonal again in this quarter helped Kanpur close the quarter at 30-23. Delhi closed the gap in the third quarter, by scoring 15 points and conceding just 8. Delhi’s Apoorva brought the situation under control by scoring three timely baskets which included one 3 pointer. Kanpur’s accuracy took a hit in this quarter with Delhi grabbing all the defensive rebounds. At 38-35 with Kanpur on the lead, Apoorva’s 3 pointer closed the third quarter at a level 38-38 . Things had started getting exciting by now. The last 10 minutes would decide who returns home with a medal and who does not. A few minutes into the final quarter, both teams scored a basket each to reach 40-40. This was closely followed by one basket from Delhi and two from Kanpur. With 30 seconds remaining in the game, and Delhi trailing 42-45 the referee declared a timeout. After play resumed, Delhi made a foul and an injured Chanchala got 2 foul shots out of which she bravely converted one and earned the crowd’s respect. This took the final points tally to 46-42 in favour of the home team.",
      "Cricket",
      "The much awaited final of the religion of the nation was played at the ACES ground. Delhi won the toss and chose to bat first. The Delhi openers gave the team a steady start, as they had been for the tournament till date with their star batsmen, Moolchand, scoring 29 runs. The first fall of wicket for Delhi was when they were at 34 runs. The turning point of the match was when Vikrant from Kanpur scalped both Kumar Sahaj and Moolchand. Neeraj Meena was the highest scorer for the away team and overall with a score of 31 runs. At the end of 18 overs, Delhi had reached 102 runs. The 19 over, bowled by Nitin Sharma was a beauty, giving only 2 runs. Finally the target set by Delhi for Kanpur was 110 runs. Nicku Nitish and Vikrant, came in to bat but Kanpur lost Vikrant in the first over itself. After this shaky start, Nicku and Sanchit stabilised the innings with a 50 run partnership. After losing Nicku, Vaibhav Yadav, who scored a blazing 54 against Delhi when they faced each other the last time, came in. The match was safely in Kanpur’s hands at the end of the 16th over when they needed 18 runs of 24 balls. But then, Amit Meena’s run out and the unexpected loss of Nikhil Srivastava made it interesting. Finally, a four by Vaibhav saved the day and brought home the Gold for Kanpur.",

      "Football",
      "The stage was set for the semifinals and Madras was Kanpur’s opponent. The match started with Madras edging ahead in the first few minutes but producing no clear cut opportunities. Kanpur hit back after that period with a free kick taken by Manish that resulted in a header similar to the last match. After that Kanpur started dominating the play, as Deepanker sent an excellent through ball for Saurav which he crossed and the goalkeeper somehow cleared. It went as far as Debojit who attempted an exquisite back heel shot but the keeper made a superb reflex save to parry it away.",
      "Kanpur had their best chance when Deepanker’s shot somehow reached Debojit leaving him one on one with the goalkeeper 5 yards away from the goal but he shot it straight at the goalkeeper. The first half finished at 0-0 (thankfully for Madras), with Kanpur missing various guilt edged chances.",
      "The second half began on the same note with Kanpur tearing the Madras defense with ease and yet another golden opportunity was created via a through ball of Mishra to Saurav which he tried to chip over the rushing goalkeeper but it was way off target. The rest of the second half continued with Kanpur having the major share of possession but were unable to break in as fatigue weighed in. 50 minutes finished with both teams level, although Kanpur players must have been kicking themselves for missing opportunities to score 3-4 goals. Both halfs of extra time were more of the same, a match between the Kanpur offence and Madras defense and it went to penalties.",
      "Madras reached the penalties with the experience of having faced them in the last knockout match as well. The first 3 were scored by both the teams in clinical fashion but then somewhat similar to Luis Van Haal in Netherlands’ world cup quarter final, Madras coach substituted his goalkeeper. The 4th penalty was saved by the Kanpur goalkeeper as he dived acrobatically to the right corner. Then it all came down to the 5th Kanpur penalty with tremendous pressure on the Madras goalkeeper but he somehow made the save to take it further into sudden death. Kanpur scored 2 penalties under immense pressure and it paid off when the 7th Madras penalty was missed by Adarsh. Kaustubh took the last penalty and converted it emphatically, making the crowd euphoric. Hence leaving Kanpur on the verge of winning the Tournament.",

Everyone on the field looked determined as the audience anticipated a hell of a match. Kanpur scored as early as in the fifth minute of the game with an amazing flick by the captain from outside the D which was then converted into a goal by Rahul. Kanpur was not able to maintain their lead for long as Roorkee retaliated and scored in the eleventh minute. The half time was marked with a penalty corner being converted to a goal as the hosts once again were on the driving seat. Just when Roorkee was soaking in the last goal, Kanpur captain drove the ball from almost the half field with a final flick into the goal by Pramoth. Roorkee tried to level things with a successful Penalty stroke, which made the match more interesting. Chola and the goalkeeper of Roorkee played exceptionally well in the entire match. Roorkee’s game was mostly based on man marking which is quite a defensive one. The final score stood 3-2 as Kanpur inched closer to a well deserved win. The final match will be played against Delhi for the title.",

So,overall, Kanpur continues its winning streak beating Bombay by 2-1.",
      "Table Tennis",
      "In Kanpur’s first match of the day, the boys were up against a formidable Bombay squad which had already proven its mettle when it emerged undefeated from the pool stage. Kanpur opted for its original team composition which had won them the first two matches of the tournament, resting Arpit and bringing Abhimanyu back into the fold. Kanpur looked to be doing everything right with Mehul winning the first set of his match against Bombay’s top seed, Mohit, but then it all went tumbling downhill and ended with Mohit having won three sets consecutively and hence, the match.",
      "",
      "As was evident from the first match, Kanpur had also reverted to their former match winning strategy of conservative plays, longer rallies and waiting for opportunities to strike after the disastrous results of yesterday’s experimentation but all of it to no avail. Nikhil lost to Atharva in four sets with a narrow win in the second one and a whitewash in the fourth which was followed by a straight sets thrashing handed down to Abhimanyu by Sharang. Bombay always seemed to be in full control of the game, unperturbed by and withstanding the sudden Kanpur point surges and then retaliating in kind, so much so that they twice denied Kanpur four set points to finally claim the set. Bombay won the match with a score of three to none.",
      "The story wasn’t very different for the women’s team as they lost to Delhi by 2-1. Mugdha, whose consistent performance has won her all of her matches in the tournament, defeated her opponent in straight sets but all of it was undone in the next match.",
      "Much to the chagrin of the assembled supporters, Kanpur yet again managed to throw away a comfortable lead in the fourth set and that too when victory seemed well within reach since the team lead the match with a set tally of 2-1. Delhi won the fourth and the fifth sets to win the second match which kept them in contention and gave them a fighting chance in the last one.",
      "Anushya fought hard in the all-important last match but lost momentum after being defeated in two consecutive sets and consequently, was routed in the third.",
      "It should be noted that the poor performance of the doubles’ team has lead to Kanpur’s defeat in their matches against the stronger teams like those of Bombay and Delhi.",
      "Volleyball",

Kanpur switched tactics today, opting for aggressive plays and smashes right at the start of a rally instead of the long rallies they played yesterday and the day before. However, the tactic backfired as it resulted in a net or an overshoot more often than not and this seemed to unnerve Nikhil. Arpit, freshman from Kanpur, playing his debut match in the tournament just managed to win the first set but then lost thrice consecutively to cede the round.

      "On the other hand, the men’s team had to face stiff competition offered by the experienced and talented team from Roorkee in a contest which could well decide which team would emerge as the pool topper. Kanpur shot off the mark with a win as Mehul Singh triumphed over his opponent in the first match, but the score of 3-0 belies competitiveness of the round. The second match turned out to be the most exciting one, pitting Mandeep Singh, captain of the Roorkee team, against Abhimanyu Yadav of Kanpur. Abhimanyu won the first, third and the final game but lost the second and the fourth ones as Mandeep exploited Abhimanyu’s lack of concentration as evident from the many unforced errors committed by Abhimanyu. The third round was a sublime show of skill by Nikhil Sharma as he outclassed his opponent with an awe-inspiring medley of shots exhibiting control over placement and pace.",
      "A member of the Kanpur’s coaching staff banged a chair on the floor to show his excitement post the team’s win.This proved to be a little too much for Mandeep, who must have been perturbed and disappointed with Roorkee’s defeat. Consequently, he had a heated exchange of words with the said person.",

Kanpur regained the momentum in the fourth set and won it 25-12. Sandy continued his form and stole the show today too. He served the ball 16 times in a row along with some amazing smashes during the match. Also, it was a treat to watch Vice-captain Piyush who played consistently well during the match.

However, Kanpur made an exciting comeback and changed the score from 21-16 to 21-25. Former captain, Sandy once again came up as a legendary player by earning crucial points for the team.",
      "Athletics",
      "Kanpur began with a decent showing in the track and field events held in the morning session. In the 100m heats, both the participants, Deepak Jorwal and Mohit Yadav qualified comfortably for the semifinals held later in the day, where both finished third clocking 11.5 seconds and 11.6 seconds respectively. The women’s team did not share their success as both the participants in the 100m heats failed to qualify, coming in 4th and missing the chance to play the semi-finals.",

      "In the men’s 800m race, Jaswinder ran in a league of his own (forgive the pun) and emerged as the clear winner in his heats, leading by a margin of 7 seconds. Deepak Meena also qualified for the finals to be held on 15th.",
      "In short-put, Kanpur’s Shivam missed a podium finish as he stood 4th. But Sachin Salim secured the third position for Kanpur in the Triple Jump event held in the evening.",
      "Football",
      "The journey to the finals began today for Kanpur, with the first opponent being a strong Roorkee side. The first thirty minutes were a complete stalemate with no clear cut chances for either side. The nerves were evident as shown by an early booking right in the 10th minute for Rohit Meena of Roorkee.",
      "But then Roorkee started to get into their groove with some fast, free flowing football led by the trio of Collins, Benjamin and Gebaheyu who caused a lot of problems with their tenacity to win the ball back. Roorkee continued bossing the game, as Kanpur was not even able to get into Roorkee’s half due to some great pressing.",
      "Then came the saddest moment of the day when Kanpur’s Manish and Roorkee’s Vedansha collided leading to Vedansha being seriously hurt and being taken off on the stretcher although thankfully, Manish was back on his feet after the match with some heavy bandaging on his head.",
      "After the play resumed, Roorkee continued to dominate the match with Collins and Gebaheyu combining really well to cause a lot of problems to Kanpur on the right wing. But it all ended with a 0-0 scoreline.",
      "Table Tennis",
      "Home team Kanpur gave us something to cheer about with a dominant performance over a rather drab and lethargic BHU squad early on in the day. First up, top seeds Nikhil Sharma from Kanpur and Shubham from BHU squared off against each other and apart from a little stumble in the third set, Nikhil cruised to a comfortable victory.",
      "",
      "",
      "Mehul Singh outclassed Prakhar from BHU in straight sets to claim the second victory for Kanpur and Abhimanyu Yadav finished off the opposing team in the third match. Kanpur played a clinical game, not giving away too many points while forcing the other team to commit unforced errors after engaging them in long rallies.",
      "Ashutosh Singh, Kanpur’s team coach was visibly pleased and a touch too ebullient after the win and in a candid chat with Vox,  went on to say that this was one of the best Kanpur TT teams thus far and he was confident of a good performance this year all the while emphasizing that other teams are no pushovers. He also lauded Nikhil’s and Mehul’s performance and was optimistic about their run in the Inter IIT.",
      "Lawn Tennis",
      "The women’s team started their campaign today with the first match against Kharagpur. Chinta Hari Chandana won the first set 6-2 against Shambhavi from the opposing team. The next set was initially dominated by Shambhavi who took it down to 5-1, taking advantage of the repeated double faults committed by Chandana. Although Chandana initially struggled in converting her service games to points, she scored 6 back to back points from this stage and snatched away the set 7-5.",
      "The doubles match also went through interesting twists and turns. In the first set, Chandana and Deepika seemed to easily overpower Shambhavi and Bhumika from the opponent team, thrashing them 6-1. But the next set came as a surprise as the opponents made a commendable comeback winning it 6-1. In the tiebreaker that followed, Kanpur restricted KGP to 6-0 initially, after which although KGP went on to score 5 points they couldn’t stop the match from going in Kanpur’s hands",
      "Kanpur took on Gandhinagar for the men’s singles. Sagar Batra represented Kanpur in the inaugural match.  Sagar held his nerves and won the points when it mattered the most. He won the first set 6-3. In the second set Sagar came back much stronger. He broke Aditya’s serve thrice to win the second set 6-0.",
      "Sagar continued his winning momentum in the doubles match in which he paired with Ankush Singh. Sagar Batra impressed the audience with his volley winners. The Kanpur duo hit a staggering 14 winners in the second set. They even recorded the lone ace in the second set. They emerged victorious 6-1, 6-1.",
      "Badminton",
      "The first match for men’s badminton trophy was played between Kanpur and Roorkee in which Kanpur defeated Roorkee 3-1. The first match broke the heart of Kanpur fans as Rohit Chauhan lost 0-2 in straight sets. After that Kanpur won one match after the other giving Roorkee no chance of comeback. The second match was won by Gopichand Kotana of IIT Kanpur 2-0 in a hard fought match with Mayank Sharma of Roorkee. The third match was a doubles match where home team had another easy win in straight sets. The most exciting match of the day was the singles match between Abhinav of Kanpur and Himanshu of Roorkee. Abhinav won the first set and then Himanshu levelled the score by winning the next set 21-16. The decider set was a real thriller where Abhinav who was leading 20-17 gave away 3 consecutive points at a very crucial point but after this Abhinav won the next two points to claim the set and the match for himself and Kanpur.",
      "",
      "Women’s team continued the winning streak for Kanpur, comfortably defeating Hyderabad. They were in no trouble at any point of time and won the first singles match 21-3, 21-5 and the doubles 21-0, 21-7. As a result they dominated Hyderabad 2-0.",
      "Squash",
      "The match between Kanpur and BHU was a walk in the park for the home team. The Kanpur team routed BHU 3-0 with all the matches lasting a mere 70 minutes. Kanpur players had the upper hand from the word go with Tizil Saini beating his opponent by 11-3, 11-2, 11-0. Following him, the other two team members, Vivek and Manraj won their sets 11-1, 11-7, 11-0 and 11-1, 11-2, 11-4 respectively. After such a mesmerizing performance by the Kanpur team, they will surely be arriving with loads of confidence in their match against Madras tomorrow.",
      "Cricket",
      "Madras won the toss and chose to bat first. They played well for the first 10 overs scoring at a steady pace, reaching 57/2. But unfortunately, they suffered a regular fall of wickets after that and lost the plot completely in the last five. The Kanpur bowling attack put up an inspired performance with Vaibhav Pandey taking one, and Vikrant and Nikhil taking two wickets each. But Nitin Sharma stole the show scalping three batsmen.Kanpur had a shaky start losing a wicket in the first ball. A regular fall of wickets ensued but Nicku Nitish held steady at one end. The next shock was two consecutive run outs and in 10 overs they reached 55/4, finally Amit Meena guided Kanpur to victory.Basketball",
      "The boy’s home team kick started their Inter IIT campaign with a comfortable 74-55 victory over IIT Guwahati. An early basket each by homeboy Naman and Aditya from the Guwahati team set the momentum of the game. Sudhanshu Tandon of Kanpur gave a scare to the opposition early on with his lightning speed, swift passes and some very close misses at the basket. As the momentum of the game picked up, the crowd started pouring in in large numbers. A 3-pointer by Tandon and 3 quick baskets by Vikash helped Kanpur close the first quarter at 18-5. Aditya was the only opposition player to beat the Kanpur defence and score in the opening quarter.",

Of the 17 points scored by Guwahati in this quarter, 13 were by Aditya who single handedly kept his team afloat and 4 by Tarun. On top of this, they restricted the host team to 16 points despite all free throws being converted to goals and some near perfect lay-ups by homeboy Aditya Parmar. At the end of the second quarter, the scoreboard read 34-22.The third quarter was dominated by Kanpur again with Shivam Chaubey clinching 11 out of the total 23 points scored by Kanpur. A miraculously long pass by Chaubey followed by a quick goal by teammate Mohit set the Kanpur crowd roaring and left the opposition dazed. The only 3-pointer in this quarter was scored by Guwahati boy Rishi. Tarun helped Guwahati score a respectable 16 points in this quarter by converting 5 of his free throws to baskets. The quarter ended 57-38 in Kanpur’s favour.The last quarter saw neck and neck competition between the 2 teams with both scoring 17 points. Kanpur boys Aditya and Sachin successfully converted 2 foul shots each and Sudhanshu scored his second 3-point shot of the match.",

The ceremony was held in the Main Ground and began at 4 PM.",
      "",
      "The event commenced with the Inter IIT flag being hoisted by the chief guest and the other dignitaries. The contingents’ fight for points began with the opening ceremony as they prepared for the march past, the first event of the meet. The 23 IITs marched in alphabetical order with Bhilai leading the march and Kanpur, the host at the back as tradition demands. It was a sight to watch both the strength of the 150 strong contingents of older IITs and the resolve and determination of newer and smaller contingents to make their mark. Dharwad entered the competition with the smallest contingent, consisting of 4 members and Kanpur with the most populous at 146. The all important tunes of the march past came from the 14th Sikh Light Infantry band, stationed at Kanpur Cantonment.",
      "The General Secretary, Games and Sports, IIT Kanpur, administered the oath to all the participants in the sports meet, promising to abide by the sportsman spirit and to play to the best of their abilities.",
      "Next, the symbolic torch run was completed on the track with four groups of three members each completing the circuit. The runners have all created a mark on the IIT Kanpur sporting scene and brought laurels for their institution. The first group had Rama Satya from volleyball, Vaibhav, a cricketer, and Anil Bisla from Aquatics. They handed the torch to Mainak Majumdar, captain of the football team, Vivek Dubey from Squash and Prabhu from Hockey. Next Ritesh Giri of the weightlifting team, Anisha Thomas and Manish carried the flame. The final lap was completed by Sonal Yadav, M Surya Prakash and Robinson Guria of the basketball, Athletics and weightlifting teams.

      "The dignitaries then proceeded to share their thoughts on sports and Mr. Jhajharia and Mr. Bhati shared their specific experiences as olympians. Mr. Devendra Jhajharia recounted his tragic accident which led him to lose his left arm and the dedication which took him from practicing with a homemade wooden javelin to a world record holder in the sport. His journey from district champion in 1996 to world record holder in the 2004 Athens Paralympic Games was a continuous journey towards excellence. But the highlight of his career has been breaking his own record in the recently concluded 2016 Rio Olympics. He praised sports as a discipline for inculcating the values of unity and will power. He remarked jokingly that seeing the trophy on display on the podium, he felt like competing with the IITians right away. He implored all IITians to take inspiration from his story and to keep the service of the nation as their primary goal.",
      "To conclude the programme, the Enthrall group, a professional acrobatics group ‘enthralled’ us with their gravity defying stunts. The audience watched in awe as they performed flips and jumps with no props or safety nets.",
      "The results of the march past were announced after the conclusion of the event and Kanpur and Roorkee shared the top spot with multiple ties for the second and third place.",

      "With a history almost as old as the institute itself, the Dhobi Ghat of the campus could be well seen as a place lost in time and circumstances.",
      "As one enters the area, they are greeted by a narrow brick path strewn with cow dung that goes ahead meandering through colourful shacks, many of which are roofed only by tin sheets. Hundreds of bamboo cloth stands shoot up from the tall, unkempt grass in the encircling ground. Water streams through the dozen washing tubs. Standing under a kaleidoscope of colours created by light streaming in through the hundreds of cloths hanging around, watching kids carrying piles of jeans as they smile back at you, it is difficult to accept that one is still inside the campus of IITK.",
      "",
      "However, Dhobi Ghat seems to be deep rooted with problems. The melancholic tales of everyday life as recounted by the Dhobis echo cries of negligence and indifference, and clearly depict the state of deep distress in which they have been living here all this while. Cows and bulls merrily amble by, wrecking cloth poles and people alike on their way. Pests abound the place, with snakes and scorpions inhabiting the grass the children play in. The Dhobis complain of the infrequent cutting of grass by Institute authorities. To verify their claim, we visited the IWD and confirmed from them that grass cutting in Dhobi Ghat is done once a year only. Garbage lies heaped in piles all around the place. The place stinks and living conditions look pitiful.",
      "The Dhobi Ghat is a strange place. There are some families who live in Type-I quarters while others live near the ghats. Initially, the dhobis near the ghats, each had one room allotted to them. Gradually as their families grew, they built temporary rooms with thatch and mud, entering which we were appalled to see the battered interior condition. Some of those rooms have ceilings at only six feet height and they are poorly lit by kerosene oil lamps. Electricity for them is so near yet so far. We also stumbled upon a larger truth – these “houses” had no bathrooms attached to them. As it is difficult to build a sanitation system without proper outside help, these people decided on doing away with toilets in their houses, and have been defecating in the open all this while. The dangers of this much discouraged practice need no elaboration. And to mitigate these, they have designed their own system of warning methods, and go to the lengths of ensuring that at least one member accompanies children and family elders when it is dark. The thought of living here even for a day sent shivers down our spine. We are unable to provide basic amenities to residents in the very campus that aims at producing cutting edge research and entrepreneurial advancements.How these people continue to live here is a big surprise, that too when they have the fear of getting evicted any time.To quote the Chief Executive Engineer at the IWD, “These people have illegally built temporary constructions in the area. They can be evicted any time, but the institute does not plan to do so as they have a strong support group in the numerous faculty members and students of the campus.”",
      "",
      "Despite such a plethora of difficulties, their only major concern remains the installation of washing machines in the students’ hostels. This is seen as a capitalist decision, and the ability of washing machines to thoroughly wash clothes is thoroughly questioned. They go on further to describe the thoughtful techniques applied by them to the age old process of washing clothes. Whether it be the care taken in the segregation of different colours, or the careful craft of skilfull hands of an entire family in removing dirt from the intricacies of fabric, one cannot help but laud the efforts put in by the dhobis in ensuring that the campus community wakes up to a clean closet of crisp clothes. They take pride in the execution of their trade and labour throughout the day and remain one of the background tracks of the music of the campus.",

      "There is nothing as satisfying as having a thorough meal of tasty food. Luckily, our campus will soon be providing many more opportunities to do so! The CEMMC (Commercial Establishment Management and Monitoring Committee) has finalized the establishment of a diverse group of food joints to take care of our taste buds.",
      "The construction ofUrbanCraveis already underway. Scheduled to open up at the New Shopping Centre before Antaragni, this restaurant will roll out delicacies of a variety of cuisines. It offers hand tossed, wood fired pizzas, live nitrogen ice creams, wraps, sandwiches and much more! So if you are bored with the CCD menu, then this will keep you busy for some time. And with the added plus of a 7% discount, it sure will fulfil the cravings of continental fare.",
      "UrbanCravewill be serving both non-vegetarian and vegetarian food, as may be expected. But for the veggie lovers of our campus, finally a decent restaurant is coming to IITK by the name ofPandit; which is something along the lines ofHaldirams. It offers an assortment of tastes, all prepared without onion and garlic. During festivals, it will have the option of a Falahari Thali for those who undergo fast.",
      "Panditwould open at the Old Shopping Centre beside the Nobel Book Store. The deal is finalized and construction is expected to begin soon. Its presence will sure give theCampus Restauranta run for its money; which itself has come under heavy fire.",
      "According to feedback from a survey, the campus junta is dissatisfied with the quality of food that has been steadily falling over the years. TheCampus Restaurant’s contract expires on 30th November and the chances of renewal wear thin. To fill this void, a good quality non-vegetarian restaurant can be launched in the Old Shopping Centre. The CEMMC is in talks with a few and we may see one finalized in short time.",
      "A recurring question that has been posed over the past few months is, “Subway: Is it coming already?” And the answer to that is as convoluted as it gets. “Probably.”",
      "",
      "We have had an on again-off again relationship withSubwaythat puts Ross and Rachel#to shame. But without embarking on the long treatise of our taboo love, it would suffice to say that talks have been resumed and are almost at a conclusion. The designs have been accepted, a site visit is in the offing and construction is expected to begin next month! If all goes to plan, we will be eating a foot-long in January from their humble abode in the New Shopping Centre. (a discount of 7%)",
      "For the faint of heart (and light of pocket), canteens suffice to provide the escape from mess food, that we all desire. Renovation of the Academic/DoAA and CC canteens is in progress. Both of them have been tendered to Pandit. We hope to taste the change soon.",
      "These advances add new flair to the banal landscape of campus food. The spirit and zeal of CEMMC, to bring us this plethora of fares, must be applauded. Hopefully these plans will be realized soon and save us the long trudge to the city for quality cuisine.",

      "The last day of the aquatics meet started with Siraj Modiwala of KGP and Anil Rulaniya of Kanpur shooting off to a thunderous start in the 200 meter men’s backstroke, but Siraj shrugged off the competition in the 3rd lap to claim gold while Anil bagged silver and Gtanshu Bhatia of KGP won the bronze.Bombay and Madras continued their brilliant run with Ashish Kanhere from Bombay and Anuj Sindagi from Madras claiming first and second spots respectively in the 50 meter men’s backstroke, while Indresh from KGP finished third.",

Bombay girl Kavya Kumar won bronze.Yesterday’s star performer, Anand Krishnan from Madras cruised home to win the gold in the 100 meter men’s freestyle, while Dhritiraj Das from Delhi and Samarth Bhagawat from Bombay came in at 2nd and 3rd respectively.The last of the scheduled swimming events,the 4×100 meter medley relay, turned out to be an absolute cracker. The starters of Madras propelled them to a massive lead which they managed to hold out for 6 laps only to lose it to Bombay in the 7th. Bombay were themselves involved in a close contest with the team from KGP in the first few laps but managed to relegate them to third position.Delhi made a late surge to finally overtake KGP, which earned them the third position. Not content with just a win, Bombay pushed themselves even harder to clock 5:02:28, shattering the previous meet record by one and a half seconds.The pre-final aroma was in the air as Bombay took on Madras in the 3rdplace playoff. Could Madras trump Bombay like they had in the pool stage? It seemed that way, as they raced to a 2-0 lead in the first quarter. But it was once again Bombay’s strict defence that played the part. They did not concede any goal in the second and fourth quarter; building pressure that helped them score. By the time the match was over, the scoreboard read 10-5 in their favour. Abhishek Shinde scored 7, Ashwin netted 2 and Arijit put one way. The Madras breakdown continued as Bombay took home the water polo bronze.And finally, perhaps the most eagerly awaited event of the meet – the water polo finals between Kharagpur and Kanpur. An impressive turnout by the campus junta ensured an almost electric atmosphere. The first quarter was characterised by a frequent exchange of shots between the two teams, which gradually increased in their accuracy and aggression. Kharagpur managed to find the net twice in this quarter, while Kanpur’s chart remained unopened, though not for a lack of trying.Kanpur then opened the second quarter with an immediate goal. Neither side turned down the heat, and both managed to score two goals apiece after a ferocious exchange of shots.The third quarter was where Kharagpur truly began to up the ante. A tight formation ensured that Kanpur was unable to pierce their defence, with most of their shots either going wide or being blocked. Notable also was Arshil Abbas’s goalkeeping for Kanpur, which kept the aggressors at bay with great effectiveness.The terse last quarter saw both teams score three goals apiece. Kanpur finally began to match the aggressiveness of their opponents, but it was a little too late. The match ended at 9-6 in favour of Kharagpur, nail-biting to the last minute. KGP lads, Aman Kharb, Pradeep Grewal and Abhishek Dhahiya score two each while Siraj Modiwala managed to evaded Arshil thrice. For Kanpur, Raghav, Vihang and Vasu found the back of the KGP net twice each.

      "The third day of the meet which saw a new meet record being set, started on a rather bewildering note. The absence of many contestants from the 100m butterfly heats forced a combined heat.",
      "The highlight of the day was when CK Anand Krishnan of Madras cruised home with a new meet record of 26.81 sec in the 50 meter men’s freestyle, ahead of Dhritiraj Das of Delhi and Samarth Bhagwat of Bombay.",
      "",
      "Resurgent hosts Kanpur also claimed 2 podium finishes  with Pookundam Saruanan and Anil Rulaniya coming in 2nd and 3rd respectively behind Siraj Modiwala of Kharagpur. The 50m women’s freestyle was a close fought  battle with L.R. Kamala Devi of Madras finishing just before Kavya Kumar of Bombay, who came in 2nd and Vritika Bagudia of Delhi finished 3rd. To go by the stats, the gap between 1st and 2nd was just 3 hundredths of a second.",
      "Yash Malviya bagged another medal with gold in 200m men’s individual medley while Poonkunduran came in 2nd and Singdhi Anuj Milind of Madras came in 3rd. It was Yash Malviya again as he raced ahead to claim the first position in 100m butterfly. Maharnab Mitra of Roorkee was 2nd and Arijit Pramanaik came 3rd. Finally to wrap it all up, Sneha Aiswarya, Oindrala and Prutha from Kharagpur won a hotly contested 4X50 meter women’s freestyle relay. Bombay and Madras Finished 2nd and 3rd respectively",
      "In the last pool stage match, Roorkee needed to pull off something unbelievable. But it seemed that their hopes of qualifying were dashed prematurely as Madras raced away to a 5-0 lead in the first half of the match. They regrouped in the third quarter, holding the scoreboard to 6-1 and in the final quarter they nearly pulled off probably the greatest comeback in Inter IIT history. They scored 3 goals in quick succession, leaving Madras reeling under this onslaught. However, it just wasn’t to be as they bowed out of the tournament with a 7-5 loss.",
      "With this, Madras topped Pool B and set up a semifinal date with Kharagpur. Kanpur would have to square off with Bombay and it promised to be a ripper.",
      "Come evening, the promise was realised. Inyetanother draw, Kanpur came from behind to level scores with Bombay at 5-5. The first quarter was representative of the match. Both had scored twice and the atmosphere was electric. But Bombay started to pull away in the second when they held Kanpur and netted two. The tensions were high as Kanpur chased the game from 4-2 down. Amidst chants of “Kanpur! Kanpur!”,they created strong chances and Bombay’s defense finally gave in.",
      "",
      "",
      "The penalty shootout, that followed, was a dramatic affair. Kanpur missed the second shot to fall behind but Arshil Abbas, the home goalkeeper produced two brilliant saves and even scored on his chance to turn the tables! Kanpur never looked back from there and won 9-8 and the celebrations began.",
      "The second semifinal was nothing like the first one. It was shockingly one sided as Kharagpur neutralised Madras 12-1! From the start, KGP ruled the pool like usurpers, denying Madras every attempt at goal. They scored consistently except in the second quarter, which was a dry period in the game. Abhishek scored 5, Aman 3, Siraj netted 2 and Gitanshu and Pradeep scored one each. Madras had dominated the Pool stages but they fell short in the knockout. Kharagpur produced such a dominant display that Kanpur would do well to be wary.",
      "Finally! We are down to the last two; Kanpur and Kharagpur are the finalists like in the 2014 Edition. We hope the match is the cracker it was when last they met.",

      "Day 2 of the 32ndAquatics Meet, held at IIT Kanpur, followed the example of the inaugural one. Madras and Bombay’s dominant streak continued as they took away the podium finishes in most of the races. Delhi and Kharagpur managed to take a piece of the pie too.",
      "The winner from Madras, Anirban Nag, maintained a colossal lead in the first 10 laps of the 1500m Freestyle but Delhi’s Aditya Kotiya fought back courageously but was unable to catch up. Bombay’s Arijit came third in this exhausting event.",
      "Kanpur’s performance in the swimming events was lukewarm on day 2 with Manthan Sit coming in at the 5thposition in the 100m breaststroke event. Bombay’s Ashwin Kanhare picked up Gold while Madras boys Anuj and Sriram bagged Silver and Bronze respectively. Anant Vats came 6thin his event, the Men’s 50m Butterfly. In this short race, it was Delhi’s Dhritiraj and Yash who took home both the Gold and the Silver. Maharnab Mitra of Roorkee came in third.",
      "",
      "In the 200m Freestyle, Madras’s Ananda Krishnan scored the first position, closely followed by Bombay’s Samarth and Delhi’s Aditya. Homeboy Ishank Modi, floundered a good start, as he finished 6th.",
      "The only event for women today, the 50m Butterfly saw Delhi’s Bhakti take the Gold that she had fought so hard for yesterday. Prutha of KGP stood second and Bombay’s Kavya finished third.",
      "The drama though, was reserved for the water polo matches. The first match was a one sided affair. Madras won 7-1. Throughout, Guwahati searched for the net; finding it only in the last quarter. Madras produced a clinical performance; scoring their first goal within the first minute. The pace slowed thereafter as the midmorning heat took its toll. There was a controversial moment when Guwahati’s Ajay got injured and claimed that he was kicked underwater.  He may have sustained a fracture and we wish him a speedy recovery. C.K. Anand scored 4 goals, Adit scored 2 and Sriram found the net once for Madras.",
      "The second match seemed to be going for a close finish when after the first half, Roorkee led Bombay by 3-2. But thereon, Bombay stepped on the accelerator by playing an attacking game; even the goalkeeper came forward occasionally. They reaped rewards for their courageous play, scoring 7 goals in the last half. The final scoreline read 9-4 in favour of them. Abhishek Shende scored 6 goals for Bombay; Abhas scored two and Ashwin netted one. This match left Pool B in a precarious situation, as both Bombay and Roorkee had won once. The last match of the day, however, made matters clear.",
      "Kanpur vs Kharagpur; the clash of the titans, as it was termed by some, proved to be just that! We witnessed the first draw of the tournament as the final scores read 8-8. Both teams went neck to neck, the ferocity of the attack matched only by the veracity of the defence. Kharagpur trailed by a goal till the last quarter but they drew level, finally. Siraj scored 5 for them while Vihang found the net 4 times for Kanpur.",
      "",
      "As a result of this draw, Kanpur topped Pool A on goal difference; much to the satisfaction of the capus junta who had turned up to watch the game.The last match of the day was important for Bombay as they needed to win to remain with a good chance of qualifying. They did just that; beating Guwahati, for whom the match was inconsequential but important to save face. Guwahati did well in the first half drawing level 4-4, but as has been the story this tournament, the 3rdquarter proved to be all important. Bombay scored 3 goals; maintaining a strict defence that did not allow Guwahati to score. The final scores were 8-4 to Bombay. Abhishek Shende scored 6 (again!) while Kedar and Ashwin scored once for Bombay.This guarantees them a SF spot. Madras had already qualified. If Roorkee beats them by a goal difference of greater than 9; only then can they qualify. And with the form Madras is in, it seems unlikely.It was undoubtedly an exciting day, and as we head towards the finals of the water polo matches, tomorrow, can only be better.",

      "For the swimming heats and time trials held in the morning, Madras and Bombay dominated throughout. In the 400 meter freestyle time trials, the timings were far from the inter IIT record set by Akshay Krishna. Aditya from Delhi, Anirban from Madras and Arijit from Bombay finished first, second and third. Kanpur lad Anant Vats finished 4th and got his team one point to open the scoring for Kanpur.",
      "",
      "In the 50 meter women’s backstroke heat, Delhi came agonizingly close to Madras with a time gap of less than a second. In the 200 meter men’s backstroke, Nikhil Mohan of Roorkee was disqualified for a false start and had his hopes crashed early.",
      "The most interesting event of the morning was 4X100 meter men’s freestyle relay. The Madras team consisting of CK Ananda, Anirban, Raghav and Vishal maintained a colossal lead in the first two laps but Abhishek, Arijit,Tarun and Samarth from Bombay fought back bravely to lose just by a few strokes. It is only befitting that a match as close as this deserves a place in the history books. Madras made a new meet record of 4:25:47. Bombay stood second and Delhi comprising of Dhriti, Gaurav, Yash, Aditya secured third.",
      "In the evening, the finals for the heat events were conducted. The 50 meter backstroke women’s final was closely contested initially between Gayathri of Madras and Bhakti from Delhi. With the progression of the event though, Gayathri developed a handsome lead. Vrittika from Delhi finished behind Bhakti and secured third.",
      "",
      "The 100 meter men’s backstroke finals had two Kanpur lads Poonkundran and Anil Rulaniya competing for glory. They both managed podium finishes with the final standings being Siraj Modiwala from Kharagpur striking gold and Poonkundran and Rulaniya finishing second and third respectively.",
      "In the 200 meter breaststroke finals, Manthan Sit was the only Kanpuriya featuring in the lineup and secured 1 point by finishing fourth. Manthan had managed to surpass both Sriram and Sanjay from Madras but lost the lead as both of them finished second and third with Ashwin from Bombay finishing first with a healthy lead that he took from the start.",
      "The 50 meter breaststroke finals saw huge cheers for Kamala from Madras who was the favourite. She didn’t disappoint and beat the rest convincingly. Pooja Yadav who was representing Kanpur finished eighth.",
      "The water polo matches were held after the morning session and then late in the evening. Delhi had to unfortunately face two strong opponents, Kanpur and Kharagpur on the same day. To say that the matches were a treat to watch, is an understatement.",
      "Kharagpur took on Delhi in the morning at 11 am. It was a strong show for KGP as they thumped Delhi by 12-0. Though Delhi created many chances, they could not convertanyof them into goals. Aman Kharb, Siraj Modiwala, Pradeep Garewal, Abhishek Dahiya scored 3 goals apiece for Kgp. This must have had an impact on the Delhi morale and their second match held in the evening.",
      "",
      "The second match, fought between Madras and Bombay was a tight one. After the first two quarters, Bombay led Madras by 3-2. But Madras bounced back strongly to win the third quarter; scoring 3 goals. They never looked back from there and eventually went on to win 7-4. Adit scored one and Anand scored two for Madras. Their star player, though, was Sanjay, who scored 4 goals but was injured in the last quarter. We hope he recovers before Madras’s next match tomorrow morning.",
      "The third water polo match followed suit of the second one. It was end to end action as both teams scored regularly and there was nothing much to separate them. The scores were tied 4 all till the last quarter when Roorkee managed to pull away and finally win 6-4. Jose scored 4 times and Kunal and Maharnab scored a goal each for Roorkee. It must have been frustrating for Guwahati, to lose at the very end after a good showing throughout.",
      "",
      "The last match of the day was between Kanpur and Delhi. Kanpur butchered Delhi 18-2. The Delhites looked clueless even as they created chances but failed to get past the Kanpur goalkeeper, Arshil Abbas. In the fourth quarter, Delhi’s Abhishek committed a foul and was sent off permanently; but the game was all but over by then. Raghav emerged as the star player with a preposterous number of 8 goals. Vihang and Vasu also scored 5 goals apiece for Kanpur.",
      "With this loss, Delhi crashes out of the Water Polo event and the picture of Pool A becomes clear. Kanpur and Kharagpur both make it into the semifinals.",
      "The matches for the coming days promise unbridled excitement and lots of fun. Best of luck to all the teams for the rest of the meet.",
      "Correction: Nikhil Mohan was a participant in the 200 meter men’s breaststroke and not backstroke. Also, Nikhil Mohan and not Kunal scored for Rorkee in the water polo match between Rorkee and Guwahati.",

      "Trishla Singh, an alumnus of IIT Kanpur, is a champion swimmer having a record of 4 gold medals each in three consecutive Inter IIT meets (2004-2006). She had a proficient academic career in psychology spanning over a decade and currently works at Accenture. Vox Populi got an opportunity to interact with her during her visit to IIT Kanpur as the Guest of Honour for the 32nd Inter IIT Aquatics Meet.",
      "",
      "Vox:Vox Populi would like to welcome you on behalf of the campus community to the 32nd Inter IIT Aquatics Meet!",
      "First off, how does it feel coming back to the campus and being a part of yet another Inter IIT Aquatics meet – this time leading not only IIT Kanpur – but all the participating contingents as the Guest of Honour?",
      "Ms. Trishla:I feel really good to be back almost after a decade, because the campus still seems very familiar – I see familiar faculty, familiar faces, all of which bring back many cherished memories. At the same time, the campus has changed a lot, especially in terms of the sports facilities and opportunities here – they are truly remarkable, and far better than what any of the IITs had in my time. As for Aquatics Meet, it feels great to finally be able to watch the events without the stress of having to do a 100-metre event and win a medal in it (laughs).",
      "Vox:When you reminisce about your days in the campus, who are the people you remember as being an integral part of your sports innings? Could you share some of your memories associated with them?",
      "Ms. Trishla:One of the people whom I’ll never forget is Mr Vadi, our swimming coach. He was a person who used to follow a very strict discipline. One of the memories I have with him is that, he used to send back the students who came even five minutes late to the pool without allowing them to swim! This was the first time I saw such a strict discipline being followed as this hadn’t been the case with any other coach that I’ve trained with.",
      "I also have fond memories associated with Mr Venkateshan. He was a very familiar and encouraging face for me, and he was the one person whom you could find at each and every sport facility when you needed him. Also he was the person who led to the inclusion of girls’ swimming events in Inter IIT Aquatics Meet!",
      "And then there was Mishra sir who used to train us in basic athletics. All of them were very action oriented people: they weren’t the people who spoke to much, but if you are interested in a sport and require some help from their side, they would leave no stone unturned.",
      "Vox:We’ve come to know that your career in swimming began quite early, from 3 medals in the Junior National Championship in 1992 to 4 medals in the 2005 Inter-IIT aquatics meet. So where did it begin? Who introduced you to the sport and when?Ms. Trishla:Well, both my parents were in the hotel business, and my father being the General Manager, we would stay in the hotel he worked in. Hence, the hotel pool was a facility I always had access to, and that was where my sisters and I learned how to swim. My first coach was my mother. Later on, as our interest and skill developed, we were formally trained in the sport.",
      "Vox:Apart from your glamorous medal tally in aquatics, you have been a consistent performer in academics and were a part of the Counselling Service and Dramatics society as well. We would like to know how did you manage to devote time to so many things and do them with such level of proficiency?Ms. Trishla:This was primarily because I had never been to an institute that offered so many opportunities at one single place. What I had experienced in the colleges I had been, was that they had academics in the campus, but then you had to go to different facilities for your other interests like sports, theatre, dance etc. Since I could do lot of other things that I wanted to do her in the campus, those were the best times of my life. Moreover, if you really want to do something, you’ll surely find time to get on with it.",
      "Vox:We’ve also read that you’ve studied psychology since your Bachelor’s degree, with an emphasis on cognitive sciences. Did your acquaintance with this field help you with your sports career, where the mind has as a great a role to play as the body?Ms. Trishla:Well, one thing that did help was a  trick we learnt while studying competitive psychology. We were taught to visualize an event before it actually happened, so as to mentally prepare ourselves for what was to come. Once we were mentally prepared, our bodies prepared themselves automatically.",
      "Vox:And what about the converse? What lessons have sports taught you, that have proven relevant even in your corporate career?Ms. Trishla:Well, I believe that a great takeaway from sports for me has been that it taught me to work hard and consistently, so as to eventually achieve your goal in small steps. I am not the kind of person to study all night before an examination, simply because I would never do something similar in sports. Leaving something for the last minute simply drives me crazy; I prefer to approach all my tasks systematically, and enjoy the little steps that lead me to my goal.",
      "Vox:We have an interesting excerpt from your personal life : After the sad demise of your father, you were made the head of the family – or given the ‘pagdi’, this was also the first case in the state of Rajasthan where women organised the ‘pagdi’ ceremony. This was something very ahead of times and an example of very progressive outlook. What kind of upbringing by your parents instilled such strong values in you? What should be the major takeaway for the young readers from this incident of your life?Ms. Trishla:I had two younger sisters but no brothers. It was due to this fact that we never knew how girls were treated differently from boys in a family. We always did what we wanted to, whether it was sports academics or anything else, as long as it was logical and ethically correct. So this was how it went by our family values, there were no other filters applied on whatever we wanted to do. My father used to encourage us in sports and he never pressurized us to get into academics and phrases like ‘girls should do this’ and ‘girls should not do this’ were never a part of our upbringing.",
      "So when it came to the situation of performing his last rites, the most logical thing was – that since it was something very personal, someone from the family had to do it. Because I was the eldest, I performed the last rites, only to realise later that women are not supposed to perform them. Also a major influence to such outlook was that I was brought up in Goa where there is no apparent gender discrimination in terms of marking things which boys are supposed to do and what girls are.",
      "A major takeaway from this should be that at one point, a person needs to question things in the society. Why are we studying so much ? What’s the use of tickling our brains that much if we are going to blindly follow the customs that have been told to us.",
      "Vox:It has been over a decade since you started your corporate innings – are you still able to devote time to the sports, especially swimming, considering the busy professional life that you lead?Ms. Trishla:Well, I haven’t been able to continue with swimming as much as I’d like, because of the difficulty in obtaining swimming slots in the city. Yet I still do take out time for sports – I’m currently training to run half-marathons, and run at least three days a week. I’m also fortunate to be situated near Pondicherry, where I regularly go surfing. I would also like to compete in a half ironman run ( a triathlon event ) in the next year.",
      "Infact sports are always going to be an integral part of my life, I can’t imagine myself devoting all my time to academics or my corporate career. And sports is something you get addicted to, it is such a mood elevator, it relaxes you and makes you feel so good about yourself.",
      "Vox:Finally, what would be your message to the contingent from IIT Kanpur  who are going to contest for the title from their home arena this time ?Ms. Trishla:All I would like to say is – “Guys, just go for it ! . You have been prepared well and I have heard from your coaches that there have been summer camps and training sessions, further you have so many experienced people who have maintained a fantastic winning streak all these years.  So it is all out there, just put your best foot forward and grab it. Wish you all the very best for the meet.”",

      "With the inter IIT aquatics meet kicking off on Saturday, the question on everybody’s mind is “Will the IIT Kanpur contingent be able to repeat historyby winning the aquatics meet,as it did back in 2009, when it last hosted it”",
      "The first part of the 51st inter IIT sports meet starts tomorrow with the opening ceremony of the aquatics meet. The 32nd aquatics meet marks the start of the campaign of the eleven participating IITs to lift the General Championship trophy. 135 participants from the 11 participating IITs will compete in events of swimming and water polo in the aquatics meet. After a span of 7 years, the inter IIT meet is again being hosted by IIT Kanpur. The IIT Kanpur contingent would want to continue its legacy by lifting the GC trophy for the third consecutive time, this time on its home ground.",
      "The opening ceremony is scheduled to start tomorrow at 3:30 pm at the swimming pool. The chief guest of the aquatics meet are Padma Shri awardee, Ms. Bula Chowdhury. She is a national swimming champion and thefirst woman to have swum across sea channels off five continents. She has represented India in the world championship and the Asian games.She has also been felicitated with the Arjuna award and the Tenzing Norgay Lifetime Achievement award.",
      "Other guests of honour are Mr. NK Pandey, Dr. Kripal Singh, and Miss Trishla Singh. Mr.NK Pandey was one of the first physical education officers of IIT Kanpur who led the establishment of the swimming pool here. Dr. Kripal Singh was one of the sports officers of IIT-Kanpur. Ms. Trishla Singh, an alumnus of IIT Kanpur, is a national level diver and was adjudged the best swimmer in two Inter IIT Aquatics meets.",
      "The opening ceremony will be addressed by Dr. Indranil Manna, the patron, Dr. A.R. Harish, the chairman and Dr. NR Patra, the convenor of the organizing committee. The organizing team of inter IIT has also planned a professional diving show to be conducted during the opening ceremony during which renowned divers of India will showcase their dazzling skills.",
      "The events will be conducted in two slots everyday, from 2ndto 5thOctober. The morning slot will start at 7:30 am and the evening slot at 3pm. Heats will be conducted in the morning slot and the final for those events will be conducted in the evening slot of the same day.",
      "In water polo, IIT Kanpur is placed in group A along with IIT Kharagpur and IIT Delhi. The top 2 amongst these three will qualify for the semifinals. IIT Kanpur faces a tough challenge to top the group stage as it is placed in the same pool along with last year’s champions IIT KGP.",
      "The matched to look out for are summarised in the table. The pool matches of IIT Kanpur against IIT Delhi and Kharagpur are likely to be spectacles to watch.",
      "The organizing team of inter IIT released the official mascot – the Kanpuriya kid ‘Bauaa’ earlier this week. Our innocent, enthusiastic and cheerful ‘Bauaa’, who is a Panda, will be there to cheer, motivate and boost the spirits of participants across all contingents.",
      "The Directors’ dinner, also known as gala dinner, will be held in the evening on the 4th of October. This is the time when the participants will finally be able to relax and celebrate after the months of hard work they had put in for the aquatics meet. It will be held in the newly constructed Hall of Residence 12. This dinner will be attended by the participants, Sports and Physical Education Committee (SPEC) members, officials, other guests and the members of the organising committee.",
      "The award ceremony will be held on the final evening. Individual winners and the best overall  swimmers will be felicitated. The host of the 52nd inter IIT sports meet will also be announced during the ceremony.",

      "Nikhil Upadhye, a Y8 batch alumnus of IIT Kanpur shares the experience of his journey from a civil engineering undergrad to being the co-founder and CEO of Aarav Unmanned Systems (AUS). Aarav Unmanned Systems is a techno startup from IIT Kanpur which primarily focuses on commercial application of drones. Following is the conversation of Vox Populi with Nikhil Upadhye which could not have happened at a better place: Airstrip IITK!",
      "Who are the people working at AUS?",
      "We are a bunch of engineers, developers and designers who develop high-end autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. We primarily focus on the commercial applications of drones. There were four of us who started AUS and currently our team is composed of sixteen people, all possessing a technical background.",
      "",
      "When did you start and how did you come together?",
      "We founded AUS in September 2013. Well (chuckles), the second part is a long story. I’ll try to cut it short. Suhas (Banshiwala, member of robotics club at IITK) and I were roommates. I was a member of aeromodelling club and used to do some work in the flight laboratory. There, I met Vipul (Singh) who completed his graduation from Amity University and was working here as a research assistant. Yeshwanth (Reddy) was Vipul’s friend. He did his post graduation in aerospace engineering from IITB.",
      "What would be the reason you will validate for forming this startup?",
      "We are passionate about cutting edge technology. It was one of the emerging fields at that point of time. I, being a member of aeromodelling club, had worked in this field. I represented IITK in the SAE aero design competition as well, when it was our first time in the international event. I knew we had the capacity & potential to make these things indigenously. Plus I felt this is an area in which India is lagging behind and there is scope to grow.",
      "What were the problems you faced initially?",
      "Well primarily there were security concerns. India has never seen commercial applications of drones in the past. The bureaucracy is quite slow out here. But we were able to convince them by assuring that we’ll take permission from the police whenever we fly over a particular area. I feel every new technology has to face such kind of hurdles.",
      "Wasn’t there any family pressure for taking up a job?",
      "Not exactly. Yes, they were abit apprehensive initially but they agreed by looking at my interest in aeromodelling. Since then, they have always been very supportive. Actually when I look at my batch mates, I realize that they might have got entries in their balance sheet but unfortunately they haven’t learnt anything new since they left the institute. That’s what I told my parents that, in case I fail I can always come back and take up a job. The change would only be of a couple of lacks of rupees which won’t make a huge difference in life.",
      "What are the applications of your product?",
      "Unmanned aerial vehicles have been used in defence. We look forward for their commercial applications. We provide applications like GIS surveying, 3D mapping, precision agriculture, industrial inspection and surveillance.",
      "Every construction company has to do a survey of their plot. It is a critical part during planning. Our product will be replacing the conventional methods. Formerly surveying used to take 8-10 days. Now using our UAV’s it takes 30 minutes of flight and around four hours of image processing. Even the accuracy is quite promising.",
      "Apart from that we have also targeted precision agriculture. For that we just had to change the camera to multispectral camera. We collect the soil and crop health data and determine whether the crop is getting enough pesticide and water. This has helped the farmers to improve the productivity by 20-30%.",
      "",
      "How helpful was IITK?",
      "IITK has been very helpful. The major advantage was having an airstrip here itself. There are great manufacturing facilities, namely the 4i labs. We crashed hundreds of drones while testing. Ours is a hardware technology startup so funding is a big issue. We got a 25 lakh SIIC loan and used to work in the SIDBI Innovation and Incubation Centre, IIT Kanpur.",
      "How do you carry out your manufacturing?",
      "Our own team carries out the production. We have a good knowledge of composites. We do not place order to factories as they demand a number of pieces. This has given us a lot of flexibility.",
      "What are your future plans?",
      "We have a vision of unlimited expansion. We’ll be focussing on commercial applications only. Drone delivery would be our next target.",
      "Any word of advice for IITK entrepreneurs?",
      "I have seen a misconception amongst students that building a B-Plan on paper will build a startup. One needs to have hands on experience in that field to be a successful entrepreneur. Downloading a B-Plan template and searching for investors is not the correct way. IITs are places where people have potential to build in core technology and innovations can emerge. Unfortunately students are less interested in the technical part and more in the swag associated with it.",
      "Last question, how have you changed as an individual since you founded AUS?",
      "That’s a tricky question. I have changed a lot. The perspective of looking at things has changed. I have become more tolerant. Before forming AUS I had hardly faced any failure. Now there are plenty of them everywhere, be it registering a company or making something new. Life is not that easy, it was much easy earlier.",

On the occasion of Teachers’ Day, the Gopal Das Bhandari Memorial and the Distinguished Faculty Awards will be conferred upon the faculty members. In addition to these awards, the institute will convey its gratitude to professors who have dedicated twenty five years of their lives to teaching on campus.",
      "The Gopal Das Bhandari Memorial Outstanding Teacher Award was instituted by Mr. Anil Bhandari to honour his father. Mr. Bhandari was a student of the Mechanical Engineering department of the 1969 batch. In addition to a citation, the award includes a cash award of Rs. 50,000.",
      "Till last year, the graduating batch of undergraduate students voted for this award but the new SSPC manual mandates that the Students’ Senate nominate the faculty member for it. By the time the new manual was approved, the first round of voting had already been conducted. In light of this, an ad-hoc committee consisting of one graduating student from each department was constituted which completed this task. The Students’ Senate will soon prepare a proposal for the procedure to be followed in the future.",
      "This year, the award will be bestowed upon Prof. Sumit Ganguly of the Computer Science and Engineering department. He completed his B.Tech from IIT Kanpur in 1987 and went on to do M.S. and PhD from the University of Texas, Austin. His interests lie in the fields of databases and data stream processing. He has taught courses like Data Streaming : Algorithms and Systems and Principles of Data Systems, which have endeared him to students and no doubt inspired many to join his fields of interest.",
      "",
      "For the Distinguished Faculty Award, nominations are invited from the students, alumni and faculty. Each year a call for nominations is circulated and the name, along with the reason the said person is nominating the professor have to sent via mail or in a sealed envelope to the DOFA office. Then a committee consisting of the Director, DOFA, three other professors and the President, Students’ Gymkhana or his nominee selects two to four professors for the honour. This year, Prof. Prakash M. Dixit and Prof. Jitendra Kumar are the recipients of the award.",
      "Prof. Prakash M. Dixit of the Mechanical Engineering department completed his B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur in 1974 going on to finish his Ph.D. from University of Minnesota, Minneapolis in 1979. His interests are focused on Metal Forming,Large Deformation Elasto-Plastic Impact/Contact Problems, Ductile Fracture and Finite Element Method.",
      "",
      "Prof. Jitendra Kumar is part of the Materials Science Program and his fascination is with Nano electronic and magnetic recording, hydrogen energy storage materials and electron microscopy. Having taught courses like Characterisation of Materials and Structural and Magnetic Properties of Materials, he has left a profound impact on many students.",
      "",
      "The following professors are being felicitated for their service exceeding twenty five years.",
      "",
      "Our institute is truly privileged to have professors who are embodiments of the concept of ‘guru’ and it is because of them that IIT Kanpur has achieved the stature it holds today. Vox Populi thanks them for their tireless service to IIT Kanpur and wishes that they continue to carry the torch of education and knowledge for many more years to come.",
      "Correction : The name of Professor Sumit Ganguly had been nominated by the Students’ Senate for The Gopal Das Bhandari Memorial Award but since the Academic Senate had not considered this agenda, it couldn’t be awarded on the occasion of Teachers’ Day.",

      "Akshat Singhal, a Y9 batch alumnus of IIT Kanpur who was directly involved with theLaser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)experiment and co-authored the phenomenal paper “Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger, Feb 11, 2016” was on campus recently. He shares with Vox, his experiences as a student in IIT-Kanpur, and how those experiences helped him in the journey of life.",
      "My experiences in IIT Kanpur",
      "It all started during Takneek. Before college, I was quite interested in astronomy, in what NASA and ISRO did and I used to watch a lot of documentaries on Discovery. Those were the things that encouraged me. During Takneek, I met many like minded individuals. We pursued our passion and stood first in Astronomy quiz in Takneek and in Techkriti later. We saw astronomy club had a good potential. I was also participating in dance, and at times it was hard to balance dance, astronomy and academics. But somehow I was doing it. Next year we were chosen for secretaries. We had some ideas, we implemented them. Then the coordinator interviews were there and soon we realised that this is not the best the club can be.",
      "We realised we had to change it. But we didn’t know how or what to do. From our secretary times, we realised that the sky is not our good friend! We cannot rely on it. So we must have our own ‘sky’. We had a meeting with the then SnT general secretary, Pulkit Agarwal and we came up with a silly idea. It involved covering the entire outreach auditorium from inside with a black cloth with some system to show stars and then do observations there. Of course that was logistically and financially not possible. We would have had to close our club for a century to ensure that the club had enough funds to build the planetarium.",
      "After a lot of research, we ended up with few possible ideas, and we got the funding. Now the pressure was on us, to do justice to that trust. Otherwise we could not expect similar generosity in future. Our SnT general secretary was very interested in it. Our initial planetarium (covering entire auditorium with black cloth) proposal was absolutely impractical but he encouraged us. Had he been a rational or logical guy he would have laughed at us. Instead, he appreciated our efforts and because of his encouragement we pursued our dream. By that time, Abhinav Prateek was the general secretary. He fought for the funds and helped us at every step. He said “Whatever you do, if it’s good you take the credit, if it’s wrong, I take the blame. I am with you, don’t worry… You just focus on your dream.” Finally, we inaugurated it, the record books accepted our proposal and we were acknowledged as India’s first student made planetarium, in Limca Book of Records, and as Asia’s first student planetarium in Asia Book of Records.",
      "Interestingly, everything was done by the first and second year students. The ideas were from first yearites. There were engineering challenges which first yearites solved themselves. Just imagine, if the precision had been off by one degree, then the sphere could not have been formed. At the end of the day, we were able to finish it.",
      "After the success of planetarium, I started discussing other topics in astronomy and the mathematics involved in them with professors. Till now we used to only ‘count stars’, which was not very interesting. That was the time when we introduced the proposal of the observatory. This proposal had been pending for the past 12 years,  but it required more than Rs. 33 lakh (current cost Rs. 25 lakh) which the institute didn’t have for a student club or even for semi-professional projects. With help from DOSA sir, we got part of the budget. This time the challenge was more financial and logistical and it took us a year to overcome it.",
      "Once the instruments arrived, we didn’t know how to assemble it. Internet guidelines and manuals weren’t sufficient and we didn’t want to do something wrong because the instruments were very expensive and sensitive. Now the only thing left was to assemble and make sure everything worked, but there were many technical problems on the way. Somehow we solved both technical and logistic problems and we successfully assembled the observatory.",
      "In this journey, a lot of us appreciated the courses we were taught in IIT Kanpur and realised their importance. We were foolish not to have that foresight. Students often think, “What’s the use of Cauchy criterion?”, or “Why do we study MTH 10 at al1?”, all of which seems boring at that time. We actually had to use those concepts in real life.",
      "Life after IIT Kanpur",
      "Life after the four years on campus was somewhat hazy. I didn’t know what to do exactly. I was good with commissioning work, as I did a lot of it while leading the club and my hall in various events. But that did not mean I was good with research. Part of the reason being, I was not good in academics. But it was the professors here who saw my potential better than me, and motivated me to take up research in astronomy and recommended me to go to IUCAA, Pune (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics).",
      "",
      "So from there I started looking at this idea more seriously. I didn’t apply for placements and went to  Pune. There my contributions were in the field of gravitational waves and people appreciated my work. I was not good with physics or advanced mathematics but when time demanded, I did my research through internet or books, and completed the job.",
      "Then I applied for a PhD in Europe. Again, I fell into a state of confusion, whether to stay back in India or go to Europe. I was selected for the Marie Curie Fellowship, which is regarded as one of Europe’s most competitive and prestigious awards. I got a tremendously warm welcome there.",
      "And then came the life changing event. After 100 years of research, humans detected gravitational waves. The sensitivity we had to achieve for this accomplishment was beyond imagination. It’s like noticing the change in one drop in all the water on earth. I would say I was a small brick in a huge castle. But passion and hardwork drove me to reach the right place at the right time.",
      "Message to students",
      "I faced challenges everywhere, in IIT Kanpur during hall events, during my club activities, in IUCAA during gravitational waves research. What IIT Kanpur has taught me is that if there is a challenge and you don’t know how to overcome it, you can’t give excuses or say “I don’t know” or “I can’t do it”. Just put your best efforts and you will make it.  And this small lesson that I learnt in IIT Kanpur helped me throughout my life. The series of challenges I faced here gave me that boost to grow my interest and convert my hobby into my profession.",

      "The Commercial Establishment Monitoring and Management Committee (CEMMC) thus requested CCD to extend its seating capacity and to lay their terms for further extension of their permit. The outfit accepted the request & started renovation work on 13thAugust, setting a tentative deadline of 20-25 days.",
      "There have been many visible changes in the design, aesthetics and interiors. The production counter has been shifted to the left and enlarged visibly, reducing the congestion in front of the entrance. There are now two counters for placing orders which shall hopefully increase the speed and efficiency of services. The interiors have been renovated thoroughly with appealing posters and illustrations on the walls and glass windows.",
      "",
      "",
      "These renovations required an investment of approximately 30 lakh rupees from the outfit. In the recent past, the outlet had also enlarged its menu upon the request of the CEMMC, adding four new drinks and some new burgers to its spread. Having observed the good track record of the outlet so far, the CEMMC decided to extend its permit by 5 years (ending March 2022).",
      "In the future, the Institute Works Department (IWD) plans to lay a cobbled path beside the outlet for improved seating arrangements. On its part, CCD plans to cover & air-cool the area to make it one of the most awesome places in campus to hang out. The IWD shall also facilitate partitioning of the Southern Labs (SL) canteen that will help in extending CCD’s storage space.",

      "“The campus saw an unfortunate demise of Mr. Alok Pandey, a 33 year old PhD student in the department of Material Science yesterday afternoon. Mr. Pandey reported to HC with a neck and chest* pain around 2:15 pm. He was administered an injection for relieving pain followed by an ECG which indicated a severe case of heart attack. He was referred to the Cardiology Institute in the city and was declared brought dead there.",
      "Since then, the campus has erupted into many protests and marches as it has been alleged that the demise was partly due to negligence at the end of Health Centre.”- Vox Populi report dated 10th August.",
      "While many of us may not have known Alok, his sudden death struck the deepest of chords in our hearts. He instantly turned into a dear friend, whose bright face we could almost visualise in our heads. Not just his peers pursuing their PhDs, but even undergraduate students, professors and staff members found a face to stand for their own unpleasant experiences at the Health Centre (HC). “It could have been any one of us” – was the fear that echoed in their passionate demands to heal what some of the protestors termed as the “Death Centre”.",
      "For fifty-three hours, protesters braved the blazing sun, merciless rain and sleepless nights to eke out words from the seemingly passive administration. Rarely has the campus seen such a huge non-incentivized crowd come together spontaneously. A collective conscience which resonated with someone else’s pain and the protesters’ own deeper insecurities propelled the struggle.",
      "",
      "Tragedies, it is said, bring out both the best and worst in us. The mob encircled the Director and some other professors at the SAC chauraha for an entire night interspersed with rain. Disruption became the norm as the power was cut down and roads were blocked. Some students complained of facing derision from a section of protesters for not participating wholeheartedly. In the meeting with IAC (Institute Advisory Committee)  in Lecture Hall 20, the administration was faced with the resentment of over a thousand attendees. Ugliness only mounted as some students  shouted out unfeeling remarks to the authorities when they did not get answers to their questions. Perhaps, promptness at the end of the administration could have prevented the escalation of the protest to such an extent.",
      "However, in the IAC meeting that followed, the four demands raised by the students were finally accepted. The first three pertained to the immediate concern of delivering justice to Alok, while the fourth one called for a comprehensive investigation of the functioning of the HC.",
      "",
      "Alok’s demise and the ensuing protest pushed us out of our cocooned lives. Though the protesters dispersed contentedly once their demands were accepted, we mustn’t let the flame in our hearts diffuse, for the larger goal is still to be attained. While the protests saw a thumping participation from students, only a few of them chose to attend the following General Body Meeting (GBM) and Students’ Senate meeting which were called to discuss HC reforms. Students have to be stakeholders in this exercise as much as the authorities and Vox urges them to take up a proactive role in coming up with innovative solutions to the issues that surround us. We mustn’t retract to our complacent lives and should  make use of the various platforms offered by the institute for us to drive changes in the system.",
      "Once goodwill, empathy and transparency are fostered amongst the members of our community, we wouldn’t have to see blame games on sensitive issues, authorities hushing things up or ugly face-offs between students and administrators. Instead, we’d build a democratic community with open minded individuals, actively and rationally debating the affairs of concern and assuming responsibility for their actions.",
      "Let Alok’s tragic demise not go in vain. Let this historic movement stir our retrieval from the quagmire of complacency.",
      "*as reported in the director’s communique. It was claimed by some that Alok reported pain in his neck and shoulder.",

      "One of the most important and potentially life-changing decisions that can be taken by a student here at IIT Kanpur is that of changing one’s branch. However, there have been some cases in the recent past where, due to human error, students have been allotted branches they do not want to be in, which could have been easily avoided.",
      "Over the past few years there have been few such cases, once in Y12 batch where the student wanted a branch change in Chemical Engineering (CHE) but got Civil Engineering (CE) instead, and a recent one in Y15 batch, who wanted to apply for Chemical Engineering (CHE) but got B.S. Chemistry (CHM).The nature of error has been pretty common. All of them have mentioned wrong branch codes and hence have been allotted branches they did not expect. The source of error being, the ambiguous branch change application forms.",
      "",
      "",
      "Although, branch codes for B.Tech. and B.S. streams are separately mentioned, individual branch codes are neither expanded nor there is some kind of a legend or key to abbreviation. Evidently, there will clearly be some confusion among similar codes such as CSE, CHE, CHM, CE. Though one should be careful while filling a form of such importance, a tiny error can be devastating to the student concerned. A few simple solutions can potentially rule out any scope of human error:",

      "We discussed this issue with the DoAA officials. They have taken note of this problem. We hope that some change will be incorporated in the branch change forms rolled out next year, so that such unfortunate events can be averted in future.",

      "The Academic Senate recently decided that all instructors will be required to show the answer scripts of the Mid Semester examinations within 14 days of the end of the exams. Vox contacted Prof. Neeraj Mishra, Dean of Academic Affairs, for further details on the matter.",
      "We were informed that the proposal was put forward by the SUGC (Senate Under-Graduate Committee) since there had been multiple cases in the past where students had requested the SUGC and the DoAA office for extension of the deadline for dropping a course. As per the current rules, a student enrolled in a given course can drop it only before a stipulated date in the semester which is generally few weeks after the mid semester examinations. Since there is no time limit for showing answer scripts to the students for the Mid Semester examinations, sometimes students are unable to judge their performance and hence cannot decide whether to drop the course or not.",
      "In light of the aforementioned circumstance, the proposal was put forward in the Academic Senate by the SUGC. The Senate decided to pass this proposal and the minutes for the same will be confirmed in the next meeting, planned to be held on 21st May, 2016. The policy may be enacted from the Summer Term of 2016. In case it is not possible to do so, it will be in force from the Fall Semester 2016-17.",
      "The proposal also includes a provision to include the deadline for showing of result of Mid Semester examinations to the Academic Calendar like that of End Semester, as is the current policy. In case an Instructor decides to hold two Mid Semester exams for the course, the proposal will be applicable to the one included in the Academic Calendar.",

      "Context:Owing to the fund cuts by the MHRD to IITs, it was decided that starting this semester students would be required to pay their electricity bills each month. The bills for the month of January are already out and the numbers are, so to say, extravagant.",
      "Prior to this per-month-per-student billing, students used to pay a consolidated amount of  about 1450 rupees per semester for the electricity usage. The semester fee for this semester was reduced by 2000 odd rupees (which included the amount for electricity consumption and payment for pensions of mess workers of the erstwhile government messes) and it was estimated that with the per month billing in place, student might end up paying a 1000 rupees or so extra for each semester.",
      "But surprisingly, students of some halls received bills as high as 1400 just for the month of January. The use of tubelights, a fan and a socket resulting in a bill of 1400 is rather far-fetched and this caused a lot of furore among the student community. Students took to social media platforms to vent out their frustrations and in the 3rd CoSHA meeting held on 22nd February, this was taken up as an agenda item. In the CoSHA meeting, the house formed a committee comprising 3 PG and 2 UG students to look closely into the matter, suggest a better model and give recommendations to the authorities.",

      "The model prepared for billing the students had sizable flaws and consequently drew flak from the student community. But owing to the proactive participation of general body members, the President Students’ Gymkhana (both incoming and outgoing) and certain CoSHA members towards resolving this issue, the students have been saved from the humongous bills.",

In case you do not recognize certain birds, make note of their features such as size, colour of plumage, and call. The bird guide on the GBBC website would help you identify the species on the basis of your observations. Moreover, if you are a photography enthusiast, you could take part in the Photo Contest and possibly win exciting prizes.",

      "On 7th November, Vox Populi conducted Campus Dialogue II: The Gymkhana Open House Session. Hosted by Karan Deep Sharma, from Vox Populi, the event was an eye-opener for those who attended, giving a clear glimpse into the Gymkhana’s functioning. Starting off with a short presentation, the General Secretaries detailed up on the crucial decisions taken by each council in their tenure. The host of the evening Karan posed questions based on feedback received from the online survey forms. Most importantly, the campus junta present had some very real issues, for which they sought direct clarifications from the executives.",
      "",
      "The first presentation was by the SnT council general secretary Chirag Jha. Institute teams, in specific Pushpak, are currently in the process of being recognized as a part of the council. A committee has also been formed for the expansion of the Tinkering Lab to include advanced technologies like rapid prototyping. Steps like these are being taken to facilitate advanced projects being undertaken currently by the council.",
      "",
      "It was pointed out that there is a perception of SnT clubs not contributing towards solving technological problems on campus. Chirag countered this by mentioning a mess system developed by students of electronics club. He, however, agreed that there are very few projects of this type as there are committees that exist at the institute for solving such problems and thus students lose interest.",
      "There were several complaints related to SnT Clubs not returning caution money. In specific, the Aeromodelling Club was mentioned in reference to Summer‘14. As a solution, a system is being implemented where clubs will issue a receipt for all cash exchanged, including caution money. The duration the money will be kept and the conditions under which it can be seized by the club will be clearly mentioned on the receipt.",
      "A first-year student in the survey form had commented on the fact that SnT clubs provide few opportunities to freshers after Takneek. Chirag admitted that this year, due to a lack of projects, opportunities of advanced projects where seniors would guide first years were very few. He urged Y15 to be patient with clubs, as new projects and opportunities would eventually crop up.",
      "Next up was the Games and Sports Council. For all those who did not get a CPA of their choice, inter-sports CPA change will be officially allowed provided the respective coaches consent. NCC people will not be eligible for this as it is a yearlong course which is not supposed to be broken in between.",
      "One of the pertinent issues raised was that the council seems to focus entirely on Inter-IIT and not on uplifting the sporting culture in the campus, there are few opportunities for those who are interested in exploring a new sport. M.Suryaprakash said that he believed that there was a need for professional coaching in club activities to ensure that they were effective. Additionally, lack of publicity results in very few freshers joining the clubs under Games and Sports Council.",
      "",
      "The President, Students’ Gymkhana, Gautam Pratap Singh highlighted some crucial decisions taken by the Presidential Council. New bodies called cells have been added to the appendix of the constitution. The cells will be a notch above the Clubs in terms that they have more diverse nature of work and would be directly answerable to students’ senate. Additionally, he informed that the Presidential Council would be dissolved and 3 new separate cells, Community Welfare Cell, E-Cell and Academics & Research Cell would be formed which came into effect on 31st December, 2015.",
      "",
      "",
      "It was pointed out that a perception has been making rounds about an increase in interference of institute authorities in student affairs. Gautam stated that people perceived this because they had only seen two deans of student affairs. People saw a kind of liberalisation coming with the former DOSA. Now they see a different kind of system being implemented. The Executives are of the view that because of this, students are becoming more accountable in the way they interact with institute bodies. Shubham Atreja emphasised that there is a significant difference between interference and involvement. In this case, increased involvement would be a more appropriate way to describe the situation.",
      "",
      "The Students’ Senate report was presented by the Chairperson Shubham Atreja. The Senate is to have a red book, in which proceedings will be officially recorded. General Secretary, Cultural Council will be changed to General Secretary, Cultural Affairs, and he will overlook all cultural activities on campus and not just be restricted to the council, similarly for other councils.",
      "",
      "One of the most visible issues was a rift and lack of understanding between the Senators and the Executives. The President clearly stated that senators do not put effort into reading the proposals that are sent to them. In fact, many do not even attend meetings regularly, which should definitely be a cause of concern among the residents of the campus who voted for them. The Senators on the other hand, had a general feeling that their opinions were not given much weight in the Senate.",
      "Next up was the Cultural Council, General Secretary, Ashish Aggrawal. The basic problem mentioned by the general body with cultural clubs is that they take up a lot of time and many people do not join just for the fear of ruining their academics. Ashish was of the opinion that to perform well in events, these clubs must put in good practice. However, for other people, attending workshops is still an open option.",
      "Questions were raised regarding the relatively high budgets allocated to dance and dramatics clubs. Ashish,stated that these clubs needed funds for maintaining and buying equipment. Additionally, the budget has already been reduced compared to previous years.",
      "",
      "The Films and Media Council, General Secretary, Prateek Mishra highlighted a few crucial points.Firstly, he highlighted the fact that Photography Club should not be perceived as just a coverage body. Secondly, he felt that coordinators did most of the work in clubs and other people need to be more active. The general body inquired about the role of FMC in increasing publicity of IIT Kanpur. He mentioned that the campus video and articles published by Vox Populi were a step in this direction.",
      "",
      "A democracy is only as good as those who have formed it. It functions well only when the stakeholders are aware of the developments and functioning of their representatives. The Open House Session is a very visible platform for both raising issues and developing this awareness.",
      "We at Vox Populi actively invite both the campus junta and senators to participate with even more enthusiasm in future sessions of this kind.",

      "The following is anopinion pieceby a freshman on the institute advisory for students against bringing laptops in their first year.",
      "",
      "A general chitchat with some of my non IITK friends with whom I shared a rule brought nuances of laughter to the conversation.  I’m talking about a quite peculiar advisory issued by IIT Kanpur more than a decade ago –  first year students are strongly discouraged to bring a laptop (or the ban of laptops; depends on how you perceive it). Though this informal discussion with my friends was not a very significant one but it portrayed an image of the institute contrary to the freedom that IIT-K is famed to provide. My four month stay on campus prompts me to talk of this anachronism of a rule.",
      "IITs boast of the great technology advancements and even propose an online JEE  advance exam while such a restriction is imposed, this puts me in a dilemma and forces me to have a look at the possible reasons that led to the formulation of this rule. The concerns of the administrative faculty like immaturity, possibility of watching TV series, decreasing social interaction and most important ‘low CPI’ seems relevant but isn’t the step a bit over the line? After all each one of us has cleared jee and is sensible enough to judiciously use his time.",
      "But is the rule able to achieve the objectives which seem to be the basis of its origin is again a matter of debate. Now more than ten years down the line everyone has a smart phone in his/her pocket, which along with the on campus internet facility can cause same or maybe greater level of distraction. Every small thing like checking the webmail is being done on the mobile phone. Moreover it brings along a new problem: ‘health issue’. Focusing your eye on a 5 inch screen rather than a 15 inch screen is any day going to cause a more adverse effect on your eyes, a big problem currently faced by the youth of the country.",
      "Also what if a student wishes to learn something beyond the normal curriculum, say curiosity to explore his branch, this rules at times is a hindrance in doing so. Though I don’t disagree that one can always overcome it by his determination but I and maybe many had faced problem of not having a personal laptop while practicing for hackathons. At the same time, I appreciate that our institute is not so rigid and allows first year students to bring laptop for projects like ‘Robocon’,’ AUV’ and many others.",
      "With due respect to the concerned authorities, I believe that with the passage of time, change is inevitable.  We need to introspect if we are doing something which others are not. I guess there exists scope for some amendments.",
      "As per that chitchat is concerned I may forget it when I come in my second year and get my laptop along  but the question is will the things ever change. Will the laptop ban ever wither away?",

      "It has been more than two months since we arrived here at IITK. But somehow, the last few weeks (takneek and midsems) seem to have been the longest. Opinions forged before coming to IITK (Ha!) have already given way to new ones.  In the “Disneyland of everything under the Sun”, life is pretty fast and opinions change. So this is a ‘Fresher’s Perspective’ as of September 30.",
      "My pseudo family (my bhais, baapu (and amma?), chachas, dada) is forever by my side. I take a step wrong and my baapu is there to guide me! But apart from the ‘student guide’ part , this family provides me with something more. A group of friends I can waste my time with! The orientation days were filled with the dread of ‘interaction’ with the seniors. But in hindsight I remember them as the days when I had the most fun. My baapu had preached the same since the very beginning!",
      "My father taught me to speak respectfully. My baapu teaches me ‘ IITK Lingo’. On the very first day I find myself listening to fun stuff like “chill hai”, “lass mat!”, “bahut bakaiti hai?”, “huggne ja raha hai?” and progressing on to unmentionable things! Smart and intelligent kids. The bright future of our nation. The ones who will represent us, speaking such a language? It was pretty hard to digest as it was nothing like I had previously imagined.  Once again, opinions change and I find myself at peace with hearing ‘pleasantries’ being shouted from all directions.",
      "Even in front of the professor?- you might ask. Well yes and no. They are disguised as anthems of the hall in which you belong!  That being said the hostels are little works of art in themselves! We were really underwhelmed by the rooms at first. However, with time you realize that it is the perfect scenario. The ‘green’ campus forces the bugs in, which in turn force you out. And here, rooms are just for sleeping. Also, the somewhat unsettling lack of LAN connection and code against laptops makes sure you are bonding with your wingies. (Please give me back my movies!)",
      "",
      "Then each resident is meticulously programmed to hate and despise every other hall. We have a President and his Cabinet i.e the HEC. Its main function is to look after the everyday functioning of the hall (20%) and generating ‘enthu’  in the freshers (80%) towards their hall.",
      "Don’t get me started on ‘enthu’. It is the only pre-requisite to fly. Yeah, so everyone must drink Red Bulls to get ‘enthu’ and subsequently generate wings. Had I known beforehand (like during my birth) I would have taken the precaution of falling into a cauldron full of Red Bull like Obelix did. All the clubs rely on it. There are 4 major sections. Cultural, Games and Sports, Science and Technology and Films and Media Council. Each of these in turn has another host of options in them. I wanted to join one from each! I fall repeatedly short on the requisite enthu to achieve this feat!  And,get this, there is still an option to open your very own Hobby Group. Personally, it would take me a long time finding one which hasn’t already been made!",
      "Now each of these major section holds its own annual completion: Hall level and College level. How wonderful! Having experienced Takneek in its full might, I am a little (nay, a lot) buzzed off about the Calender. Almost every weekend has some or the other competition going on! That being said, I cannot deny that it was Takneek that finally made me realize I was in college. And a wonderful one at that.We make stuff in our first year which third years of other colleges research on! The night-outs working on the projects and then the cheering are just some of the great moments.",
      "Then, of course, a special mention to Antaragni. The fest has hypnotized us from the day we heard of it. Ritambhara, a fashion show. Cause, why not?  4 days of madness. Even classes are cancelled! I still haven’t experienced this bliss. Come on 50thAntaragni, quicker!",
      "",
      "I would have been immensely happy at the number of competitions and clubs if not for studies. Then I remember studies are the reason I am here in the first place! This divine knowledge dawns when the midsems loom ahead. And then the library is the refuge. Three storied, fully air conditioned and during exams the 24hr schedule supports the erratic sleep plans I make. The amount of syllabus is vast. Time is minimal. But I feel no stress! That is the strength your friends give you when they say “kuch nahi pada!”",
      "And the subjects themselves are funny. MTH101 mocks your ideas on the obvious. HSS? Eh? What is that?  With such vast changes, including the return of subjective papers, you are highly likely to crash and burn along with your CPI. What doesn’t help is the “bulla kaatna” we do. Honestly, I can’t help it. If a room in the wing is open and there are people talking about stuff, I have to join them. Now I am stuck with mediocre grades. “End-Sem mein phod denge” Right. (yawn). That’s the spirit……",
      "The only course I am currently excelling is the Compulsory PE on the basis of attendance. It is still hard, though. Waking up at 5:30 AM just to run a given field twice. People say it should be scrapped. These are the ones with 3-4 bunks and staring down the barrel of ‘repeat’.",
      "How hard is it? Sleep at 3:00, wake at 5:30. Should be enough! And there will always be that one guy who would be like “maine to night out maara”. During the takneek week and the midsems, my capacity to stay awake was tested. (and it failed) With an average sleep of about 3 hrs for an entire fortnight, I still am not the Alpha in this. There are creatures (not people, creatures) who had 2 hrs. Yay, you won.",
      "Finally, Mess Food. My reactions in chronological order-",
      "The last one is open till 2:00 AM. Midnight snacking is a lot of fun. And suddenly, home feelstoo mundane. (Who’ll cook you up macaroni at 2 AM? Huh? Your mom? Ha!)",
      "As Jahangiri (the lesser known poet) said-“If there is heaven on earth, it probably isn’t here…” But all the same. It’s our college. And it’s IITK.",

      "Dr. Neeraj Misra, professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, was instated as theDean of Academic Affairslast semester. He has extensive research experience in fields of both Theoretical and Mathematical Statistics and has won national and international acclaim for his work. Prior to his tenure here, Dr. Misra has been affiliated to universities in Belgium and the USA.",
      "In conversation with Dr. Misra, Vox brings to you his views on academics in the country and plans for the institute.",
      "—————————————————————————————————————————————————————-",
      "Q: The state of and attitude towards technical education in India has faced criticism in recent years. What is your opinion on the same?",
      "A: I do not believe in attributing much importance to the attitudes and conditions because they are cyclic in nature. Today, the students in technical institutions are more oriented towards startups, which is an area having several role models for the youth. As a result, emphasis is laid on analytics rather than core engineering. Another widespread complaint is that people trained for engineering are opting for jobs in financial institutions. This trend has come up because of the visible difference in number of jobs offered by the respective sectors. Eventually, a period will come in this cycle, where core engineering will be of prime importance again.",
      "Q: Could you tell us your analysis of the new system of JEE?",
      "A: The number of good technical institutions in the country is less as compared to the number of talented students who aspire to join the same. Working in the framework of such constraints, I believe, that JEE is the best possible model. In fact, it is a very good process of elimination rather than selection.",
      "Q: A lot of efforts are being taken by students on Internet forums to increase IIT­K’s brand value and garner the attention of prospective students. Do you believe such measures are necessary?",
      "A: In my opinion, such measures are very necessary. I admit that the institute has not been very proactive in marketing. IIT­K takes academics very seriously, and no compromises are made in that area. Over and above classroom teaching, learning in general is encouraged via interaction and participation in varied activities. The student body plays a very proactive role in administrative affairs. Finally, the quality of life on campus is possibly the best in the country. A lot of preconceived notions exist about IIT­K which need to be dispelled. We should let go of complacency and highlight the plus points of the institute to bring focus back to it.",
      "Q: There have been certain instances of late where students have shown a disregard for academic ethics. How deep­rooted is this issue and how can it be addressed ?",
      "A: This situation is indeed worrying. As a short term solution, the Senate has instructed the SSAC to report to it every two months, instead of annually. This supervision by the Senate has helped deal with the cases effectively and hence, has caused a change in the outlook of the students on the issue. The shift of importance to marks over knowledge in our system could be one of the fundamental causes of this. To counter this shift in the long term, I believe that the system should cater to every type of student. The Academic Senate has made several provisions to help academically weak students. There should be a set of provisions for students who display high aptitude and interest in subjects too. They should be identified and should be encouraged by faculty, so as to promote knowledge. When this is done at the institute­level, people will start looking beyond marks, and this will serve as a deterrent to plagiarism.",
      "Q: A lot of flaws in theOARSwebsite have been discovered during registration. Is anything being done to correct this?",
      "A: OARS started as a student project and was intended for small­scale operations. As the number of students grew, upgrades were made when required, which were not very cohesive. This has resulted in the glitches in the system. Efforts are underway to improve this system, and in due time, we hope to have an entirely new system in place.",
      "Q: Concerns have been raised on the quantity of content in the courses, as a lot of concepts are rushed through towards the end of a course. This hampers proper comprehension and encourages mindless studying. How can this be changed?",
      "A: This problem has cropped up often. The lecture duration being cut down by five minutes has been a contributor to this issue. This small amount of time makes a big difference when the entire semester is considered. Also, at times absence from classes creates a gap between teaching and learning. I recognise that several students do well without attending class, but the presence of such students improves the general atmosphere of the lecture and encourages other students to learn. I would advise students to maintain attendance. Other than this, if at all a change in the course contents has to be made, it has to be done on a departmental level; the Institute, as a whole, cannot prescribe anything in this matter.",
      "Q: Could you enumerate your plan for the institute?",
      "A: As I mentioned above, I would really like to set up some system by which good students, who pursue knowledge, can be encouraged. I would also like to ensure that the ambitious programs like Minor, Double Major etc, set up by the institute achieve success. The current batch of outgoing students had a few who had completed these programs; I hope the number increases over the years. The best way to go about this would be to impose less restriction during course registration, especially during summer, so that students can enroll for the prescribed prerequisites. Lastly, I would like to work with students and contribute to the effort of building the IIT­K brand.",
      "Q: A word for the Freshers.",
      "A: You might have been at the top in your schools. Remember that you are now competing with the best and you should work harder. Do not give up halfway and resort to other avenues of passing time which might not be beneficial in the long run. In the first year, it is best to concentrate on core academics and understand the system. Once you do this successfully, the rest of your time at the institute will pass smoothly and you will be able to participate in all activities and events.",

      "“Bhaiya Opportunity School kahan par hai?”",
      "Even after spending more than 2 years on campus, we had to ask this question in our quest for information pertaining to the school. You can blame us for being ill-informed but the fault is not entirely ours. The school is indeed discreetly located as are the ambitions of the kids whom we generally overlook. All we knew was that it was beside the rear side entrance of ShopC. On seeking help, we were guided to the entrance gate, from where the path was no less than a maze.",
      "",
      "Children queueing up for morning assembly",
      "Opportunity School was set up in 1967 soon after Kendriya Vidyalaya and Campus School sprung up on the premises of IIT Kanpur. As both of them were meant exclusively for the children of IITK employees and administrative officials, there was a dire need of a school for children hailing from economically weaker backgrounds. Mr Santosh Kumar, a former student who has been teaching here for the past 15 years, recalls,”In earlier days we had to literally pick up children wandering on campus, but things have improved a lot now”.The students here are mostly children of migrant laborers, mess workers and domestic servants of areas in and around IITK. The school receives funding primarily from three sources: alumni, faculty and staff, and the Institute.",
      "The school started off with as few as 5-6 students, with a very meagre amount of fund. Day-to-day running of the school was a difficult task. It was during this time that a saviour in the form of Mr R S Shrivastava joined the school. A teacher, a principal, a guardian, even a cleaner, he donned all hats and donned them well. Mrs. Shalini pitches in,“In those days, the school did not have enough fund to employ cleaners, so Sir used to do the cleaning job himself. He even went from hostel to hostel seeking donation for the school.”Few years after joining, he was made the principal. Since then, the school has made a lot of progress under his tutelage. Only last year, he retired, devoting almost five decades of selfless service to the school. Mrs. Shalini adds,“I have never seen Gandhiji, for me Sir is his incarnation.”",

It has a total strength of 325 students unequally divided among the various classes with girls comprising nearly half of the total strength. A dedicated staff of 12 teachers work relentlessly to run the school. Over the years, their hard work has borne fruits.Abhishek Shuklaof Class 8 has developed a game using Scratch programming language as a part of the Google Code to Learn contest. Regarding his entry, his computer teacher, Mrs Nirupama says,“His project may not stand anywhere in the international arena, but it has stood upto my expectations, in fact surpassed it”.For extraordinary students likeAbhishek, there is a Beyond Opportunity School (BOS) programme through which 5 meritorious students from each batch get to join the school of their choice after passing out.",

      "Mr Santosh Kumar makes sure his class is interactive",
      "The school has a number of distinguished alumni who are flourishing in their respective fields, be it Engineering, Navy, Air Force or the Police. Two of the most noteworthy alumni areShubham Singh, who is a part of the National Target Ball Team and has represented India in overseas tournaments andArvind Kumar, an engineering graduate, who has made an award winning documentary, “Ganga tera Paani”concerning the plight of the river Ganga.",
      "",
      "The enthusiasm with which the teachers speak about the school and the kids is endearing. When we asked them their wish list with regard to the school,  they set about answering it with a renewed vigour. First and foremost they insisted on expanding the infrastructure, increasing the number of classrooms, because then they would not have to turn away the kids wanting to join the school. They also wanted an upgradation in the sports facilities, even hoped for a basketball court and a coach one day. The next thing on their list was a provision for nutritious mid-day meal along with health and personality development education. The one thing they iterated time and again was to ensure that the kids have enough scope to pursue their passion. The Academic Co-ordinator of the school says,“The kids here have a lot of talent. It is our responsibility to hone them. We want to give them the freedom to choose their ambition without any inhibition”.For this they called for dance, music and art classes on a weekly basis.",
      "When we asked the teachers to tell us about the kids, they summed it all up in one word,“Bindaas”(carefree).”We make sure the students learn without fear, hence we maintain a friendly classroom environment”, addsMr Santosh.This was confirmed when we watched him from a distance, teaching. We asked the kids just one question-what they aspired to become in future.The conviction with which they answered it, despite the inadequacy, would send a disoriented person into an introspection spree. We had come here to get a perspective on the life of the kids but ended up getting one on our own.",

      "Vivekananda Samiti(VS) is one of the oldest clubs under the Students’ Gymkhana functioning for over 40 years, thus spreading the message of Swami Vivekananda among the campus residents. In 2010, VS, which used to be a part of Cultural Council, was shifted to Presidential Council.",
      "In the 2nd special meeting of the Students’ Senate held on 27th August, one of theagendaitems was to consider the proposal by Gautam Pratap Singh, President, Students’ Gymkhana to dissolve VS as a club, because “most of the activities carried out by them do not fall directly under the purview of the Students’ Gymkhana and can be organized by various other forums.”(Quoted from the agenda item)",
      "In the meeting, the President informed the Senate that he had received complaint from some[1]students that the activities of VS tend to be associated with a particular religious belief; for not all students may share the same belief, Gymkhana should not endorse such activities. The President himself expressed concerned about a particular incident where an individual from All India Gayatri Pariwar[2]was invited by VS. For this issue is very subjective and may vary across individuals, Shubham Atreja, Chairperson, Students’ Senate, ruled out any more discussion on religious aspects.",
      "Moving on, the President pointed out various instances of financial mismanagement by VS. There were four major claims in this regard.",
      "In lieu of above mentioned points, the Senate felt  that the functioning of VS does not align with the vision of Gymkhana. Also, the Chairperson pointed out, because VS has been found in violation of the constitution in handling finances, it could not continue to be a part of Gymkhana. Hence, the Senate unanimously accepted the dissolution of the status of VS as a club under Gymkhana.",
      "Vox Populiinvestigated on the aforementioned charges of financial misconduct and found certain inconsistencies in the decision of dissolution.",
      "For point (1) and (2), the current and past coordinators of VS accepted their mistake. The ex-coordinator, Koustuv Ray, said that he was not aware that funds from external sources were meant to be notified to the Finance Convener.",
      "Regarding (3), the VS team presented a document toVox Populi, duly signed by the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA) and Abhimanyu Arora, President, Students’ Gymkhana 2014-15, that gave them permission for sale of sweatshirts(but not for mugs). When this was discussed with Gautam, he said: “I believe that the permission was still for the VS club and not for third party. Third party is only involved as a seller to clubs and not directly. However, I accept, there should have been more research into this issue and a committee could have been established to look into the finer details.”",
      "As for (4), regarding utilization of funds from Gymkhana Corpus, the VS team says that they went to the Director, requesting release of funds from the account of Dean of Resource and Alumni (DoRA), summing up to Rs. 2.4 lacs, that came in as a donation for VS from the 1989 Alumni Batch. According to Koustuv, the administration sanctioned release of an equivalent sum from the Gymkhana corpus, and perhaps, the funds were to be transferred from DORA account to the corpus. Koustuv said: “We didn’t wish to fall in the trap of figuring out which account to take money from. We were not aware of the technicalities. All we wanted was to make use of the funds donated for the Samiti.” AsVox Populisought clarification from Gautam, he said: “The Gymkhana Corpus has had no income in the last 2 years.” After talking to both parties, weconclude that this issue needs further investigation to find out who was responsible for this fiasco.",
      "“Vivekananda Samiti, had received funds from various sources. They may or may not have gotten the approval from their Executive. The may not have followed the procedures. But, at the very least, the money should have come as income to the Students’ Gymkhana account. The Finance Committee should have been informed and then money should have been spent as the normal budget is spent, with the permission of the Finance Convener, getting the bills duly signed and verified by the Finance Convener. However, this was not followed, which is a major lapse.” ~Shubham Atreja[3]",
      "Speaking to Vox Populi,Karthik Balasundaram (who has been a member of Finance Committee for one year; acted as Chairperson, Students’ Senate for a short stint; and has been the Finance Convener for two consecutive years) said: “In any case of financial mismanagement, the precedent is to give an official show cause notice to the accused, set up a Fact Finding Committee (FFC), and if the individual(s) is found guilty, the case is sent to Student Senate Affairs Committee (SSAC). I have done so in case of festivals. Never has the concerned organization been dissolved in such cases.”",
      "The Chairperson conveyed that a request was made by a general body member to set up a FFC.When the President was questioned regarding Karthik’s comment, he said: “As an executive, I have been given the right to look after the administration of the Council. This includes the right to form a club/hobby group, as well as a right to dissolve one. The Chairperson and Parliamentarian of this year, according to their interpretation of constitution found no space for a FFC. The Senate found the Samiti functioning was already in violation of many norms.”",
      "Vox Populinoted that the reasons (primarily financial mismanagement) that finally led to the dissolution of VS, were not mentioned in the agenda item circulated (as stated in the beginning). To that, Gautam responded: “The Senate, if it feels, can change the course of discussion on any agenda item, as long as there are no objections.” Sakshi Choukse, the present coordinator of VS, in this regard, said: “We were not informed about the specific charges of financial misconduct beforehand. Therefore, we were not prepared to defend them in the Senate.”",
      "What next?",
      "As per the draft minutes of the Senate meeting, the Senate unanimously accepted the dissolution of the status of VS as a club under Gymkhana. The President requested that it shall continue working as a club until mid-term review of Presidential Council. After the review, VS may be re-incorporated as a hobby group to cater to those activities that are directly related to community welfare. Also, note that even if it is not incorporated again, that does not mean Samiti cannot exist in the institute – the decision is about it not being under Gymkhana.",
      "The Chief Counsellor, Students’ Gymkhana (DoSA) had requested the President and the Chairperson, Students’ Senate to have an informal meeting with the Faculty Advisors of VS. It was stated by the President in the meeting that if the Chief Counsellor requests, there can be a review of the original decision before the minutes are ratified. The Chairperson has sent a mail to the Chief Counsellor highlighting the same. The reply is awaited.",

      "In response to a complaint filed with the Women’s Cell, six students of Hall-2 have been found guilty[1]by the institute authorities. The complaint was filed by two girl students citing ‘verbal, sexual, emotional abuse and public defamation’ in the skit performed during Hall day of Hall-2. The skit staged, as per reports, was vulgar in nature, and publicly insulted specific girl students. The Academic Senate, henceforth, has punished one student with a year-drop and five students with a semester-drop.",
      "The complaint once received, was investigated by the Women’s Cell, which then submitted its report to the Senate Students’ Affairs Committee (SSAC). In its recommendations, Women’s Cell mentions that ‘student members’ of the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) of Hall-2 should be punished for the act, as they found them guilty for dereliction of duty. SSAC, after considering the report, accepted it. In the report forwarded to the Academic Senate, SSAC recommended suspension of one student, who happens to be an HEC member, for a semester. Also, the student, along with two other HEC members be fined with a sum of Rs.50,000 each. The three students who were involved in script writing, be also fined the same amount. All these six students were recommended to be also placed on Disciplinary Probation until graduation. The committee also recommended that none of the student members of the HEC, along with the three writers, be allowed to hold any official posts in the HEC, gymkhana, festivals, clubs, alumni positions in the future. Further, all hall activities, including Galaxy and Hall day, be banned in Hall-2 for the next three years.",
      "Academic Senate, the highest decision-making body of the institute, after considering the report of SSAC, did not accept the recommendations in entirety but made changes based on the dissent noted in the report by 4 out of 9 SSAC members. First, the punishment for the student, who was suspended for a semester was escalated to a year. Second, instead of imposing fine of Rs.50,000 on the other five students, they were suspended for a semester. Also, the academic senate, instead of banning all ‘hall activities’ for three years, banned all ‘hall cultural activities’ for one year, in Hall-2.",
      "In order to discuss this case, an emergency meeting of the Students’ Senate was called upon on September 4, 2015. It was identified, that there exists major concerns with the entire procedure. First of all, the investigation of Women’s Cell was not appropriate. The UG Girls’ representative in the Women’s Cell was never invited to any of the meetings. By the time the UG representative got to know about the committee, the report was already forwarded to SSAC. It also came to notice that the PG Girls’ representative signed the report, without being actually present in any of the meetings. Also, it was alleged, that the students who were interrogated, were misquoted by the investigators, who carried their own biases.",
      "Dr. AR Harish, who happens to be the Dean of Student Affairs(DoSA) and Chairman SSAC, was made aware of the aforementioned problems. In his capacity as DoSA, he was expected to table the student concerns during SSAC meeting. And as Chairman SSAC, in the meeting of Academic Senate, he was expected to lay down relevant facts and provide the rationale behind the recommendations of SSAC. However, the Students’ Senate found that Dr. Harish failed to fulfil his responsibility in both roles.",
      "Another concern was raised during the Students’ Senate meeting – if the student members of HEC are being held responsible, so should be the warden, who happens to chair the HEC.",
      "Apart, as was argued in the Students’ Senate, there is a general lack of ‘scalability, consistency and clarity in deciding the punitive measures for students by the Academic Senate.’ Students’ Senate is of the opinion that if the Academic Senate had concerns about the recommendations of SSAC, either ‘it should be referred back to the SSAC’ or the ‘case should be discussed in its entirety in the Senate before making a decision’. Further, there is a no clarity on what punishment will be awarded for a given disciplinary misconduct.",
      "The Students’ Senate, in this emergency meeting, unanimously adopted aresolution, expressing ‘its discontent on the recent proceedings of the Institute bodies with regard to disciplinary matters concerning students.’ In the resolution, the Students’ Senate expressed its concern that ‘this may lead to a situation where the students’ general body starts feeling apprehensive about the way proceedings are carried out by the Institute bodies in disciplinary matters and may become reluctant to file complaints’ and requested the institute authorities to take necessary steps to resolve these issues.",

      "A lot of us wonder whether it’s too late to venture into startups? We also wonder whether the Indian market is saturated or are we approaching a startup bubble? And most importantly, how are startups evaluated? In order to address these questions, the Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kanpur organised a Panel Discussion on “Astronomical Startup Valuations – The math behind those billions” as part of e-Summit ’15 on 29th August.",
      "The panelist includedRitika Goyal-an investment executive withMatrix Partners,Chirag Kulkarni-the founder of an US based social media analytics firmInsightfullyandShesh Vasudevamurthy –director of product management withGroupon Asia-Pacific. The moderators for the discussion wereAshu Agrawal, director ofBusiness World AccelerateandRakesh Mishra, an alumnus of our institute and also the cofounder ofExcubator.",
      "The discussion kicked off with Ritika explaining the nuts and bolts behind startup valuation. Being an investment executive with Matrix Partners, a firm which has stakes in startups like TinyOwl, Ola and Practo to name a few, she stated that the ideal approach for valuation is a simple calculation based on the revenue and the growth rate of the startup. The fact that internet based startups, be it e-commerce or other internet enabled services are often valued much higher than other startups can be explained in terms of their significantly higher growth.",
      "",
      "Panel discussion in full swing",
      "However, valuation of startups have become more of an art rather than a science due to unavailability of actual data. When we talk about seed funding, it depends more on the negotiation between the investor and startup than strictly following the conventional approach.",
      "For an example, a Venture Capitalist firm buys 10% stake of a startup for say $20 million, the valuation would be simply based on the fact that, if 10% of the company is worth $20 million, then 100% of the company would be valued at $200 million.",
      "Shesh brought up the fact that a lot of startups are valued on the basis of their growth potential, especially if they are venturing into an untapped market. Though it is not necessary that the startup generates revenue right from the start but if it manages to dominate its market, a revenue model can easily be implemented and this gives investors the opportunity for a steady exit later on.",
      "An example would be the app based taxi services such as Uber, Ola etc where dominating the market primarily means winning over drivers by means of various incentives, thereby resulting in a larger network of drivers and hence better services.",
      "Chirag added that a lot of online startups undergo evaluation though they are not generating any revenue. This could be explained in terms of the growth potential of the company and also the number of users it has been able to reach on a monthly basis. Such companies could be valued by the number of unique users. For example, if a website has about 30000 unique visitors a month and let’s say we value them at $3 per user, the company would then end up with a valuation of about $90,000 in addition to the growth potential of the company.",
      "Chirag and Ritika went on to explain how the valuation of social media based startups are slightly more challenging than e-commerce startups, primarily due to the difference in their revenue models.",
      "One of the interesting questions brought up during the discussion by the audience was whether we are approaching a startup bubble in India.",
      "",
      "eSummit witnessing jam packed events and intent audience",
      "Ritika drew an analogy that in India, it is more of a froth rather than a bubble in the sense that all of the VC investments do not disappear in a shot. In India, there are only a few companies that have reached the billion dollar mark. When you compare this to a country like China, where over the last few years, a significantly higher number of companies were able to reach the billion dollar mark, the fact that there is a lot of potential in Indian markets is outlined, especially in the untapped sector.",
      "All our panelists agreed on the fact that if a startup has a growth rate of above 30% or perhaps manages to break into the market, especially an untapped one with huge potentials, funding would be a lot easier. They also mentioned that entrepreneurs should not begin their startups with the aim of acquiring some funding, rather they should do it to follow their passion.",

But ironically, there was no body that addressed the issue of career, which is of paramount importance to students.

CDC would equip the students with necessary skills to be able to improve their personalities and represent the institute in a better way.”",
      "CDC will also help students aiming for higher studies and research, by providing requisite information and know how on writing formal pieces, along with making available relevant resources.",

      "IIT Kanpur has been facing a space crunch for quite some time now. The demolition of Girls Hostel(GH)-2, led to a shortage of rooms for female students, even though GH Tower had been set up.",
      "Last year, female PhD students of two batches were housed in New Research Associate(RA) building – Y13 with single and Y14 with double accommodation. One of the reasons for space crunch was that the strength of Y13 female PhD students was way beyond usual, with around 80 girls in the batch, compared to over 40 in Y14 and around a dozen in the new batch of Y15.",
      "For the Y14 female PhD students were to be given single accommodation, and around 200 girls were expected in the Y15 batch(across all programmes of study), the institute was falling short of rooms, yet again.",
      "In lieu of that, it was decided to accommodate girl students in a newly constructed block in Hall-8. The block was constructed over the hostel football field; isolated from the main building.",
      "In a meeting held on July 2, 2015, the Hall-8 HEC approved the proposal in principle. Certain guidelines were laid down, in consultation with Hall-8 members, female representatives and the institute. That included a proposal to issue a separate I-card to the female residents, endorsed by the warden in charge, which has to be deposited with the lady guard at the time of entrance. Further, if any non-resident girl is visiting the hostel after midnight, double entry – both at the main gate and the girls block – be required apart from being escorted by a resident girl student. Also, it was suggested that separate I-cards be issued for mess, to avoid any misuse by non-resident students.",
      "The new block has 58 rooms, out of which 53 rooms were proposed to be allocated for residents and 5 rooms(with double accommodation) to be reserved for guests. Prevailing restrictions like 12 am to 6 am curfew were agreed upon to be upheld for movement between blocks. The common areas to remain accessible throughout; excluding the badminton courts, which were proposed to be closed for girls during 12 am to 6 am, for it is located between the boy’s block. It was decided that the resident girls will be represented in the HEC by at most two female representatives.",
      "Note that the aforementioned rules are not strict, but guidelines, that can be revised over time.",
      "Though a co-ed hostel has come up for the first time in IIT Kanpur, so is not the case with IITs in general.For instance, IIT Gandhinagar has introduced gender-neutral housing. As per newspaper reports, though one among the six hostel blocks has been reserved for girls, they are free to opt for a room in other blocks. IIT Bombay also has one co-ed hostel.",
      "Speaking toVox Populi,Samyak Jain, Convener of the Council of Students for Hostel Affairs, said: “This is an interim solution to the space crunch. Girls will eventually be moved to GH Tower-2, which is currently under construction. But that will take at least two years to be complete.”",

      "IIT Kanpur not only encourages students to pursue their academic goals, but also provides them with ample opportunities to follow their heart, to explore their extra-curricular interests. In line with this, a bunch of students have been working on a project named‘Raavayana’,which perhaps, is the first of its kind venture on our campus.",
      "Raavayanais a web series byHera Pheri Films. The story revolves around a broke stage director who returns to his college to find actors for his play ‘Raavayana’.",
      "",
      "The origin of this group is, surprisingly, linked to the institute academics. The Humanities and Social Sciences department offers a course ART105 – ‘Introduction to Art of Video Making’ ,which requires students to make short video assignments in groups.Hera Pheri Filmswas one such group.",
      "Summers on campus is the ideal time to indulge in pursuits one is passionate about. Some join the sports camp, some undertake projects with different clubs and some just while away their time on the beautiful campus. During this period, Aditya Raj Somani, an active member of dramatics club involved in both, writing and acting, and Mohit Mahore, a member of Dance club, thought of making a web series revolving around an idea that they had on their mind for around two years. After brainstorming with Prof. Satyaki Roy, instructor of the ART105 course, they came up with a plan to bring that idea to life.",
      "The script and the cast had to be finalized before the shooting, so they got down to writing at the earliest. Gundeep Kaur, again from the dramatics club, helped with the casting. The next step was to have a cinematographer on board. Anushank Jain, an active member of film club, fit the mould perfectly. He had a prior experience of cinematography, having already worked on important projects like the Campus Video, which,by the way, was an online hit. And so, moving past the initial hurdles, the ‘Raavayana’ team was all set to get the ball rolling. Further, the Cultural Council extended support, hence making necessary resources available to theteam. Around the first week of July, the shooting for ‘Raavayana’ began.",
      "Most of the actors in the series, have been members of the dramatics club – having performed in street and stage plays in the past. But acting in front of a camera is a different ball game altogether. Though multiple retakes are allowed to get that perfect shot, but  even a small error can be spotted easily. At times, the dialogues had to be delivered ad-lib. Cinematography plays a key role. Due to a shortage of shooting equipment and manpower, shooting off-campus turned out to be quite arduous.",
      "The crowd at places like Bara Sirohi coupled with the summer heat gave team Raavayana a tough time. When most of the shooting had been done, Prof Satyaki Roy introduced Samuel Rudy to the directors ofRaavayanato add a musical dimension to the series. The entire film score was composed in-house. Vishal, another member of dramatics club, stepped in at the last minute, to fill the gaps in narration. Shooting took place for around a month. The post-production work is on, and the web series is set to be released in five parts; with the first one already uploaded.",
      "",
      "“For once in their college life, every person should try their dream project with their friends. Who knows if they’ll ever get the chance again. ” – Vishal",
      "It is refreshing to see a project like this, with people having different skill sets collaborating to build something exciting. Best wishes to the entire team ofRaavayana.",

      "Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, believed that ‘the world will ultimately be saved, if it is to be saved, by the method and approach of science.’ With a vision to achieve industrial and economic freedom, IITs were set up: the one at Kanpur being the fourth in number, registered under Registration of Society Act XXI of 1860 on 2nd November 1959.",
      "Dr. PK Kelkar, the first director of IIT Kanpur, stepped in the city on 14th December 1959. A newly constructed wing of Harcourt Butler Textile Institute (HBTI) was made available to IITK to start functioning. Offices, classrooms, library, laboratories – all were housed there. The pioneer batch was composed of a hundred students, all males, individually selected by Dr. Kelkar from over 7,500 applicants for five disciplines – civil, chemical, mechanical, electrical and metallurgical engineering.",
      "9th August 1960 was the day when selected students were asked to report to the institute at HBTI premises, and the first set of lectures were delivered.",
      "Prakash Khemani, an alumnus of the pioneer batch, recalls his first day at IITK, in a memoir published in the first issue of Voices(e-magazine of the alumni of IITK), January 2013. The first lecture was held at the corner room on the first floor of new wing of HBTI. “The class assembled at around 11 AM, as an apprehensive and a bit shaken group of about 60-70 young men (out of the 100 admitted), waited anxiously for the professor,” recalls Mr. Prakash. Dr. MS Bhatnagar from HBTI, after introducing himself, delivered the first ever lecture of IIT Kanpur. He put forth a question, requiring students to put on their thinking caps – “When should one apply oil to hair – before a bath or after one?”",
      "The class was divided with three differing opinions, as Prof. Bhatnagar involved every student in the class as a part of the discussion. While a group argued to apply oil before bath and the other one for after, the largest group felt that it made no difference. “After a lot of discussions, lasting over an hour, he asked whether any student was aware of the underlying principle behind the question,” writes Mr. Prakash. Well, I will leave the question unanswered here, open for the readers to think through.",
      "Following this intriguing discussion, was Dr. Kelkar’s lecture. He shared his vision with the students and narrated the story of the institute’s birth. He explained the selection procedure as well, which was based on performance in high school. The first batch didn’t take the Joint Entrance Examination(JEE), which was started in the following year. Seats were allotted to top-scorers on a pro-rata basis – criteria being the number of applications received from respective boards.",
      "“He also told us about the IITs in general and his plans for IITK in particular. For most of us, it didn’t mean much. In those days, students were rarely, if at all, concerned about brand equity of their institute. The pleasant, reassuring and paternal manner in which Dr. Kelkar spoke, gave a sense of security to the entire bunch of apprehensive newcomers,” recalls Mr. Prakash.",
      "“He assured us that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a great building starts with a mound of dirt,” says Mr. Abhay Bhushan, a member of the pioneer batch.",
      "“The first batch of students who joined IIT Kanpur were the real torchbearers of its spirit which they passed on to the generations of students who followed them. All the old timers on the faculty, I imagine, must be remarking occasionally, particularly when they are wistfully recalling the past, that the first batch was, perhaps, the best batch.” ~Dr. PK Kelkar",
      "After these two lectures, the students moved to their hostels, at the Government Central Textile Institute (GCTI) in Gwaltoli. Mr. Prakash mentions, “Arrangements for food were not yet made. We used to get some sweet buns and butter from a vendor who came on a bicycle to old GCTI hostel at teatime, and had to go out to a ‘Maharaj’ joint, not far from the hostel, for dinner.”",
      "The residents of GCTI were generous enough to ensure that these new kids, being the first batch of a newly established institute, didn’t complain about the lack of “dear” seniors. On 9th August itself, the evening was reserved for “introduction” sessions. The freshers were expected to assemble at the senior side of hostel campus at night. “I have vivid memories of these ragging sessions, when a bunch of us on successive days, were woken up late at night and marched in front of a large group of Textile Institute seniors, who tried to intimidate us, by shouting at us and threatening to strip us and mete out other punishments if we did not obey them,” mentions Mr. Abhay. Poor folks, they were not graced with the “strict” anti-ragging guidelines, as are students today.",
      "As the clock kept ticking, the students got back to their rooms and fell into an unassuming slumber, I am not sure, how many of them would have realised, back then, the significance of the day they had lived. This marked the beginning of an era, the birth of a fraternity and journey of an institution, what would become the IIT Kanpur we know today.",

      "Student-Faculty interactionis something that comes up again and again during discussions about the shortcomings of our campus. We all feel that it is an important part of campus life but no constructive steps have been taken to achieve this objective.Vox Populidecided to take the initiative in this regard and started‘Campus Dialogue’to discuss issues and take opinions from the two most important stakeholders in IIT Kanpur.",
      "The first event in the series was held to discuss one of the most hotly debated topics on campus-‘Is Kanpur an asset or liability to IITK?’. All of us have heard of the glorious days when IIT Kanpur used to be the leader among the IITs, be it academics, cultural activities, placements, or any other field one can think of. IITK’s rich history and unique association with American universities allowed it to be the undisputed centre of excellence for a long time. We were the first to start the concept of a cultural festival among Indian Universities, which began as the CulFest, now Antaragni. Our academic mettle was recognised world over and IITK was the temple of research when it came to Indian universities. Numerous luminaries began their journeys in IITK. The list of achievements of IITK is never ending.But as time progressed, the other IITs caught up and now are giving IITK a tough competition for the top spot. “Companies don’t come to IITK for placements”, “IITK students don’t get good internships”, “MoodI and Rendezvous are much bigger than Antaragni” are some of the complaints that can be heard from students. And the common reason everyone cites is that we are in atier two city like Kanpur.",
      "The faculty panel consisted ofProf. Joydeep Dutta,Prof. Dheeraj SanghiandProf. Ishaan Sharma. Each of them gave some interesting insights into the issue and made the discussion a fruitful one. All of them agreed that there were some disadvantages because of IITK’s location but the advantages far outweighed them. Dr.Vimal Kumar, having been involved with the SPO, also attended the event due to his interest in the discussion and gave some valuable opinions with regard to the placement debate.",
      "One input that was common to all discussions was the lack of initiative shown by IIT residents, be it the students or faculty. Prof. Sanghi pointed out that IITK’s history of dominance had led to a laid back attitude which had percolated to all levels in the institute. He said that IITK had forgotten how to deal with competition, and that was where most of our problems stemmed from. The administration doesn’t recognise opportunities and even when they present themselves, it doesn’t do anything to seize them. He gave the example of a couple which applied to both IITK and IITB and their only requirement was quick approval of accommodation. Even though it would have taken IITB longer to provide accommodation to them, the Director of IITB went out of the way to give them what they wanted since both of them were valuable additions to the faculty. Nobody in the institute questioned his decision and even if they did, he was willing to defend it since the greater good of the institute was everyone’s priority. IITK, being one of the most democratic institutes in the country could not have went forward with such a decision because of the backlash it would have faced.",
      "Extending this argument to the students, Dr.Vimal said that the lack of preparation on the student’s part is primarily the reason many firms do not come to IITK because it is not cost effective for them. The other IITs are no doubt easier to reach but the quality of students in terms of their preparation is also much better. Dr.Vimal agreed that some issues do arise due to the geographical disadvantages of IITK but we still manage to perform well in Placements. The student to company ratio was the same in both IITK and IITB, around 4:1. The median salary was also comparable between both the institutes. The only parameter in which we lag behind is the number of Management and Consulting firms that visit IITK. But apart from that, this is an issue which is blown out of proportion most of the times. Lack of faculty in the institute is often blamed on the city since nobody wishes to come to Kanpur. The panel unanimously agreed that the institute is not taking any aggressive steps to market its advantages as compared to other IITs. Some disappointing instances were narrated by Prof. Sanghi that showed that it is our inertia and not the city which is holding us back. He mentioned that IITB had taken  a decision some time back to send a faculty member to all conferences even if he/she did not have a paper to present, just to increase awareness about the institute. When this idea was proposed in IITK, it was dismissed on the pretext that IITK did not need advertising. Only those who applied for faculty positions would be accepted and the institute would not go looking for them. Also, none of the faculty members actively advertise IITK in front of their peers, something that goes a long way in creating a positive impression.",
      "Another issue discussed is that of spousal employment, which becomes a hurdle while employing faculty. Again, Prof. Sanghi shared that there were numerous opportunities for employment which went untapped. The campus school, he said, is the biggest advantage that IITK has in this respect. Faculty spouses can be easily employed as teachers but they are paid even less than the cleaning staff in department buildings.",
      "Prof. Ishan raised the issue of IITK’s responsibility towards the city. He said since the institute was established, it has not taken up a single initiative to improve the city or it’s problems. Even if we do not want to do social service, there is a selfish motive behind improving the condition of the city and if we cannot do it for our advantage, then we are to blame. Since we do not contribute to the city, our voice is irrelevant to the city of Kanpur. He said that the inverted question, i.e. are we a liability was not at all illogical. We draw underground water from bore wells, more than thousand feet deep, for watering gardens while most of the city’s residents can’t even afford to dig them.",
      "The advantages of a small city were brought to light by Prof. Ishan. He narrated an incident from the time of the Ayodhya riots. A professor was stopped outside the IIT gate and asked to step outside his car. One of the men from the crowd recognised him as an IIT professor and asked everyone else to leave him alone. This privilege enjoyed by IIT faculty and students is unique to a small town. In metros like Delhi and Mumbai nobody cares if you are from IIT or any other college. Prof. Joydeep went on to say that small towns have a lot of adventures hidden for the people willing to explore.",
      "The discussion, a first for the students of IITK, resulted in a lot of misconceptions being cleared and new issues being tabled. The huge success of the pilot event has convinced everybody that a deep void has been filled and that this concept is here to stay.",

      "This might be counter-intuitive for many, but there is a difference between tolerance and acceptance.",
      "Being tolerant means that you don’t agree with a particular thing, maybe you consider it wrong. But you can live with it. You allow the existence of conflicting beliefs. Acceptance, is giving approval. No protest, no reaction. Tolerance indicates hatred, whereas acceptance maps to love.",
      "Yes, you can tolerate something without accepting it.",
      "“You can legislate tolerance – you can’t legislate acceptance. That takes a societal shift.”",
      "Talk about homosexuality. Is it ‘accepted’ by the community of IIT Kanpur?",
      "According to areportby The Times of India, anything between 2% and 13% percent of the population exhibits same sex preference.",
      "Food for thought : Going by numbers, how many homosexual individuals are there on the campus? There are over 6000 registered students in IIT Kanpur for this semester. If you are very conservative, taking the 2% mark, you will get an unrealistic number of 120 homosexuals.",
      "Now, what are the chances that one of your friend is still in the closet? Think about it.",
      "Well, if you believe that you do not have any homosexual friend, you might have done a numerical mistake. I encourage you to do the calculation again.",
      "",
      "Personally, I know of one homosexual student at IITK. Just one. I am pretty sure majority of the junta doesn’t know any. But how would we? Have we ever cared? Have we tried to build a community which accepts homosexuality? I find this concerning. We talk about it everyday. DOGA? It might be fun for you to tag your wingie with the title DOGA. But the way that term is used, is good enough for a homosexual to believe that our community just finds humour in homosexuality, forget accepting it.",
      "About 7% of the gay population is HIV positive, and homophobia against them make it more difficult to access health care. Suicide is rampant among young gay people who feel rejected by their family and friends – most of them are too afraid to speak out.",
      "Let me get back to the title of this post. From tolerance to acceptance. Let me give you an example. Tolerance is when institute “allows” one to bring a same sex date to say a ball night. Acceptance is when the classmates don’t whisper and laugh when you dance. Homosexuality needs to be accepted, not tolerated.",

      "David Carl Hilmers(born January 28, 1950) is a former NASA astronaut. Hilmers started as a three-sport student-athlete before graduating summa cum laude, moved on to become a Marines officer and then an astronaut. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51J (October 3-7, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22-30, 1992). Hilmers retired from NASA in October 1992 and has since devoted his attention a different kind of mission — mainly global health volunteer efforts, including pediatric HIV/AIDS projects in Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.",

      "VP:How was it like to grow up in a time when the Apollo missions motivated an entire generation of American kids to look towards a career in sciences?DH:It was really exciting. In a sense it was very interesting for people like me who were growing up in small towns and looked up to such things far away as kinda unachievable. I remember thinking to myself that it was something quite amazing but also something I would never be part of. It was inspiring; sort of so far beyond what we experienced everyday. But it was hard to believe that we could ever be a part of it.",
      "VP:Your second mission “Discovery” was the first mission to be launched after the unfortunate challenger incident. It was the most important launch NASA undertook after the Apollo 11. How was it like to be a part of that team?DH:It was a very difficult time. I remember we tried not to think about the possible dangers and what could happen. If we did that we would have gone crazy, would not have been able to focus on our work. So we tried to concentrate during training on the things that were in our control. We knew that we couldn’t control everything as the accident had shown. From my standpoint I felt honored that I was the part of the crew that would put America back into space. But yeah with so much publicity you try to train as hard as you could to make the mission a success.",
      "VP:You have work in medical missions around the world. You have treated people in poorest regions of the world. What is it that drives you to continue doing what you do?DH:I think that what keeps life exciting. Having a challenge and doing something to help people. What I do is interesting and it helps people. I recently worked in the e-bola health missions and felt that the way we worked there was ironically very similar to working in outer space; you get into a suit, cover yourself up, a single mistake can prove fatal so you are cautious. Similarly I find myself using my engineering skills in many medical situations. A lesson I have learnt is that all the experiences that you have in your life serve you at multiple times in entirely different areas.",
      "VP:How were your undergraduate years at Cornell College? Any incident that you remember and would like to share with us.DH:One of the things that set the stage for the rest of my life was that I used to get into things that were completely new to me. One such activity that I started was wrestling. Our school had an excellent program and I remember that in my first year when I started they would just kill me all the time; I’d always lose. But I was very determined that I wouldn’t quit. And after a couple of years of not being very good, I was quite decent. So in a sense throughout my life I looked back to it and always took my time to learn to get better at things, not being afraid, not giving up. My choice to leave NASA and join medical school at that age was very similar to this. It was something completely new but I took my time to learn new things even though I was uncomfortable for a while.",
      "VP:The Vietnam war was going on when you graduated, and you became a part of the Marine Corps. How did you feel about this? As you look back today, how did serving in the military shape you as a person?DH:When I look back to my time in the military, I wish that some things USA has done in wars, particularly Vietnam should have been done differently, but we learn from our mistakes.I think that the military taught me discipline pretty much the same way as I talked about getting out of my comfort zone in college. Also I think it gave me a young man’s structure, something that I didn’t have before. It also gave me an aviators checklist approach to a problem, something that I carried to my NASA days and now to medicine. My habit of organization has helped me a lot. Some might say it makes you too organized and stops you from thinking outside the box, but I don’t think that it ever limited me.",
      "VP:What would you like to say to the students of IIT Kanpur?DH:I would say that you should never let anyone tell you that you can’t fulfill your dreams because you don’t have good grades, or your personality is not suited to it or you don’t have a right background for that. If there is something you want, and if you work hard, then you will get closer to it. Another thing that I would like to leave with folks is that, if you devote your life to a certain career with the intent of helping someone, then it is a lot more satisfying compared to doing something for prestige or making a lot of money.This is one principle I’ve lived by and all I can say is I feel wonderful.",

      "TED is a global non-profit organization, which aims to promote sharing of ideas in diverse disciplines of life, ranging from business to technology to global issues and a lot more. TEDx are independently held TED events organized to help spreading ideas in communities across the world. TEDx IIT Kanpur is one such event conducted by Entrepreneurship Cell, IITK on anannual basis.",
      "The event began with the lighting of the lamp by Dr. B.V. Phani, coordinator of SIDBI Innovation and Incubation Centre, and Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur. This was followed by theDirector’s speech, in which he stressed the importance of innovation, and how we should all strive to create something new. In his own words, “In the recent years, we are extremely keen on pursuing innovation that leads to entrepreneurship”.",
      "The first speaker of the evening wasAbhijeet Awasthi, former National Creative Director of Ogilvy and Mather, India. He began by telling the audience about his adventures in life before moving on to advertising.He left us gaping when he showed some of the ads that have been his brainchildren – one of those was that of fevicol. The idea that he shared was that of thinking of ideas. Being in advertising for such a long time, he was used to ideation and using creativity to market products and services. He shared his algorithm of coming up with ideas that work: take an observation from life, use your imagination and you have the idea. He went on to show us the “seat belt crew” ad, where transgender people were urging the automobile drivers to use seat belts.",
      "The next speaker wasAmit Deshwal. He is an IITM alumnus of 2008, who quit his job at World Bank a year later to understand the meaning and forms of education and start a learning space for children that is different from formal teaching. He shared his agony about children of ages 2-3 years old being asked to join a formal school and be subjected to a regimented form of  learning, where they are not even asked what or how they want to learn.He has traveled through different parts of India for nearly three years, trying to understand the different styles of learning. This, he said, opened his mind to various aspects of the same. He narrated an experience of his when he had stayed with his grandmother for a month and a half in a village after his grandfather had passed away. He had understood that people learn those things very quickly which they need to, but most people have internalized the fact that learning happens only in schools and colleges, although they know quite a lot about the world around them. “Present education system is destroying the diversity of life on Earth.” He went on to tell the audience about Palak, a girl who he had met at Ladakh, and how she benefitted from an open school.",
      "The next man to take the stage wasAabid Surti, a national award winning author, artist, playwright and cartoonist. He started  off by telling the audience that his initiative, Drop Dead, had saved 6 million liters of water single handedly. Surti told us about  the kind of water scarcity that he and his family had to go through when he was a child, which was also the story of many  rural andsemi urban households at that time. Thus, he felt concerned about the voluminous wastage of water in households due  to leaking taps. So he decided to tackle the problem head-on. He, along with a plumber and a female volunteer, started visiting  houses every Sunday and fixing their leaking taps. He told us of his method – he took permission from the landlord of a housing  society on a Monday and put the “Drop Dead foundation” poster on the notice board of the society. On Saturday, he would  deliver a pamphlet in each house of the society with help from the watchman. Finally, his small team would visit the place on  Sunday and fix all leaky taps. He then encouraged the audience to also indulge in such social service. He emphasized the fact  that there are numerous problems in the world around us that need to be solved, and such acts of kindness can vastly improve  the world that we live in.",

      "TED is a global non-profit organization, which aims to promote sharing of ideas in diverse disciplines of life, ranging from business to technology to global issues and a lot more. TEDx are independently held TED events organized to help spreading ideas in communities across the world. TEDx IIT Kanpur is one such event conducted by Entrepreneurship Cell, IITK on anannual basis.",
      "",
      "The event began with the lighting of the lamp by Dr. B.V. Phani, coordinator of SIDBI Innovation and Incubation Centre, and Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur. This was followed by theDirector’s speech, in which he stressed the importance of innovation, and how we should all strive to create something new. In his own words, “In the recent years, we are extremely keen on pursuing innovation that leads to entrepreneurship”.",
      "The first speaker of the evening wasAbhijeet Awasthi, former National Creative Director of Ogilvy and Mather, India. He began by telling the audience about his adventures in life before moving on to advertising.He left us gaping when he showed some of the ads that have been his brainchildren – one of those was that of fevicol. The idea that he shared was that of thinking of ideas. Being in advertising for such a long time, he was used to ideation and using creativity to market products and services. He shared his algorithm of coming up with ideas that work: take an observation from life, use your imagination and you have the idea. He went on to show us the “seat belt crew” ad, where transgender people were urging the automobile drivers to use seat belts.",
      "The next speaker wasAmit Deshwal. He is an IITM alumnus of 2008, who quit his job at World Bank a year later to understand the meaning and forms of education and start a learning space for children that is different from formal teaching. He shared his agony about children of ages 2-3 years old being asked to join a formal school and be subjected to a regimented form of  learning, where they are not even asked what or how they want to learn.He has travelled through different parts of India for nearly three years, trying to understand the different styles of learning. This, he said, opened his mind to various aspects of the same. He narrated an experience of his when he had stayed with his grandmother for a month and a half in a village after his grandfather had passed away. He had understood that people learn those things very quickly which they need to, but most people have internalized the fact that learning happens only in schools and colleges, although they know quite a lot about the world around them. “Present education system is destroying the diversity of life on Earth.” He went on to tell the audience about Palak, a girl who he had met at Ladakh, and how she benefitted from an open school.",
      "The next man to take the stage wasAabid Surti, a national award winning author, artist, playwright and cartoonist. He started  off by telling the audience that his initiative, Drop Dead, had saved 6 million litres of water single handedly. Surti told us about  the kind of water scarcity that he and his family had to go through when he was a child, which was also the story of many  rural andsemi urban households at that time. Thus, he felt concerned about the voluminous wastage of water in households due  to leaking taps. So he decided to tackle the problem head-on. He, along with a plumber and a female volunteer, started visiting  houses every Sunday and fixing their leaking taps. He told us of his method – he took permission from the landlord of a housing  society on a Monday and put the “Drop Dead foundation” poster on the notice board of the society. On Saturday, he would  deliver a pamphlet in each house of the society with help from the watchman. Finally, his small team would visit the place on  Sunday and fix all leaky taps. He then encouraged the audience to also indulge in such social service. He emphasized the fact  that there are numerous problems in the world around us that need to be solved, and such acts of kindness can vastly improve  the world that we live in.",

      "Ramamurti Shankar (born April 28, 1947) is the John Randolph Huffman Professor of Physics at Yale University. His research is in theoretical condensed matter physics , although he is also known for his earlier work in theoretical particle physics.  He received his B. Tech in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and his Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics from the University of California, Berkeley. After three years at the Harvard Society of Fellows, he joined the Yale physics department, which he chaired between 2001-2007. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is dedicated to teaching and has published three texts: Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Basic Training in Mathematicsand Fundamentals of Physics.: A Fitness Program for Science Students.",
      "",
      "VP: Is this your ﬁrst time in IIT Kanpur? How has the experience been so far?RS: Yes it is. It’s been great.",
      "VP: You did your B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras and are now one of the most respected Theoretical Physicists in the international community. How did you make the transition from engineering to pure sciences? Was it tough?RS: It was tough because it was hard to get into IIT and once you get in you want to stay in. I had no intention of doing anything else. It is only by accident that I ran into some interesting books on Physics by Feynman. And I was reading them initially only for fun and then I realised that this is something I want to do. So I wanted to quit then and there but my father counseled me to ﬁnish what I had started. This happened in the middle of my second year. It was a ﬁve year B.Tech program. I had about three years to learn all the topics you need to go to Graduate School. So, when I ﬁnished my B.Tech, I gave the GRE and went to Berkley. It is a great place to go to because it is a very good school and yet it is big enough that it can take a gamble. They don’t know anything about me. I tell them I want to do Physics and all they have is my GRE score. Other places like Princeton which have a very small incoming batch, they will not take a risk because they have only twenty seats. Berkley has a big class, so they are able to take students from abroad in whom they take a chance.",
      "VP: What could be the reason for the research culture in India not being well founded?RS: I don’t know what the problems are. Money seems to be plentiful, as far as I can tell. That used to be an obstacle in the old days. Another obstacle in the old days was that journals took a long time to come here. After it was published, it took a few months to come here. Then you had to read the journal, then you had to think of an idea they nobody had, then submit it to the journal, if it was abroad, that takes another few months. Then it went to the referees, and ﬁnally the paper came out. You were about two tears behind everybody else. So, you had to be two years ahead in your thinking to make an impact. But now it’s instantaneous because of the web. All the papers we write are on the internet. That’s a great equaliser. That problem is gone. Apart from that, one problem that I imagine, which is not a problem in IIT is that researchers don’t see enough of students. They are all by themselves in the research institutions under the assumption that that’s the way to think clearly. I don’t share that view. I think it is better to have students who are always bugging you, asking questions. Going to class, teaching, you should mix the teaching and research. I think it is coming to that in many places.",
      "VP: Sir, another pertinent question these days is an increasing percentage of people who come to IIT do not eventually end up in technology sectors or science sectors; Banking and Consulting jobs lure them with lucrative packages. Being in the teaching profession what are your views on this phenomenon?RS: I know what you are saying; it’s a problem even in the US. Because in the graduate school we have only about twenty positions to offer. So we ﬁght about every single slot that we offer to graduate students. In the end after 4-5 years, they got to Wall Street; well is it a gain or a loss, I cannot say; I think what it does is in the end you ﬁnd what you are meant to do and if you evolve naturally, I’d rather not be the one to criticise. Look at my own life; I thought I was supposed to be an engineer but I found out I was supposed to be a physicist and if somebody would have stopped me, it would have been a loss to both parts of the world. So if somebody is a good banker and happens to go through the physics route or engineering route, I don’t see the problem as long as the motivation is not just making money and you do ﬁnd banking interesting. I’d rather have a technically sound person incharge of banking than someone who is not technically strong. If you are an engineer, you learn how to quantify, approximate and model things, you are convinced by logic and reason. They are good attributes for any ﬁeld; so I don’t think you should consider that a loss. It’s a little worry that people go and do something else; if they aren’t good at it they wouldn’t ask them to do it and if are good at it, you shouldn’t stop them from doing it. Now there are more seats in IITs so they can take more people.",
      "VP: What is your secret that makes you one of the most loved Physics teacher in the world?RS: I don’t really know the trick. I just like my subject a lot. I enjoy talking about it. Any number of times, any number of people. And I think they can feel my enthusiasm. Not everybody wants to teach. Specially in America, there is not much importance given to teaching. As an IIT student, I used to learn my subject and explain it to my classmates. And I fount thai it was very good for me. I also learnt it much better they way. And we had the culture of sharing what we knew in those days. And that helped me learn how to explain things. Another thing that I deﬁnitely owe to my IIT experience is Public Speaking. Although we didn’t have technical meets but we did have All India competitions like in debating. Debating is not part of your engineering education but it is invaluable. Once you can get up and talk to a crowd, that’s so useful when you are in a teaching profession. I don’t care if there a ﬁve, or ﬁve thousand or ﬁve hundred thousand people, you tune them out all together. And you learn to make your point in a limited time. There is no room for wasting time in the ﬁve minutes you have. I think that was very helpful. And that’s helpful even in my research because suppose you do a good piece of research. How much of it get’s recognised also depends on how well you are able to explain what you done to people. If you are invited to give a talk on what you did but if you go there and leave people in the dark, they don’t know what you did. Being able to explain stuff is not only useful in the classroom but elsewhere also.",
      "VP: What is the message that you would like to give out to the students here in IIT Kanpur?RS: It’s not a simple answer because I can give you some generic empty words. I advise a lot of people when they write to me but they are one on one based on the situation. I don’t have a general answer. You’ll hear enough of that when you graduate. But I do know that in my own case, I changed my ﬁeld when it was risky thing to do and I ended up okay. Is it going to be everybody’s story, I don’t know but my guess is that it is easier now then it was then. I have a student who did his Electrical Engineering from Madras and joined the Yale Physics Department. He is the best student to ever work with me. And we took him in without any question. It’ s a lot easier when your predecessors have proved their value. I do not have any advice for you guys, look at the festival you are running. But I do have advice for the politicians, leave the IITs alone. They are fantastic places. Everyone asks me, “What’s the secret?”, I say, look, we know it’s a big country. It’ got many great people. What you don’t want is someone coming in between the great people and their opportunities. You want meritocracy. When I was growing up in Madras, there was a lot of regional politics regarding admission onto various regional colleges. IIT was a lighthouse of hope for us because anybody could compete and if you got in it didn’t matter where you were from. It’ purely based on merit. It’s a very simple secret and it is as powerful as anything I have ever seen. At Yale we have a very complicated admission process. Some of it on grades, some of it on extra curricular activities, this and that. IIT is based on this one number, which is your total score. It looks very one dimensional, but it is very fair because if you look at the end product. There is an old American saying, “If it ain’t broke, don’t ﬁx it”. So, it is working well, leave it alone.",

      "Professor Harald Rose is a pioneer in the field of electron microscopy. He won the Wolf Prize for Physics in 2011, with Maximillian Haider and Knut Urban, for developing aberration-corrected electron microscopes. Professor Rose has had extensive research experience in The Enrico Fermi Institute, Cornell University, the New York Stated Department of Health, etc, and currently holds a Senior Professorship in the University of Ulm. Following is his conversation with Vox Populi, where he recounts the triumphs and obstacles of his research experience and gives us an insight into his multi-faceted personality.",
      "",
      "Vox:What inspired you to take up science as a career?Prof. Rose:I wanted to understand the laws of nature. After the war, there was no money,  and and Science was not a popular career choice. Initially took up engineering at the University of Darmstadt. I realised,  however, that it was not for me. I wished to go into the depth of concepts and understand the laws. I was gifted in Mathematics, and so shifted to studying Mathematics and Physics simultaneously and obtained Bachelor’s degrees in the same.",
      "Vox:What events lead you to pick electron microscopy as a research subject and what obstacles did you face?Prof. Rose:While studying theoretical Physics, I was introduced to theoretical optics. It was the end of the 30s and the light microscope had reached its limit, since it could not be used to see viruses. Around that time, the first electron microscope was being built. It brought about a revolution in medicine as it lead to the discovery of AIDS virus etc. My Master’s thesis was on electron scattering to trace image contours. For my PhD thesis I addressed the problems in the resolution of electron lenses. For example, consider a champagne bottle. The lens formed when it is sliced across its widest part performed better than an electron lens. I discovered that correction of the resolution would require working with mechanical and electromagnetic instabilities, not aberrations.  I concluded that a compact lens with fewer elements would solve the issue at hand. However, at that point, the prevailing scientific opinion among American scientists was that this line of research would not be fruitful. This influenced world opinion and obtaining funding for this line of research became very tough. The Volkswagen Foundation, set up to fund scientific research, headed by Steinhart, who was a mentor to me, saw the potential in my proposal and agreed to fund it. Interestingly, it was one vote among nine, that is, a 5:4 ratio, that swung the vote in our favour. If it wasn’t for that, none of this would be happening; we were very lucky.",
      "Vox:How was your experience at Techkriti and India?Prof. Rose:Initially, I was a little worried about visiting India. I was told multiple times to be careful with regards to food and safety, give  my health.  However, I have found the campus to be perfectly agreeable and find it on par with the campuses of American universities. I have also developed a liking for Indian food.",
      "Vox:Would you like to say something to the physics students of the institute?Prof. Rose:I would only like to say that the current generation of students must possess endurance, devotion and new ideas, because these are essential to scientific research and advancement.",
      "Vox:The Internet tells us a lot about your academic achievements, we would like to know, if it is okay with you, who the real Harald Rose is.Prof. Rose:I still play tennis thrice a week. Till five years ago, I also used to hike and ski, however, now heights are not conducive to my health. I also enjoy classical music.",

      "This is an anonymous opinion voiced by a concerned student. It revolves around the decision of the committee to confer the Institute Blues award, the highest honour for sportsmen of the graduating batch. Comments by the General Secretary, Games and Sports Council of 2013-14 and 2014-15 follow up the opinion piece. This year, Aditya Ranade, who has brought laurels to the institute in Tennis, has been rewarded with the honour. The author argues that two other deserving players have been left out. The views conveyed in the article are solely of the author. The opinion section of Vox Populi provides a platform for the campus junta to voice their opinions.",
      "IIT Kanpur has had a memorable run in the past two Inter-IIT Sports meets. While we had a watershed moment in the 49th meet hosted by IIT Guwahati where we won the General Championship for the first time ever, we strengthened our dominance by retaining it in the 50th meet hosted at IIT Bombay. This has been possible only because of the unwavering dedication of our athletes not only in the past two editions, but also in the earlier meets. They came together not only as a team in the sport they played but also as an contingent to orchestrate and lift the cherished GC crown. Momentum was built over several editions, countless cramps were braved and performances were synchronised to peak at the perfect moments. It was not just the sweat but also the tenacious mental make-up exhibited by our athletes that brought us glory.",
      "And thus it saddens and shocks me immensely at the kind of recognition (or lack of it) the SPEC (Sports & Physical Education Committee) has decided to confer upon some of the superstar performers of the graduating batch. For the people unfamiliar with the process, institute organises a felicitation ceremony every year in recognition of the performances and spirit of all sporting teams. Exemplary athletes of the graduating batch, who have wowed everyone with their performance and commitment to sporting culture are awarded with ‘Institue Blues’ – an award of topmost prestige. And two such performers of the outgoing batch are refused this recognition on extremely vague and insensible grounds during the felicitation scheduled on 28th March. Here lies the core of my resentment.",
      "I won’t shy away from taking names. Parth Tripathi from Aquatics and Rai Singh Meena from Athletics are players with performance personified. Both of them have led their teams from the front and have been representing our institute right from early years of their stay in campus. Both of them have a count of Inter-IIT medals in double digits individually. And to put a cherry on the top, both these players have Inter-IIT records in their name. They have continued and cultivated a culture of high standards in their respective teams which neither the existing members or the sporting alumni can question. Refusing them Institute Blues is a slap of insult on their contribution and dedication. I would also like to mention the cases of Devanshu Arya from Cricket and Ankur Singh from Hockey. Devanshu has been a key player of our team for the past four years and has single-handedly turned matches in our favour on innumerable occasions. Similarly, Ankur has been a regular at Inter-IITs right from his first year. He has played 5 Inter-IITs and has been an indispensable part of the team. Both these stars have been denied ‘Best Outgoing Sportsman’ award and have been clubbed with players with just a single Inter-IIT to their name 3 years back in the ‘Special Appreciation’ category. This is shameful and despairing.",
      "I feel outgoing Games & Sports Council General Secretary Chirag Agarwal could have avoided this fiasco. To begin with, Chirag was very adamant on capping the number of Institute Blues awards. I feel this is quite ridiculous and the number of Institute Blues awarded in a particular year should only be determined by the quality of performers in the out-going batch. This has been the tradition and legacy associated with the award right since its inception. Denying Institute Blues to a Parth Tripathi does nothing but dilutes its prestige. His arguments regarding capping the number of awards revolves around the discontent expressed by alumni last year and committee decision following the incident. But I want to take this medium to remind him that alumni weren’t unhappy about the number of Institute Blues conferred. Rather it was about a very specific candidate who was conferred the award. And there exists no written record to cross-check his claim of committee decision. Another error from Chirag’s end has been a visible discord between what he has been communicating to students and the SPEC. While he has been extremely vocal supporting Parth’s nomination for Institute Blues publicly, it is surprising he didn’t resist SPEC decision with matching vigour. Given the structure of institutions, his position does hold influence in SPEC which finalises the awardees. His office has a crucial role in conveying and convincing the SPEC members to formalise the candidature of nominations forwarded by the student body. This is because unfortunately, as things stand, SPEC consists of several members who have negligible interaction with the sporting contingent. They have little idea about time, energy and focus that the contingent puts in. And they don’t even visit Inter-IIT tourneys. And going by the outcome, it seems Chirag has failed to do his job thoroughly in the SPEC meeting. I could only conclude that there is an encyclopedic gap between his genuine intentions and actual actions.",
      "Majority of students that join a team do not have sports background. They pursue sports with sincerity and dedication and seeing their seniors get their due recognition is an immense motivation booster. Ignoring someone who are idols in their respective teams based on their performance, conduct and looked up by teammates for motivation and guidance, will set a bad precedence. It’s flawed to consider that someone who isn’t a part of the council is devoid of any leadership skill (another arbitrary reason provided by SPEC on rejection of Parth and Rai Singh) and hasn’t in anyway contributed to the contingent.",
      "This rant is not to just bring attention to the injustice meted out to some of our celebrated athletes. This is about preserving the sporting culture. A culture that existing contingent as well as our alumni strived hard to develop and imbibe in the campus. And this move, at a time when we have won back-to-back GCs, will suffocate and nip this culture in the bud.",
      "NOTES:",
      "In order to maintain the prestige of the Institute Blues award an ex-captain (not the author) feels that –",
      "As a mark of protest, Aquatics and Athletics teams had already boycotted the Captains’ Handover ceremony. In response, only an informal meeting was organised by the administration. They are trying to trivialise a serious situation.",
      "Aquatics team have decided to boycott Sports Felicitation Ceremony as well.",
      "Samarth Bansal from Vox Populi spoke toChirag Agarwal, outgoing General Secretary, Games and Sports Council andAnant Mundra,who served as the same during 2013-14. Here is what they had to say:",
      "Chirag feels that the Institute Blues award should be given to at most two students. According to him, increasing the number will just dilute the prestige and value associated with the award. Chirag conveyed that last year, when four awards were given out, it was on the condition that next year, the number will be restricted to two. (The above statement can’t be verified though, as it was not minuted). As a General Secretary, he says that there is just so much he can do, and the final result is not his own dictat, but a decision made by the committee. He agrees that Parth Tripathi should have been a recipient owing to his exceptional performance and he tried his level best for the same.",
      "This is what Anant had to say – “There is no cap on the number of Institute Blues awards being given out. But it being the most prestigious award, there has been a trend that it is generally given to 1-2 people. But whoever is deserving, should be given the award. It can exceed 2 because the performance of the contingent has improved over the recent years and there are bound to be more star players than before. So now the conflict of interest lies here that the prestige of the award should not reduce over the coming years. Students gymkhana works a lot on precedent. Now if this year they give 3-4 institute blues then next years even if we perform bad, they will make it a trend to give 3-4 Institute Blues. So basically the prestige of the award and its exclusivity should not reduce over the years which has happened with the awards which are given apart from institute blues.”",
      "",
      "The Vox Populi team would like to direct the attention of our readers to the fact that prime responsibility of deciding the awards lies with the SPEC Chairman, as SPEC is the deciding committee. The General Secretary acts as a student representative in the committee, and puts forwards the recommendation made by students. As students, we have all the rights to question the administration, if the students are suffering due to their work. We plan to speak to the SPEC Chairman in the next few days, and will update everyone accordingly.",
      "Given the importance of the issue in context of the sporting culture of campus, we invite thoughts from the junta. We encourage you to post your comments in the discussion thread or write to us at contact@voxiitk.com.",

      "Vijay Kumar(born April 12, 1962) is an Indian roboticist and UPS foundation professor in the School of Engineering & Applied Mechanics with secondary appointments in Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and will become the new dean of Penn Engineering from July 1,2015. Prof. Kumar is known for his research in the control and coordination of multi-robot formations. He is an alumni ofIIT Kanpur, graduated in the year of 1983. Prof. Kumar was awarded the Distinguished Alumnus Award last year by IIT Kanpur.",
      "",
      "Vox Populi got the opportunity to interview him after the award ceremony and his lecture.",
      "(Prof Vijay Kumar – Prof. Kumar:)",
      "Vox: Good afternoon,Sir.Prof. Kumar: Good Afternoon.",
      "Vox: Sir, tell us about your involvements in the various technical activities while you were here.Prof. Kumar: I didn’t do any of that .I remember, my activities were mostly musical. We played in a band and we had an audio club too, where we used to tinker around with things. We used to provide audio for all the big events and even make new instruments. We also had a lights club",
      "Vox: And what did the lights club do?Prof. Kumar: Nowadays everything is off-the-shelf but back then they had to be made. You can imagine it as having lots of lights and then wiring them up .It was a great way to earn practical knowledge. There was a HAM club as well as an electronics club that was pretty active. We didn’t have Techkriti back then but the cult fest was quite popular.There were hall days and we used to have Inter -hall cultural competition.It was called galaxy.",
      "Vox: Something in particular you remember about them ?Prof. Kumar: The bollywood talk line about the “Liquid Oxygen main duba dunga…..” – that was our line and they stole it.That actually went on to beget lines as “Is aadmi ko Pakad ke Liquid oxygen me daal do.. Oxygen isko marne nai degi aur liquid isko jeene nai dega (Dump this man in liquid oxygen. The liquid won’t let him survive, the oxygen won’t let him die)”(Everyone laughs)",
      "Vox: So when did you enter into the field of Robotics?Prof. Kumar: Oh that is another story . There are a lot of random events in my life. I just picked things up as they came my way. While I was here, I wanted to work on heat transfer, solar energy, heat exchanger design etc. because I thought energy was the next big thing. But then when I went to Ohio State, I met Ken Waldron, who would later become my advisor. He sold me the field of robotics. It was an upcoming field with something new.",
      "Vox: So you had no kinship with Robotics while you were an IIT student?Prof. Kumar: There were two things I was interested in when I was in IIT. One was heat transfer and the other was aircraft. The whole idea that a computer can fly a plane i.e. autopilot was very interesting to me. In those days the autopilot were used only for inter-continental flights. I was very interested in it and so i took up Aerospace Engineering when I joined IIT. And then my Seniors told me there is no market in India for Aerospace Engineering. Due to this and partly because my father was in Mechanical Engineering I switched to Mechanical. You know back then you had much less information — no internet. So what you learnt, you learnt by talking to faculty mentors and by talking to senior students.",
      "Vox: So how did your shift to Aerial Robotics and Swarm Robotics come about?Prof. Kumar: That story is a concrete one. In my PhD thesis I worked on a walking machine and that walking machine had 18 joints. Back then we had Intel 8086 processor which had a clock speed of 0.5Mhz. So, you could not write a control software that could control more than one joint on a single board which meant that you had to have 18 Intel 8086 computers and a 19th one to just pass messages between them thus making them coordinate with each other. In effect you had eighteen independent joints swarming together to make the vehicle move. So I started thinking about it back then and then when I left Ohio State University and I went to Univ. of Pennsylvania, I couldn’t work on walking machines because they were expensive. So,I started building multi fingered grippers and multi arm manipulators. And again every arm is independent and you had to figure out how to make them cooperate. That actually went on to mobile robots swarming.",
      "Vox: That’s a pretty solid way to experience the importance of swarm robotics. How did aerial robotics get introduced?Prof. Kumar: Aerial robots came a long time later because the invention that made it all possible was the accelerometer and then if you go back and look at why the accelerometer became so inexpensive you, will find that it was because finally the MEMS technology became mature and car manufacturers in US decided to deploy airbags and then every car had an airbag and there were lots of MEMS accelerometer being sold. Suddenly, the price of MEMS accelerometer came down and thats what made small UAVs possible.",
      "Vox: Ok,why do you think we are not developing new products in the field of robotics in India? I mean there is a lot of good research on robotics going on over here but not so much of indigenous products in the market.Prof. Kumar: I personally think there is a lot of brain drain from the tech sector to non-technical sectors (someone said “financial”). When I came to the reunion ,I talked to the top three students on campus.It is true they were working in a tech field but it was clear they were interested in careers in completely different fields. I remember when I graduated people like me were criticized because IIT was training us and we were leaving the country to go to the US. But at least people like me stayed in the tech area, and contributing to education and advances in technology. Technology does not know geographical boundaries, and there should be incentives to recruit and retain smart young people in science and technology.But you know now you have an innovation-incubation centre like SIDBI, I think things are changing and there are a lot of small startups and if one of them makes it big, suddenly everyone will want to create startups.",
      "Prof. Venkatesh: Let me tell you what is actually happening. A lot of modern technology is being built from materials off-the-shelves. As you said I also believe in getting things off the shelves to build things.But in this way you are never going to build a good motor, even if you try . So there is really no success in this sector.",
      "Prof. Kumar: That is not necessarily the only road to innovation. Innovation is mostly about novel ways of integrating components and subsystems.",
      "Prof. Venkatesh: Yes say you start a company and you make something , you will need to sell at least 50,000 products to keep your company standing and that is very difficult in India. Here, the markets aren’t that big. We can’t sell robots, we aren’t competitive for that reason. These typical marks,I believe we can’t reach because the markets aren’t that big.",
      "Prof. Kumar: Oh come one, India innovates in softwares and are really booming in it.",
      "Prof. Venkatesh:Precisely,in things which don’t require material.",
      "Prof. Kumar: That’s true even in the US. Remind me, I will send you the article about how “Hardware is the new software“. Software is something you can build in a garage or in somebody’s room. Hardware is becoming like that too. I believe in it. I think there will be startups in Robotics and if one of them makes it to success there will be a huge boom and by success I mean they have a good story and a high profile. They will have one soon and then Robotics will grow as a field to innovate in.",

    "content": [
      "Automation systems form an ubiquitous part of the modern world, embodying the essence of the IT revolution by eliminating the need of human labour and streamlining various processes. IIT Kanpur aspires to be a world class institution in its own right; a dream which can only be realized if it has an efficient automation system running behind-the-scenes. The need for a proper automation system is felt across all domains in the institute, in fields as diverse as administration, auditing, accounting, Students’ Gymkhana, academics and placement, to name a few. Various attempts have been made in the past to come up with standalone solutions, which have resulted in a patchwork of fragmented solutions, which fail to fit in properly in the big picture. In this article, we look into some particular areas where the lack of a proper platform is hurting the institute and its stakeholders in more ways than one.",
      "",
      "Handling registration alone has become a Herculean task, thanks to the sheer number of students and limited time allocated to the process. Automation was inevitable in almost everything. It seems that authorities did start out with a noble cause but were not entirely successful in maintaining the then built system. IIT Kanpur’s OARS was born as a consequence of a B.Tech. Project. The idea was simple, automate the registration process. Although OARS might have been constructed on the state-of-the-art technology back then, but technology has evolved to more quicker and efficient forms, leaving our beloved OARS burning away its precious oil under unprecedented load.The journey begins with an amazingly well organized HSS lottery, which failed to allot a small, yet significant, chunk of student candidates any HSS in the last semester’s pre-registration. Period of choosing electives, which is of significant importance to a lot of students, is the next in line. It acts as a primary hiccup for two major reasons. Students are not aware of the graduation requirements, and how would they be? Finding latest UG/PG manuals is a tough nut to crack. It fails to sink in, why such life-changing templates are not made available, at least before add-drop period. If that is not enough, OARS tends to crash at atleast one point of time during any sort of registration procedure. Maybe students tend to delay their form submission till the fag end of the allotted time-period, but they are not the only ones at fault. Some professors take a lot of time to accept/reject courses, hence causing a bottle-neck for form submission.",
      "",
      "Apart from OARS, Brihaspati-LMS comes neck to neck in performance. Its character can be judged by a highlighted message on the login page. Needless to say, with 4 people (in)active on the website and login time being more than 6 seconds,  users’ confidence go down instantly. Fortunately only a few students, yet a significant number, are the guinea pigs of this torturous experiment each semester. With over 60 lakh rupees worth of grants from the government (effectively tax-payers’ money) for Brihaspati-LMS in the past 4 years, we have yet to see a functional website which does not crash under the pressure of students from just one course. Moreover, there exists a website which requests for donations for Brihaspati. When we tried to give a small amount towards its “development”, it turned out to be surprisingly non-functional.",
      "",
      "Academics aside, another issue students flinch from; getting signatures, especially from the DOAA or DOSA. It is generally easy, as long as we are able to locate them. The newly formulated LHC online booking portal has failed to fulfil its purpose, primarily due to this problem. LHC bookings require permission from the DOSA after 1800 hours to sanction overtime payments for the LHC staff. Hence online bookings are not at all accepted by the LHC office, bringing the situation back to square-one. Digitizing signatures of faculty, staff and even students would be a complete game-changer in every aspect possible. With lesser running around for signatures and accountability being backed-up online, one mundane task could be put rest once and for all.",
      "",
      "There are other issues about which one could go on rambling, but the crux of the situation lies in the archaic functionality of almost all automation systems. All of the above issues, and many more, have been discussed in the Students’ Senate with short-term and long-term proposals being delivered to the concerned authorities. In the past years, half-hearted attempts to rejuvenate the system by the authorities have also met disastrous failure.",
      "",
      "However, there appears to be a silver lining to this dark cloud. The institute is actively pursuing the idea of getting a third-party backed comprehensive, robust and institute-wide automation system. An elaborate process, which started in early 2014, is currently in the pipeline with Prof. Mahendra K Verma of the Physics department at the helm of the committee constituted by the institute to overlook the entire operation. The committee collected the requirements from various stakeholders of the institute, over a period of several months. Students’ Gymkhana also pitched in with its fair share of stipulations, via a committee constituted by the Senate. Major areas where the committee feels automation is needed include finance, booking of resources, payment gateways, mail groups, event management and complaint management.",
      "",
      "Apart from the requirements of the students, the system is planned to be a one-stop solution to all the issues plaguing the administration and management in the institute. Prof. Verma informed us that the committee has forwarded a list of requirements for the potential bidders. The list is quite eclectic, covering an extensive range of modules across departments. The administrative modules include finance, offices of the Deans, department offices, auditing, etc. On the other hand, academic needs contain classroom and learning management systems, admissions, courses and grade management, scheduling, etc. Research Project Managment has also been given considerable attention. External connect services, including placements, internships and alumni relations are also covered in the tender requisites. Special emphasis has also been given to the services management systems, like IWD, HC, ID cell, security, transport, guest houses, etc. Prof. Verma is quite hopeful that the final system will cater to the wishes of every member of the institute in a satisfactory manner.",
      "",
      "The ambitious project has been planned to be launched over various phases, with the first phase including the modules for DORA and DOFA expected to be ready within a year. Although the student community is not likely to be significantly affected by these modules, subsequent phases are expected to be completed within a few years. The developer is also expected to provide management and logistical support for an extended period, housed in the institute. After the debacle of the institute website, we just hope that the institute has matured in its approach for such large scale projects. That being said, it is quite refreshing to see the institute taking an active stand on major issues and tackling them head on. Whether this approach bears some fruit is something that only time will tell.",

As they say, “Getting to the top is tough, but staying there is tougher.” Last year, we had won the Men’s GC, and had finished first in the overall tally. This time around, not only did were we aiming to retain that trophy, we also had our eyes set on the Women’s GC.",

      "The athletics events and league matches in other sports commenced on 13th morning. The first day was more of a cruising ride, with all the teams (except Squash boys and the Tennis girls) able to win their matches comfortably. The squash loss of our formerly silver-medal winners was a huge setback, as it made their pool tougher in the semi-final stages.",

The Tennis boys team put forth a solid performance against Madras in their last group match, winning 2-0. Volleyball boys won a thrilling encounter against hosts Bombay amidst loud cheering and electrifying support for both sides.

      "The quarter-final junction is a crucial phase, as getting more teams into the semifinals greatly increases the odds of placing first in the overall standings. Unfortunately, our contingent faltered massively at this stage. In the boys’ matches, we lost in Basketball to Kharagpur 46-47, Cricket to Delhi by 8 runs, Football to Hyderabad 1-0, and Volleyball to Madras 3-2. The girls lost Table Tennis to Bombay and basketball to Kharagpur. But there was a silver lining. Badminton cruised through to the semi-finals in both girls and boys.

Badminton boys fought their way past Bombay and entered the finals.  Squash boys were on the verge of clinching a final spot, just 5 points away from it in the 3rd singles.

Bombay lost all 5 of its matches, and we struck when it was most required: tennis boys and badminton boys pulled off great, victories getting gold medals. This added the decisive 20 points in our GC Tally.",

Even our Hon’ble Prime Minister, once being released of all charges by the Supreme Court, is still questioned about the Gujarat riots. And thus, it is valid if people are questioning him as a CEO after clearance from the SSAC.",
      "Another claim has been made regarding ‘successful conduction’ of the By-elections. Just like some years we have fabulous Antaragni and some years an average one. The mere conduction of an election should not be confused with ‘successful conduction’. If someone wants to dig deeper, he/she must conduct a little survey or field work to know the ground realities. Hence, this point nowhere qualifies to prove or disprove his capabilities as CEO. So here we are where we cannot say anything about his suitability for the post. But one out of the two things is for sure, either he is an innocent poor chap who has to go through so much over a period of one year or he brought all this upon himself through his acts.",
      "Let’s come to the second issue. Which institution is there to challenge the decisions made by the senators? And I am not ready to accept that any general body member can challenge it. I mean, one can, as mentioned by the Chairperson in anarticlepublished on Vox Populi, but if this would be pragmatic, there would not have been any concept like that of a Judiciary. Now if the Senate were to be completely autonomous body without any institution for reviewing its decisions, then it would be more powerful than the Parliament (even the Parliamentary laws are subject to judicial review).",
      "It is not reasonable to ask us to agree with all the decisions of the Senators even if they are our representatives. They are also humans and they can make mistakes. Hence, in such a scenario, in order to protect the interests of the Institute, I think the Institute administration has to intervene sometimes, especially if what it wants is just to separate some controversial names from such positions of high accountability and responsibility. It is important for us not to consider it just as the issue of interference in working of the Senate; the purpose of the intervention should form the background for judging the whole matter. If the Senate has failed in its responsibility to keep its matters straight without any unnecessary controversy, then who is there to force it to mend its ways if not the administration?"

      "An eye-catcher at the event, the vehicle received critical appreciation in design, clean packaging and low weight. The judges from the US were stunned to see the amount of brilliance reflected in the vehicle, and remarked that it had the potential to be a good competitor in international events. Further, the SAE team was informally invited by the judges to participate in a similar event held in Auburn, USA.",
      "The car is powered by a Briggs and Stratton 305cc engine coupled with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and a FNR gearbox. This setup gives a peak Torque of 560 N-m after final reduction, making the car capable of climbing an inclination of 41 degrees from a dead stop. There is a customized manual gear-shifter for easy and responsive gear shifting. Maximum tested speed of the vehicle so far is 55 kmph, which will increase with further testing and tuning. The vehicle has an adjustable double wishbone suspension at the front and a 3-link trailing arm suspension at the rear. It has 4-wheel hydraulic disc brakes with custom designed rotors, which are capable of producing a deceleration of 0.9g. An ergonomically designed pedal assembly facilitates driver comfort, and has large traction forces for a safe ride in off-road conditions.",

      "The project to build this off-road automobile began in December 2013 under the mentorship of Dr. Avinash Kumar Agrawal. Having formerly concentrated on building a formula racing, this was undertaken as the next big venture by SAE.",
      "Extensive use of the manufacturing facilities of Tinkering Lab and the Central Workshop was made by the SAE team. Some parts of the car were manufactured in the 4i Lab and a few components including the engine, gearbox, wheels, and tyres were either outsourced or procured from abroad at discounted rates. The team was sponsored by IIT Kanpur, Engine Research Lab IIT Kanpur, Crystal Metals, Magod Laser, Dassault Systems, Wilwood, Fox and JP Enterprises.",
      "After working hard for a year, the project attained completion. On 26th December 2014, Director Indranil Manna flagged off the car at 12:00 PM in the faculty building parking lot.",
      "The achievements of the BAJA team have boosted the spirit of the club. The FSAE (Formula SAE) Team is working very hard to prove their mettle in the FSAE Event later this year with the car currently in manufacturing phase.",

Asking for his resignation after exonerating him goes against the spirit of any judicial system.",
      "While it’s up to debate whether Rohan Bansal should have taken the high road and resigned to prevent any such exigent circumstance or whether Rohan Bansal was right in continuing as the CEO considering that he had previously successfully conducted the By-Elections; the question that remains unanswered is whether the intervention by authorities undermines to powers of the Students’ Senate and will such interventions be common in the future?",

      "Every institution is prone to problems. IIT Kanpur is no different – with such a large student population, maintaining an updatable database of almost any information is a tough task. Providing proper access to all of this information is also difficult. But there are a few people among us who have recognized such problems, treated them as challenges, and come up with logical and implementable solutions to aid the student community. These new initiatives will have a good role to play in making more and more information easily accessible to the junta and improving standards of student life in the campus.",
      "ShareIITK:",
      "The need for a central platform to find all academic material available with the students inspired the idea of ShareIITK. Share is an online portal where students can upload exam papers, quizzes, their solutions, e-books, notes and almost any other academic stuff for the whole campus community to access and enjoy the benefits of. In the words of Bhanu Pratap Singh Tanwar (one of the initiators), “accompanied by effective search and tagging, Share IITK is basically a step towards a customized exam preparation portal.”",
      "If you ever get stuck before an exam, and can’t find your assignment sheet, Share is the place to go. You shouldn’t be heading toward a photocopy shop or a friend likely to have it. That is the dream of the team behind Share.",
      "Share was conceptualized and implemented by Bhanu, Samarth and Romit. Contributions have come from students of different batches, pertaining to different courses. Still, this initiative requires support and widespread usage from the campus junta to make it the ideal place to go to, before exams. The full purpose of Share will be realized only when more people contribute stuff and suggest improvements.",
      "Link:http://share-iitk.herokuapp.com/",
      "Saner OARS",
      "This is the brainchild of Jayesh, and implemented by him and Srijan. As the name suggests, Saner OARS is an attempt to simplify OARS for the students. According to Jayesh, “OARS has many problems – design, user interface, uses outdated technology (ASP code + oracle DBMS), it can only run properly on Internet Explorer, and many more.” Saner OARS tries to fix some of these problems and make the user experience better.",
      "Right now, one can search for courses at Saner OARS, and find out the instructor, class hours and credits for each course. The founders hope to introduce many other features to the service, including, but not limited to, selecting choices, making sure they don’t clash, including course and instructor reviews, displaying the popularity of the course across different batches etc.",
      "Saner OARS is a very progressive attempt at improving old services of the institute, but it also requires inputs from interested students to make it even better. It is open source, so anyone with ideas can edit the source code and contribute to it. All source code is available atnavya.github.com– a group of all the open source developers at IITK.",
      "Link:navya.github.io/oars/",
      "Lost and Found",
      "The lost and found portal has been designed by Sohil Bansal. It is a very simple online implementation of a Lost and Found bulletin board, where all complaints of lost items and info about the items found can be posted, viewed and replied to. In the words of Sohil, “Whenever something is lost or is found, only two people are involved, so why bother everyone else? This dilutes the importance of significant messages.”",
      "The countless mails that were being sent to the student community by the DOSA (forwarded by others, of course) for lost items were a constant nuisance for everyone, and apparently this was the reason that prompted the creation of Lost and Found (LnF).",
      "The major problems faced by Sohil and others in taking this ingenious step were vastly the result of lack of cooperation by the administration. They contacted the relevant authorities, but were sent here and there without their problems being sorted. There are a large number of found items at the SIS office, but the officers are uninterested in uploading their details on the portal. Sohil feels that the users are taking advantage of the portal, but for it to fully serve its purpose, support from the administration is a must.",
      "Link:http://students.iitk.ac.in/lnf/",
      "Other efforts",
      "Apart from the above mentioned initiatives taken by the students, there have been various other efforts too, whose results are either in place, or are soon going to come.",
      "Hall Automation System was initiated by Sohil, and has the potential to automate almost all aspects of a student’s residential life. This includes mess bill, canteen bill, room status – all the details of each and every student stored at a single place for effective use. But, this system hasn’t been implemented since the last one year, due to lack of interest shown by the administration. The Hall offices are also lazy about providing the data.",
      "There’s also a website giving all the details regarding movie and match screenings at the OAT, which hasn’t been functional since the last couple of months. It was developed by Sohil. It is again an innovative way to avoid junk mails, and make things systematic at the same time. This concept can be scaled up to the whole Gymkhana’s activities, by possibly uploading all the upcoming events on a calendar.",
      "These are a few instances of individual attempts to solve daily problems in campus. Being members of this community, we should contribute to these initiatives and spread the word. We should also try and find solutions to many other problems in campus to improve the way we live, study and participate in activities. After all, a small step here is the beginning of being a responsible citizen to the nation.",
      "Support from the campus junta is the most important ingredient for the success of any of these works, so any conceptual, technical or content based help will be appreciated. According to Jayesh, such initiatives can be taken up by students as summer projects. A small chunk of time and effort from our lives can help us and the student community of IITK at large for years to come.",

      "The placement season is near, and lot of ‘coding’ companies are recruiting. Here is a primer on the different profiles the companies offer.",
      "First of all, let us make it clear thatcodingmerely means writing lines in a particular ‘language’ which follow a structure and are meant to be executed.CSE(Computer Science and Engineering) Jobs, are those in which the core of problem solving involves basic CS principles.  It is also different from a job likeCFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) Engineer,where even though the person would write significant amounts of code, the principles are derived from a different field.",
      "Most profiles tend to use the word “Developer” and “Engineer” interchangeably, and we would be using only Developer going forward except when there is a difference.",
      "This is more of a general term than most of which would follow.  A software developer is someone who works on a Software, or a Service and contributes code to it. This may involve adding new features, fixing bugs, or making the software work better. Many of the profiles given below can effectively be classified under Software Engineering, and are merely specializations. If this is the profile that has been mentioned, then it is better to talk to the company to figure out what the exact nature of the job would be.",
      "A web developer is a specialization of the above said Software Developer where the difference is that he would be working on Web Applications. This is often confused with Web Designers, who deal more with the look and feel of the webpage. A webpage is in general merely a HTML page with information, while a web application is a software that a user interacts with over the internet. This involves a lot of challenges of its own like reducing response times, load balancing etc. that may not be present in other areas. But also involves certain benefits like no need to consider installation platforms etc.",
      "Not so long ago, most operations of web application happened on the servers, and the browser was used just to show the results. Often the only people who worked on the front end were designers and a handful of front end engineers whose job was not that challenging. However this has currently changed a lot, as people have started writing full applications that reside on the browser and treat the server like a datastore, interacting with it just to get data. This has given rise to mainly 3 profiles:",
      "1. Backend Developer– The amount of job of a backend developer varies a lot, in many older applications, he was responsible for a lot of what the user finally viewed. However in modern times, a backend engineer works on serving data in particular formats to the frontend, and the rest is taken care of by the frontend code. Backend engineers have to write code, that computes the data as fast as possible and returns the data. The challenges lie in writing performant code, that can scale and handle a lot of users. The developer would also have to write code that processes the data in the back end, for later use.",
      "2. Frontend Developer– A front end developer is repsonsible for writing code that communicates with the backend and finally interacts with the user. The user would be interacting almost entirely with the frontend code which would be written in Javascript (or in certain cases a language that is then converted to Javascript). He would be dealing with the challenges of having multiple browsers, and non-unified JS specification, and would be working along with the UI Developer who would work on the look and feel of the application.",
      "3. In many web applications, and in most web applications that have only a few developers, the web application is divided into modules. A particular engineer might handle both the backend of that particular module, and are generally called web developers. Sometimes, they are also calledfull stack developers,although that is a much vertically integrated job.",
      "A computer system in this context is merely a combination of the hardware and software for a specific application. For a installed software, like a browser, this would entirely lie within your computer. But for most large applications, this would be spread across multiple servers :Webserversthat serve the web application,database serversthat store the data,storage serversto handle the storage of content,networkingto connect all these together, and otherspecialized serviceslike caching services, logging services, analytics services etc. A systems engineer would be responsible for architecting the whole structure. They would be responsible for the block level architecture of a computer service. As can be inferred from the description, this is a higher level job, and rather than coding involves more of architecting components such that they work together.",
      "SysOps or Systems Operation Engineer is someone who manages and monitors the system the software is running on. He makes sure that all the various parts that we covered above in systems engineering work as expected, and in general write code for the monitoring and maintenance of these systems. In general, he would be in charge of the operations of all the servers that the services run on, and the interconnects between them.",
      "Applications developer is a software developer who would in general be working on a user facing application, rather than things like database, and infrastructure. If it is in the web area, where most of the current work is in, it is same as that of a Web developer. The other important area for applications developer is developing Mobile Applications, which I would be explaining below. The third part of applications developer is writing software for  desktop computers. Microsoft would be the leading recruiter in this area.",
      "The major difference in this profile from an applications developer lies in the fact that the way people interact with mobile applications is very different from desktop software. A mobile application is often close to a web application from the perspective of a user. Hence this introduces challenges that both a Web Developer and a normal applications developer has to face, with other considerations like writing battery efficient code, and the limited screen area they have. The developers in this field have to exclusively work on Obective-C/Swift for iOS development, Java for Android development, or .NET platform for Windows Mobile development.",
      "A research engineer is generally an engineer in the research team, that would finally be responsible for implementing and testing out the research findings. They would work closely with the research scientist to either test the research work for practical considerations, or to implement a simple software, that would then be taken forward to the software team. They form a connect between the research teams and the software/hardware teams, and they generally do not conduct research but understand and implement it.",
      "A research scientist on the other hand would be researching in the areas the company is involved in, and in general this profile is reserved for Doctorates, and only in rare cases opens for Bachelors and Masters. However most research firms offer a form of gateway researcher position, where the person would be in a research team, with the expectation that once he gets a feel of it, would later go for a PhD.",
      "There is not much to tell about the exact work a researcher would be doing, since it varies a lot, however currently a significant percentage of the research recruitment is in area of Data Mining and Machine Learning.",

      "I would like to present not an article, but a story. Once upon a time, there was a team. It happened to be one of the most under-performing teams in the Inter-IITs. Exiting the league stages was a norm. The team could hardly score a goal in the tournament. And then sometime in 2004 came a visionary captain in Avik Bhandari, who along with Vadi sir converted this team into a family.  A culture of belongingness, discipline and integrity was ushered in and petty politics on the lines of seniority and halls of residence abolished. The result – 7 consecutive podium finishes between 2005 and 2011. It was this period that produced legends like Ronny, Kush, DOPA, Pappu, Anda, Murgi, Pulkit, Anurag (the list is non-exhaustive) and transformed Kanpur’s aquatics team into one of the most successful sporting units in the history of Inter-IITs.",
      "Fast-forward to 2014. Aquatics team had failed to secure a podium finish in the previous two editions. It was heart-breaking but the culture imbibed years back kept the team strong. Those two trophy-less seasons only brought the team closer and hungrier for success. And 2014 also happened to be a watershed year of sorts. A good portion of first-choice eleven would be playing their final Inter-IIT. And no stone was left unturned this time around. A radically new strategy was adopted and players were defragmented from specialized to fluidic roles. In other words, focus of each and every team member was not to go in as a 2ndattack or centre defence, rather just as a water-polo player. So now you know the mind-set with which our team left for 50thInter-IIT meet conducted by IIT Bombay.",
      "",
      "The first league match was against the home team. The swimming pool at IIT Bombay has a capacity to accommodate over 700 spectators and obviously, it was filled with IITB supporters. Undeterred by the cacophony of the home crowd, the visitors did what they knew best – smashing goals. And they did it in style. At the end of four quarters, an uneasy silence prevailed in the stands and the final score line read 7-2 in favour of the visiting team! Kanpur contingent ended Day 1 with silver in 400m freestyle (Parth Tripathi aka Genda), bronze in 50m breaststroke (Harshita Varshney) and another bronze in 4*100m freestyle (Genda, Kasauti, Vasu & Pikachu).",
      "Day 2 started on an equally positive note. In the morning slot, there was the water-polo match against Delhi. Our team resumed the goal scoring streak they had displayed against Bombay the previous evening and smashed 13 powerful goals. Delhi had no answer to such a violent attack and succumbed to a 1-13 defeat. With this win, Kanpur qualified for semi-finals irrespective to of result of the evening match against Kharagpur. Also, the 12 goal difference remained the highest in the tournament. This was followed by gold medal in 200m freestyle for our very own Genda. Next we faced Kharagpur in the evening match. Kharagpur had finished as second runner-ups in the last edition and according to expectations, displayed considerable improvement in the tournament. What followed was a tightly contested match. Though our team fought bravely, final result was 4-5 in their favour.",
      "Day 3 was a crucial day in our quest for gold. We faced the mighty Madras, champions of last edition in the semi-finals. Both sides weren’t looking to settle for nothing less than a win. Each team matched other team’s move; every goal was answered with a goal. There was little to differentiate the two teams and with just 2 minutes left on the clock scores were tied at 8-8. Kanpur held strongly to its fort and were just waiting for the Maddus to commit an error. And sure they did. In what proved to be mistake of the tournament, Madras team sent in a player who had been cap-rolled (equivalent to football’s red card) for the match. Immediately, a penalty was awarded to us. Parth, our most experienced and potent attacker made the most of this opportunity and converted the penalty in an intense-pressure situation. Defence did its job to perfection and match ended with a score line of 9-8. We were a win away from gold! But the day was not over yet. Kanpur’s torpedo, Parth was to compete in 50m freestyle and 200m individual medley. And the giant delivered with a bang! He not only bagged gold in 50m freestyle but also equalled the Inter-IIT record of 27.4 seconds (which incidentally, was set by our alumni Prateek Gupta aka Pappu.) To sweeten the day, he also added silver medal in the 200m individual medley.",
      "Fourth day dawns and we faced our old nemesis Kharagpur in the final. Match started on a very spirited note from both the ends. But in the first quarter itself, things got bloody. Pranjal Gupta aka Kasauti while defending against Aman Kharb was hit just above his right eye. He had to be rushed to the Health Centre. Undoubtedly the most stupendous defender of our team was out of the final. Things didn’t turn up well for Kanpur from then. Just before the last quarter, we were trailing 2-5 to Kharagpur. No one admitted at that time but many confessed later that moral was low. People had started losing hope and just then Mayura suggested to go in with double centre attack. With nothing to lose, we decided to play all out aggressive. Early in the final quarter and GOAL! The strategy was working and team started aiming for what others would have considered impossible. The team played out of their skin, fought for every inch and banged two more goals in their post. Kanpur had just pulled off mother of all comebacks! We were very much in contention and hearing this news, Kasauti fled the Health Centre to be there with the team. A penalty shoot-out was to decide the final outcome of the match. Match was on a cliff-hanger and it seemed like an eternity before the referee finally signalled the start of penalty shoot-out.",

      "Rishabh JainandAnushank Jain(Inquisitive Wanderers) interviewed Prof. Indranil Manna, Hon’ble Director of IIT Kanpur. The converstaion revolved around the state of Student Faculty Interaction at our campus!",
      "What is the status of Student Faculty interaction in the Campus ?",
      "Director– I personally believe that it should be very good. It has always been one of the major traditions of IIT kanpur to have a very strong student faculty interaction. I believe it should be good even now, but recently I encountered a group of students and it was real shock to me to hear that students find it difficult in some courses with some faculty members, they have very alarming experiences and they feel kind of threatened, inhibited or intidimated to approach the faculty for clarification and compared to that they even clarified that they used to feel at home with their teachers during their school days and that’s how they grew up and after coming here for whatever reasons they feel that teachers are not forthcoming or not very friendly to them. If that is the reality then I am really alarmed and thats a very shocking news to me and we must reverse this track .",
      "Should interaction be extended beyond academic walls ?",
      "Director–  See you must realize that today we are dealing with very large classes compared to 20 years ago. Now even I am teaching a class of about 100 students, I have taught for more than 25 years in another IIT, I never had in my discipline more than 25-30 students, so to keep track of every single student I always used to make a roll call so I could remember their first names. That’s no longer possible, so interaction has to go beyond the class and this is how you create bonds and I have many many fond memories of my earlier days when students, beyond classroom, they kind of approached, and thats how we thought of, and created an All India Student Congress which still continues in IIT KGP which was started in 1992-93 and it’s a student congress with undergraduate students. So I have always enjoyed interacting with students beyond classroom also because of my background of affection for physical activities, games and sports. I think it should be true here and it was true when I was a student here at PG level. I remember I wrote almost the entire thesis sitting in the drawing room of my guide, because there was a reason I had completed my entire masters thesis in just 3 days working day and night. We used to go and visit our teachers during Durga Pooja and Diwali and all those occasions. Those are very fond meories and this still continues and I hope this should continue. In other institutes wherever I have served this is a very common tradition. Yes, classroom is a formal atmosphere but interaction must go beyond the classroom .",
      "How has interaction level changed with time ?",
      "Director– As I mentioned, class size has grown enormously which is one of the impediments against having a close interaction, but at the same time amenities are much better now, the facilities available are better and certain things have changed over the years. For example, the emphasis on practical work or practical sessions in my opinion has reduced which is a very detrimental thing. In engineering, we must learn from practical experiences, working with our own hands, running the equipments, machines, collecting data and analysing it and so on. So in a group, students should work and then carry out an experiment and then discuss mong themselves. I must say, even  project work beyond normal setup is a very healthy practice, one need not always wait untill the final semester or the final year. One can start working even at an earlier stage and that’s how you learn a subject better and create interest in the subject much better, so beyond classroom, beyond academic activities, in areas where one has particular apetite, this is how one should pursue. It could be anything, it could be writing, it could be organizing an event, it could be games and sports, it could be taking group of students to industrial visit or any kind of activity which allows more interaction.",
      "What is the status of Student Faculty ratio in the campus",
      "Director– Student to faculty ratio hasn’t really changed much, even though we have grown in terms of students we also have more and more number of faculty members. Infact I possibly would say that student to faculty ratio today is not really anything to be worried about. We need more teachers, not for teaching, but for interaction outside the academic curriculum for project work, for research, for organization of events, for career guidance and various kinds of constructive activities. But yes, we are actually looking for good number of new faculty members. Even beyond regular faculty members we are very keen to hire faculty from industries, from R&D laboratories even faculty from abroad. If someone wishes to come and spend a semester or even a few weeks teaching module, or even without formal teaching interact with a group of students at PG level, we will definitely welcome that, so we are very actively trying to hire faculty from industry and other spheres as well.",
      "How was your interaction with your Faculty when you were an Undergraduate ?",
      "Director–  Very close and very warm, I mean I remember Prof. KC Gupta coming on a Sunday and working with me to change the big rolls of the carpet. I carried out my Masters in precisely one year, 3 to 4 months at the most, so there was a huge rush and I had to do things very quickly. So that was the kind of interaction and he was already close to retirement, a very senior person. I sat in Professor’s house and wrote my thesis, and corrected it. Those were the days when we did not have word processors, basically you write and then correct, and then again. Not only teachers, even laboratory staff were like very close mentors and I learned a lot of things from them. I must also mention that IIT Kanpur in those days had one of the finest labs and facilities in Materials Research. Of course, we still have very good ones, but I must say, at that time probably we were probably the best institution in terms of research facilities in Materials Department .",
      "What is the importance of healthy Student Faculty interaction ?",
      "Director –Basically we must realize one thing that the faculty member exists because of the students and not the the other way round. Teachers are here because the students come here. And learning is a continuous process, I always keep maintaining that it never suddenly starts and suddenly ends. You learn till your last breath, and its a continuous process. And the same thing is true about one’s career and its a long walk and you have many milestones. You learn at every stage, and remember learning is not necessarily by the students alone, teachers while teaching also learn a lot and that’s why these close interactions are absolutely essential. I personally would always urge the students a few things. First of all  I would quote the famous Sanskrit saying, “Shraddhawan lavte kendram” – You have to have a healthy respect. If someone is teaching you, it is purely because of certain circumstances that someone was born earlier than you, studied the courses, and has got experiences before you. So there’s no necessity that the teacher has to be always mentally or intellectually far superior than you. A student can be IQ-wise much superior than the teacher but it is the discipline which is created through this mutual respect which allows the pupil to learn from the teacher. And that has been the tradition of this country and we must maintain that. On the other hand, the teachers have always treated their students as their own children. So that kind of a healthy mutual respect develops. But another very important thing is that whatever your are doing, you must do it to perfection. You may have many many things in front of you, but you have to apply your judgement and be selective and prioritize. So if you are a student, you must consider learning as your first priority and rest of the things should fall. Learning is not necessarily sitting in a classroom, learning occurs in whatever you are doing. The other part is when a teacher is teaching, he should teach to the best of his ability and by teaching I don’t mean only teaching the textbook because for that there are many modules available. But teaching has to be supplemented with new knowledge which comes through research. So for that, this interaction is very important. We all have certain duties to perform in the society and we must not stay away from that. So we must first fulfill our primary duty and rest of the things should follow. I would also urge all my young friends in the campus that they must undertake a decent amount of physical activity and should not be confined only within a room and be hooked to a computer or laptop. You must indulge in sporting activities so that your physical agility comes to a required level and the level of your skill and various other things and you basically grow your muscles and your tissues. And beyond a certain age they don’t grow, so at this age I would say a healthy diet and healthy physical activity both are important.",
      "Special Note to the Campus Community",
      "I did (that) already, and in fact ever since I joined, I don’t know if you are aware, I met and pressed research scholars, PG students, UG students, Counselling Service, Volunteers; of course I met all the set of faculty members and I would like to repeat that, I got very valuable input and I try to implement some of them. No student should ever be able to say that I wanted to meet Prof. Manna and he did not give me time, so I am always available and always ready to meet them. But I can’t alone solve all the problems, so that’s why we have created certain bodies and we must remember that we have the Senate, the supreme academic authority of the institute, we have certain sets of rules, we have certain sets of traditions and so on. So we can’t deviate too far away from that but I think there is enough room for improvement and I personally think that IIT Kanpur Academic Senate should devote more time in understanding the academic needs of the students and how to address them rather than spending more time on rules and regulations, terminations, failures. And infact, I find it very strange that we repeatedly allow someone to get terminated and then he reappeals several times. Although I have often been told that our failure rate is very low but in my opinion there is no necessity that somebody has to fail. If we can have zero failure I think the country would prefer that kind of a system, without compromising the standards. Since you have flagged it off I certainly would take very serious note of it and would like to collect more information by direct interaction with the students and faculty members, may be the wardens and all. You possibly are aware that to make life more comfortable and homely, the institute administration has introduced a new layer called hall guardians. Essentially they are faculty spouses. We have just made a beginning, we picked only a few who would be spending very flexible hours in the hostels without any administrative responsibility, only to look after the students. You know our spouses anyway know how to raise children. That’s exactly what they are doing, so nobody can be better than them to take care of these young 18-19 year olds who arrive here away from their home. So Hall Guardians will take care of the hall amenities, safety, food quality, hygiene, many other issues, without having any administrative power though. So they are more like a motherly care for the students. We also have introduced a new layer called faculty advisors, faculty members who volunteered to remain attached to a batch who are joining this year for the next 3-4 years until they finish their course. We are talking only about the UG, not PG since they are supposed to be more mature. So the faculty advisors actually advice the students, in terms of what kind of courses to take, if one is not doing well what course he should take, what courses he should drop, how can one plan the future so that without losing a year or a semester, one can clear all the backlogs and get going. Faculty advisors give them advice and tips as to what kind of extra curriculars [sic] he should take or simply if you have any problem in terms of communication or having difficulty in a particular subject. Many of them do not know the rules properly or what kind of flexibility this IIT offers in terms of major, minor, dual degree and so on. We also have an office called ombudsperson who can actually take care of any kind of conflicts that may arise between UG students and a particular instructor. So we have introduced multiple layers of interaction who can act as mentors or guardians. The whole idea is to improve the faculty student interaction so that all of us can live in an ambience which will be more like a family and which we could retain in our memory and recollect fondly forever."

      "The third and final installment of the reminiscences of Abhay Bhushan, IIT Kanpur’s first graduate, is here! You can have a look at thefirstandsecondparts of this fascinating tale before moving on.",
      "",
      "",
      "At the start of our third year, the Kanpur Indo American Program (KIAP) had started with Prof. Norman Dahl from MIT and Robert Zimmerman from Ohio State University coming from the U.S. I specially remember Prof Zimmerman, as he had brought with him a Polaroid camera, and it was marvelous to see instant photography for the first time, pictures appearing right before our eyes just after they were taken. The system of education at IITK which was already rapidly changing in the second year got a bigger boost with the introduction of fresh ideas from the American faculty.",
      "Indian and American professors from some of the best universities in the U.S. including MIT, Princeton and UC Berkeley, came to IITK starting in 1962 with the start of Kanpur Indo-American Program (KIAP). These men inspired us with theircan-doenterprising spirit. We had many firsts, including the first digital computer, the first airfield, and many state of the art labs. I also remember a sign on Professor Charles Dryden’s desk,“When your grades are low and rewards are few, remember the big oak was once a nut like you.”These intellectual giants, both Indian and American, inspired us with their vision for the future, their passion for excellence, and their relentless action to make it all happen. These eminent men went on to change the face of education in India, and through example showed us the importance of working with our hands as well as our brains, and treating every one with dignity and respect, especially the poor and the illiterate people who did manual work. The Indo-US cooperation was so successful, that John Kenneth Galbraith, US Ambassador to India in the 1960’s remarked, “Of all the contributions of the United States to the Indian economic, social and cultural endeavour, the Indian Institute of Technology is perhaps the outstanding case.”",
      "Towards the end of our third year at IIT Kanpur, we moved to the new Campus in March of 1963. Not many buildings completed by this time. Only Hall I and Workshop were ready. So our first classes in the new Campus were held in the Workshop. After our summer vacations were over, when we came back in our 4th year, the lecture hall complex was completed, the Computer Center within this complex was being established, and new labs and facilities were coming up. There was also a basketball court, and Prof. Holt Ashley Aeronautics professor from MIT had brought several American basketballs with him. Holt, as Prof Ashley liked to be called was am imposing personality, about 6 feet 4 inches tall, but very warm and friendly. He gave us some basketball lessons and soon we had a team practicing and playing every day. We also played football (soccer), hockey, cricket, volleyball and tennis. During our Annual Sports Day, we had inter-year competition, and in December 1964, we went to our very first Inter-IIT sports meet at IIT Kharagpur.",
      "As we were now some distance from the City of Kanpur, it was not convenient to go to see a movie in the city of Kanpur, so we formed a film society, and brought films to be screened within the campus. We also invited guest artists and musicians, holding the event in the quadrangle of Hall 1. We also had our annual cultural day with plays and variety show, which was always a hit. As there were no girl students, the boys dressed up as girls for the plays, and they made quite a hit with the other students! The only girl around campus of high school age was Kavery Muthana, who happened to be the Deputy Director’s daughter, so practically off-limits for us. She later graduated from IIT Kapur.",
      "During our summer vacations, we would go for all-India tours to visit industry and for sightseeing. These tours, organized by departments, were quite educational and fun and led to all of us bonding together more. We also had NCC camps during our summer vacations, and these were fun too.",
      "The Student Gymkhana was also formed during the start of our fourth year, with the Deputy Director Dr. M. S. Muthana as its first President and Ram Jag Prasad, our class mate as its first Vice-President. At that time the President was a faculty member, and the Vice-President a student.",
      "Then came July of 1964, and we were in our final year. We started the student guide program with the final year students mentoring the first year students. There were more American professors, new equipment and new labs, and the computer center was flourishing. The airfield was also ready with Prof. Ashley’s guidance, and a gliding club was started with preference given to Aeronautical Engineering students.",
      "Soon it was spring of 1965 and it was time to graduate. Jobs were scarce and Brand IIT was not yet established. Very few of us had any job offers by the time we graduated. Eventually all of us found jobs or went for higher studies, mostly abroad to US and Canada. I was fortunate to have been accepted at M.I.T. and given a Research Assistantship. Our education at IITK had prepared us well for the challenges at M.I.T. and the semester at Bell Labs in 1966, working on the world’s first color picture phone for my masters’ thesis. In 1969 at M.I.T., the ARPAnet, the forerunner of the Internet was starting, and I was fortunate enough to get involved and connected M.I.T.’s Multics system to the Net (Node #4), designing and building the hardware myself. Being part of the very first Network Working Group with Vint Cerf, I chaired the File Transfer Protocol Working Group, and ended up authoring the FTP and early versions of the Email standards. What is important in life, which was reinforced at IITK, is to show up and take the initiative. Success is oftenbeing in the right place at the right time. However, one has toseize the opportunitiesboth visible and latent."

      "Having represented India for over 16 years in more than 300 international matches, Dhanraj Pillay is the name which is synonymous with Indian Hockey. He led India to the golden victories in the 1998 Asian Games and 2003 Asia Cup. Vox Populi and Insight360 got the opportunity to meet this living legend on the final day of Udghosh, the annual sports festival of IIT Kanpur, though briefly. He talked about various things including hockey, Incheon Asian Games and a couple of talismans for the youth. Here is the full interview, straight from the horse’s mouth.",
      "VP:Everyone who knows about Hockey in India knows you. After being synonymous with Hockey for all these years, what has been the most prized moment of your career?",
      "DP: I think the most memorable moment of my career was my debut, the day when my coach offered me the Indian jersey for the first time at the Allwyn Asia Cup, 1989. It was the first time when I got the feeling of accomplishment. Again, when I was playing in the SAF Games, 1995, Chennai, we were up against Pakistan in the finals. We defeated them by 5-2 and I scored 3 goals whereas Mukesh Kumar scored 2. I think this was the turning point of my career as people started to know me thereafter. Before this,Mohammed Shahid( my idol) andPargat Singhwere the only reknowned players. Indian Hockey players were declared national heroes. The whole team was felicitated by Jayalalitha, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. There was no turning back after this achievement.",
      "VP: India has made it to the semi-finals of the Asian Games at Incheon. The last time we won the Gold was under your captaincy in 1998. Can Indian Hockey team end its 16 year long draught of an Asian Games Gold this time?",
      "DP:I sincerely wish that all the previous records are broken by the current Hockey squad.  I will be elated to see the Hockey team winning the Gold under the leadership ofSardara Singh. But I must admit that the level of Hockey has gone down in recent years and a prime reason for it is the foreign coaches. It is a general belief that foreign coaches are the best but in my opinion Indian coaches are equally good. Looking back at the performance of the Indian Hockey team, you can easily witness a constant decline in the last decade. We lost two finals in the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Delhi Commonwealth Games, we lost to Australia by 8 goals. In the recent Commonwealth Games at Glasgow, we were again defeated by Australia, 4-0,  in the finals. It hurts me when we face such huge debacles.",
      "VP: How has been your experience at Udghosh?",
      "DP:Udghosh’14 has done a remarkable job, both the student and faculties. The infrastructure of IIT Kanpur is one of the best in the nation. The stay facilities are excellent. I would also like to mention  Mr. Santosh Upadhyay and Mr. Abhishek Pandey. Mr. Santosh has been with me for the last 10-12 years and has had a great influence on sports. If you want to know any player in Kanpur, one should go to him as he knows all of them. Abhishek Pandey has been a fellow international athlete.",
      "VP: A talisman for all budding sportspersons and others out there.",
      "DP:Whatever you do, do it with passion and hard-work and you will never fail in life. Success is directly proportional to the amount of hard-work you put in. My mother has been an instrumental figure behind this philosophy. I usually say: Do it with all your heart, whatever the task is! Let me put it this way, I had never thought to represent India one day. My brother, who had played some matches for the national side, inspired me to work hard. He told me that it is very easy to break into the team but sustenance is very difficult. For example, getting into IIT Kanpur is easier than sustaining oneself for four years. I think that it is my brother whose inspiration culminated in the hard work and subsequently my position in the team. So, to be precise, do what you like. If you do not like something, do not do it.",
      "(With this we put an end to the question spree and asked him for a photograph. Even after a two hour long felicitation function, Dhanraj Pillay happily agreed for the snaps and also went on to chat with the enthusiasts outside his room for a considerable amount of time.)",

Sensing my nervousness, he asks me to put down my bag and sit back comfortably. By this time my nervousness has diffused to a great extent. I take a look around his office room. Decorated tastefully, his room is minimalistic yet aesthetically appealing. Averse to any kind of publicity, he says he believes only in work. He takes a look at my Questionnaire and finds the questions interesting. Then he lets me take a look at some of his sketches. I am left spellbound. There is one particular sketch of Amitabh Bachchan, which is still lingering in my mind. I tell him I am into sketching and show him the only sketch I had with me. He is very impressed. Having further gained confidence, I set off to a great start.)",
      "Excerpts from my tête-à-tête with him.",
      "I like academics, I like problem solving. I do not like bosses, which does not at all mean bosses are bad.  Just that for me, working in a private/public firm was ruled out. I didn’t really know what to pursue as a career option till my final year. My father is a researcher, my mother is a teacher. Those aspects were in my mind! It was Professor Vinay Kripal, a faculty member with the HSS department at IIT B with whom I was taking a course on Communication Skills in my final year, who, I believe, changed my course of life! She listened to me very patiently and suggested I did a SWOT (Strength Weakness Opportunity threats) analysis. Putting it simply, I listed down the bunch of traits (my likings – things that make me happy) on the left column and a bunch of job options on the right.  Then, I didmatch making—faculty positionemerged as a top option which I could relate to very well. I was so impressed with Professors who taught me then – Profs. Seshu, Maiti, Chinchalkar, Gaitonde, Amarnath and many others. I wanted to be free, to be my own boss. I wanted to pursue what I liked, what my interests were (and are). I wanted to be free yet be totally accountable to myself!",
      "2.20 years hence, I am sure you must be proud of your decision.",
      "Has it been 20 years! No kidding (laughs). I still feel I am a student. Well, actually I am a student, because I am still learning. I will always keep learning, I guess. 20 years down the line, not a bad choice, not a bad choice at all. I do whatever I had envisaged 20 years ago.",
      "3.How does it feel to be closely in contact with the next generation?",
      "Fantastic!Fantabulous! – ‘Fun’tabulous!  They say it’s generation gap, but I don’t know, I can relate very well with students. I reckon, and my colleagues will probably agree with me, that professors stay young because they get a chance to interact with a lot of young minds, over and over again!",
      "4.Any particular incident that has stood out in all these years of association with IITK.",
      "There are many. I would rather talk about only positive instances —  I am super proud that IIT Kanpur has won the General Championship this year for the first time. I am a B. Tech from IIT Bombay. During my time there, we weresports crazypeople. Here in IITK, we have a lot of faculty colleagues who are into serious (competitive) sports – in cricket, badminton, table tennis, basket ball, volley ball, squash and many others. All of us actually wanted the IIT Kanpur student contingent to win the General Championship, as much as the students wanted themselves. This has been our(faculty, students and coaches inclusive) collective dream! Most of us sweated for many years and thanks to the hard work and good wishes of all thatwe finally have the General ChampionshipTrophy– one of the many highlights of my stay over here. I feel tremendously happy about it. The challenge is now to retain it! A hidden lesson, at least for me – Sports teaches usto not give up– I like the message Rocky Balboa gives –it is not about winning but the ability to stand up every time one is down. And of course, one has to winright!",
      "5. You have been on both sides of the table, as a student and as a professor. How does it feel?",
      "I wish the table wasn’t there. I still feel I am a student and learning. Ya so the table, the way I see it, isn’t there at all.",
      "6. How do you feel the IIT system has changed over the years?",
      "Quite a difficult question for me to answer! I feel (my colleagues may agree or disagree) that the IIT system was for long quite focussed on teaching as it was perhaps expected to be. The academic curricula developed over the years have led the entire system to offer afantasticundergraduate programme we are all proud of. Our postgraduate programmes are now equally good and at par with many leading universities worldwide. The efficacy of our training is exemplified by the alumni from different IITs doing so well worldwide. And that is something as a faculty member of the IIT system, and IIT Kanpur in particular, I am very proud of. I only wish the quality of our training/teaching is not compromised. You know,OLD is GOLD. Of course research is very important, and so are many other activities. The overall development of our students is also essential and that is something we focus on implicitly. There are plethora of opportunities in fields other than academics (e.g., Arts, Sports, Adventures, Dance, Music) we provide that students can pursue outside their regular classes. Students have complete freedom to pick (m)any activity(ies). I know many of my colleagues, who themselves are IIT alumni, have become fantastic musicians. I remember my conversation with Somesh Mishra (a flutist) a few months ago. He goes likeSir, what I realize now is how we actually got trained. We thought we were learning only the material provided to us through the courses. Years down the line,I realised something. If I want to learn anything new now, I can do so much faster and with so much ease. That’s the actual training the IIT System provides.Well, I was in complete agreementwith him. I can still sense this attribute of the IIT system to be present. The system now is in transition – and a lot is expected from it. You know, there is this concept ofinner beautyandouter beauty. It is the inner self (already so beautiful) in the system we need to focus on, because if we do that the outer self will automatically be beautiful. We should not make compromises and should not let go of the good things that have served us so well over many years.",
      "7. You must have been an all rounder in your college days at IITB. What were the various activities you were involved in?",
      "Well, I used to play table tennis, cricket and soccer. I still remember getting injured when I was playing barefoot in my hostel’s quad and my left foot got pierced through by a piece of glass. I used to sing, I had sung forSurbahaarfor a couple of years. In my final year I had participated in Mood Indigo – I did a bit of Arts as well.(I ask him about his painting ‘The Corridor, 1995’, he shows it to me and explains it enthusiastically. It is a single point perspective of a corridor, 4 people sitting in the corridor, he could be spotted among them. Medium used is spray water-color. I almost took it for a photograph.)",
      "8.You had also quipped once that you have been associated with nearly all IITs. Could you elaborate on that.",
      "Absolutely! My father did his Phd from IIT Kharagpur. I did my B.Tech from IIT Bombay. My former Phd advisor, and my mentor for life, Prof. G. K. Ananthasuresh, he is a B.Tech from IIT Madras. And I am teaching at IIT Kanpur. If my 12 year old goes to IIT Delhi, the affiliation (with older IITs) will be complete. Naah! there are many new IITs now in place, I am very positive that around that time,  they will come at par, and hopefully the overall IIT system will make our country proud.",
      "9.Age does not seem to have caught up with you. You still have that childlike enthusiasm and vitality. What keeps you motivated?",
      "Perhaps my profession because I like to interact with my students. As I said before, one advantage of being a faculty member is to always stay in touch with young minds. And of course in my personal opinion, it’s a nice idea for one to have that child within. You need to play every now and then – you need to have fun. And why not? You should always have fun. You should not pretend to be an adult everytime. You should unleash that childlike aura as often as possible, if not always, and enjoy to the fullest without really worrying about what others think. Prof. R. Balasubramanium, a great friend and colleague, a multi-faceted personality, a fantastic human being and my personal role model, was miles ahead. We have played together on the field and stage so many times.",
      "10 . You are actively involved in a lot of things, academic and non-academic. How do you find time for your passions?",
      "I don’t worry about time at all. Frankly speaking, I don’t plan anything; I just do it, impulsively. If your heart tells you to pursue something, just go ahead and pursue. That’s what I believe in and try to practice. I fail so many times but I still keep trying.",
      "11. You have a rather peculiar habit of not carrying a cellphone around. A lot of people are curious to know the reason.",
      "Unfortunately that is not true anymore. I am now affiliated with the Office of International Relations and I have to carry a cellphone. You know it’s very funny, the way I feel. These gadgets, this technology has been invented to facilitate communication. But what’s happening (and I am not sure if this is only my observation or of others as well) is that people are not communicatingface to facethese days. Looks like this has become a thing of the past! People are now shying away from communicating conventionally, rather they are getting addicted (possibly heavily) to these gadgets. They don’t find the need to come together and have, say, abullasession orCaksession, what we used to have in IIT Bombay. We had a group of 13 members, wingmates, of different backgrounds, of all batches and even PG students. Often I used to find myself in a common room, a very large room at the end of our wing which could accommodate all 13 people in there. We used toCak awayon all topics under the skytill 2 o’clock or 3 o’clock in the morning. That thing seems missing, or I could be wrong. If I am not, you know, having these gadgets is fine so long as one does not let go of the conventional modes of communication.",
      "12.You never felt the need to carry a cellphone?",
      "No, absolutely  not! I can already sense some sort of dependence in the question. But I have a different, rather personal reason. If I start using something, I become totally addicted to that, so I try to refrain from using such gadgets. I know I am totally addicted to emails, and to something else you folks know well(Of course we do!).",
      "13.Word is around that you had earned the nickname ‘Bond’ at IITB. How did it come about?",
      "It’s not how it seems. Back then, we used to have a senior Hemal Naik, he was in Chemical engineering, and was in my anti wing. In my first or second year, I don’t remember quite well, every morning when I used to walk along the corridor of my wing, I often used to spot him. He used to see me walk towards him, and used to go like, “My name is Bond”, followed by a very long pause, and then “Black Bond”. Well, thanks to my complexion! That’s how it started but sooner or later ‘Black’ faded away and what remained was ‘Bond’. It’s definitely not related to the 007. By the way, we have another colleague bearing the nick name Bond, a graduate from IIT KGP.",
      "14.Words you live by.",
      "Contentment(Anyone who has done the TA101 course under him last semester will be able to relate to it).That is the most important word everybody lives by. Everybody wants to be happy, everybody wants to be content. Some think they would get it by making a lot of money, some want to be celebrities, some want to make a difference, some go for social work etc. etc. Whatever it is, everybody wants to be satisfied and happy every moment.",
      "15. Any final message for the student community.",
      "I will share one thing that one of your seniors, Manish Dwivedi, told me way back in 2002-2003 or around that time:Whatever one does, one should do it well –irrespective of whether it is academics, sports, or any interest or any hobby one wants to pursue. That makes a lot of sense because if one is not putting her/his own best, it’s a waste of time and effort. If one puts in 100% in the task one is engaged in, either by choice or (hopefully not) by force, he/she should do it as best as possible to extract maximum possible satisfaction. I still keep this mental note to myself;Whatever you do, do it well(give your 100%), otherwise there is no point.",
      "(With this he signs off but not before getting into a philosophical mood. He shares with me his insights on life in general and tells me about an article he has written which delves into the deepest recesses of his mind. After this profound discussion, I leave, absolutely mesmerised.)",

      "Continuing with the reminiscences of Abhay Bhushan, here comes the second part in the trilogy. Enjoy! (You can view the first parthere.)",
      "",
      "Life at Textile hostel was fun for the most part. There were badminton courts in the little courtyard and a playing field behind the hostel. I used to play most evenings, and also did some friendly wrestling with friends. Sometimes we would walk to the River Ganges which was not too far away and take a bath or a swim. There was also a common room where we had a table tennis table and carom and chess. There was a small dining hall. A contractor was hired to provide the food, which was generally of poor quality. Unfortunately, there was child labor in those days, and some of the mess servants were under 14 years of age. They were generally abused by the older adult mess servants. For entertainment, we went to Green Park, whenever there was a cricket test match in town, and also saw movies as we were in the City of Kanpur. When we could afford it, we went to the restaurant Khayyam. In the very first year we also had a very nice all day picnic in Allen Forest behind HBTI campus, which was most enjoyable.",
      "Every year, we had an annual sports day, with all types of games and races. We also put our own cultural program annually, with plays in Hindi and English and music, songs and skits. We also had debating competitions. Prof J. P. Bhargava, our drawing teacher, was in charge of sports, and encouraged us to play games, ensuring that we had the necessary equipment and supplies. Later on, he also became in charge of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) program, which became compulsory after the 1962 India China border war.",
      "Prof. E. K. Das, our English teacher took a lot of interest in the cultural activities and directed a number of English plays. He tried to encourage us to read English classics, and also public speaking. English was our first humanities subject.",
      "In our second year, Prof G. D. Agarwal joined the faculty in Civil Engineering and became our hostel warden. For those who know GD, he was very dedicated to us students and to mother India. You may recall that he recently declared a fast to help protect River Bhagirathi, the source of the Ganga. Now GD was an early riser and declared compulsory morning exercises (P.T.) at 6 a.m. for all of us. He would arrive at day break at the hostel, blow his whistle and exhort us all to become physically active and strong. He took attendance and was disappointed that many students would not show up. As a punishment for our tardy attendance, GD had us all march to Kalyanpur to help symbolically lay the foundation for the new IITK campus. GD was also fun and took us all on a memorable trip to Khajuraho.",
      "In our second year, Prof. N. C. Nigam also joined the faculty in Civil Engineering. His brother Prof. P. C. Nigam was already a Chemistry teacher. NC was quite friendly to the students and played tennis with us on the HBTI campus courts. It was fun to get together with teacher’s informally. Another teacher who joined us in second year was Prof. A. S. Parasnis who taught us material science. At that time England-returned Prof. Parasnis was quite fashionable and meticulous, bordering on being snobbish. He was a good teacher who was erudite and communicated well. Years later, I found Prof. Arvind Parasnis to be extremely warm, full of human qualities, quite different from my initial perceptions. Prof. K. R. Sarma also joined the faculty in second year and taught us Electrotechnique. He was the first professor at IIT Kanpur that I came across who made up new types of problems for Quiz’s and Tests himself, that were not found in the books. This certainly put emphasis on fundamentals and original thinking.",
      "There were several tragic incidents that made a deep impression on me. In our second year, we had the first student suicide at IITK, when our classmate V.K. Agarwal took his own life by ingesting rat poison. As we were fewer than 70 students in the hostel, two to a room, we were a close-knit group. None of us had any inkling that something may be amiss. Not even VK’s roommate suspected that anything was wrong. On going through VK’s belonging, we discovered some letters that seem to suggest that being rejected in love could have been a reason. It was definitely not academic pressure or performance. I do vividly remember the funeral procession from the Textile hostel to the Shamshan Ghat on the banks of the Ganges.",
      "There were two shameful incidents at the hostel that instilled in me a deep commitment to protecting civil liberties and human rights. The first involved our hostel Chowkidar Raghunath, a very nice congenial fellow. One day, one of the students found a pen with Raghunath that the student claimed was his. Raghunath explained that he had found it on the ground and picked it up and put in his pocket. The student accused Raghunath of stealing. Then another student, who had recently lost a watch started accusing Raghunath of stealing his watch. Then began a third degree interrogation of Raghunath, followed by manhandling and beating by some cowardly students, joined by the bigger boys from the Textile Institute. Thus began a Calcutta style mob justice and Raghunath was beaten mercilessly. Fortunately, some of us had the courage to speak up, so this beating was stopped but not before some of Raghunath’s bones were broken, and he was bleeding profusely. Several months later, I saw Raghunath driving a Rickshaw with slightly deformed arm, as a result of broken bone not having been set right.",
      "The second incident involved a mess boy who was scarcely 14 or 15 years old. One of my class mates, who had gone to visit a friend at a hospital claimed that he saw this boy steal his bicycle from a distance of about 100 yards. Soon the student and some of his friends started the third degree interrogation of the poor mess boy, and some of them started burning the soles of the mess boy’s feet to get him to confess and tell them where the lost or stolen bicycle was. Some of us again got wind of this happening, and quickly intervened to rescue the boy but not before there were severe burns to his feet. While I am aware that the Indian Police still practices these brutal torture methods, I had certainly expected better from my classmates. I recall these incidents with a profound sense of shame, and they strengthened my resolve to protect human rights everywhere.",
      "When our second year started, we had a choice of whether to do ragging of the freshmen or not. We had two distinct camps, one that favored ragging, and the other that opposed it. Both camps were quite adamant in their position. Some of us were on the fence, and did not care strongly one way or the other. The general consensus was that the “ragging” or “introductions” should be humane and more fun, and not degrading or threatening. The 1961 batch of almost 100 students was housed in several rented houses in city of Kanpur and the Leather Institute hostel, so it was difficult for the anti-ragging crowd led by fellow student Nahar Singh to monitor and control the pro-ragging guys. I am sure that much of the ragging introductions got out of hand and the two camps also came to blows with each other.",

      "Starting with this post, Vox Populi aims to bring forth vignettes of beauty from the rich and vastly unexplored repertoire of IIT Kanpur’s history. An institute like IIT Kanpur, which holds a special place in the history of education in India, is bound to find a lot to cherish and a lot to overlook at even a cursory glance back. A slightly more scrutinizing look would reveal the familiar and the unfamiliar, the mundane and the extraordinary, the glory and the murky. As the conscience of the campus, we feel it is of vital importance to know about the legacy bequeathed upon us. And what better way to introduce the institute and the history than reminiscences from the first student of IIT Kanpur, the inimitableAbhay Bhushan. His article will be published in three parts, the first of which is given below:",
      "",
      "",
      "My journey through IIT Kanpur began towards the end of July 1960, when I landed at Kanpur Central with a fewNaya Paisasin my pocket. Yes, there were Naya Paisas then, worth only 0.64 of the old Paisa, a result of conversion to the metric system. To me these Naya Paisas came to symbolize not a loss in value, but the new currency of innovation and entrepreneurship, and a pioneering spirit that welcomed progress.",
      "There was a little blue truck waiting at the train station with the legendary Shishupal, waiting for scores of dreamy-eyed boys who arrived from all parts of the country (there were no girls, not even one among the hundred who started). The truck took us to Government Central Textile Institute (GCTI) Hostel in Gwaltoli, where we stayed for almost three years, until our move to Hall 1 in March 1963. Shishupal, and the little blue truck, took all of us back and forth every working day, to Harcourt Butler Technological Institute (HBTI) campus, a few miles away, where we had our lecture halls and labs. After about a year, the Institute got a bus, and our bus driver was none other than Shishupal.",
      "I have called Shishupal legendary, as he was perhaps the most colorful character at the Institute for forty years, until his death in 2000. He was immensely popular with the students, spoke a dozen languages, told great story stories, and was a man of many talents. He had a passion for theatre and mime, and was our stage prop manager and make-up man for almost all of our early plays. I remember at one time, just for fun he applied make-up on me and a couple of friends, to look like a Sadhu (Indian mendicant). I still have a photograph from that time with me. He was an intriguing personality, and the stories he told about his life were incredible and unbelievable. He used to tell us that earlier he had been with the Bombay Film Industry where he learned the art of make-up and theater. Later, when World War II started, he joined Subhash Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army, was trained in espionage and enlisted in the British Army as an undercover agent. He was awarded a medal by the British but soon disappeared as he feared he was being caught as a spy. He spent time in the Far East, and after India’s independence Shishupal drifted from one job to another, until he found his true home with generations of students at IIT Kanpur. In the premier issue ofVoices, the IIT KanpurAlumni magazine, there was a memorable article on Shishupal, and carried a poem by Gayatri Natu,",
      "The Jester comes forth as a Jack",
      "A King, an Ace, the rest of the pack",
      "I could’ve found out",
      "What he’s all about",
      "But I really haven’t quite got his knack",
      "During our first year, we were the only class at the Institute. However, we did not escape ragging or hazing, as we were ragged by the Textile Institute seniors, who were not too happy with these brash IITians usurping their brand new Hostel. I have vivid memories of these ragging sessions, when a bunch of us on successive days, were woken up late at night and marched in front of a large group of Textile Institute seniors, who tried to intimidate us, by shouting at us and threatening to strip us and mete out other punishments if we did not obey them. I was a little scared but also somewhat amused, as they were holding court, with King Lingam, presiding. We were all asked to hail King Lingam by shouting, “L*** Maharaj ki Jai”. After that we were called one by one, and made to a special salutation, requiring us to be in a prone position, and raising our right hand in a salute. Then people were asked to sing a song, do some vulgar displays of AC-DC, and repeat some foul swear words pertaining to mothers and sisters. They often threatened to put Elgin Mill’s chimney up ours. I distinctly remember that a friend of mine was asked to hold his private parts and sing the old Hindi song, “Nanhe munhe bacche teri mutthi me kya hai? Mutthi me hai taqdir hamari” (Little children what is in your hands? In Our hands is our Destiny). I still get a few chuckles when I think of those ragging scenes.",
      "On the first day our classes started, Dr. P. K. Kelkar, the first Director of IITK, welcomed us at the newly constructed wing of HBTI. He assured us thata journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a great building starts with a mound of dirt.In 1961, we actually walked from Kanpur to the new campus at Kalyanpur, a distance of about 8 miles, giving a hand in digging the foundation for the Institute, and contributing that proverbial small mound of dirt. Dr. Kelkar symbolized the spirit of innovation and quest that has been a hallmark of IITK from its humble beginnings at HBTI and the Textile Hostel, to the beautiful campus we have today. Through my early experience at IIT Kanpur, I learnt that we don’t have to own buildings and equipment, or even have paid employees, in order to succeed. When we do something useful and worthwhile, these come later. Consider all the great enterprises that started in a garage or borrowed facilities with borrowed equipment, and people putting in sweat equity. And these include Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Apple Computer, Cisco, Google, Infosys, and many others.",
      "Dr. P. K. Kelkar, the first Director of IIT Kanpur, was a most remarkable man. He had all the characteristics of a great leader – imagination, boldness, resourcefulness, perseverance, integrity and humility. He was always prepared to meet any of us students at a moment’s notice, which was most unusual in India, especially in those days. When we had problems, he asked for our patience, and encouraged us to do our best, even in trying circumstances.",
      "I remember that in the first year of IIT Kanpur, we had many professors borrowed from the archaic U.P. educational system. These professors believed in memory and rote, even for math problems. We had books by S. L. Loney (or Looney it might be, as I thought of Looney Tunes), and solved examples by S. L. Loney for our text book. In our final exam for the first year, we had some of these problems from the solved examples text books, to do. As memorizing the solutions verbatim to math problems was anathema to me, and I refused to do it by memory and solved the problems by applying principles. Naturally, this took time and I was only able to solve four of the six problems. Considering myself to be quite fast in math, I wrote in my answer book, that I challenged anyone to solve the problems in time allotted,. This comment of mine bothered the professor who called me to his office and chided me for writing rubbish in my answer book, and added that many of my classmates completed the problems in time, just fine. I asked him to show me one of the answer books, and I pointed it out to him that these were memorized answers, verbatim from the book, including statements such as “from here we can get the answer as on page 87.” I pointed to him that doing math by memorizing solutions without understanding or doing the steps was completely ridiculous. This incensed the professor, who told me that for being impertinent, he could get me expelled from the Institute! I walked out of his office angry, saying that truth is on my side and not even his father could get me expelled. I went straight to the Director’s office, and explained the whole situation to Dr. Kelkar. Dr. Kelkar listened very patiently, and then calmly told me, “Abhay, don’t mind this too much. Take heart, the Institute is hiring new faculty, and the second year will be very different. IIT Kanpur will be the best Institute in India with the most progressive education system.”",
      "Dr. Kelkar’s words were indeed prophetic! In our second year in 1961, we had excellent new faculty. Dr. Kelkar had been able to attract some of the best young minds to come and join IIT Kanpur. Many of these teachers had obtained their doctorates in the United States, Canada and UK, and had experience of teaching there. Further, Dr. Kelkar gave full freedom to the faculty to discuss and decide the academic directions. The new professors gave emphasized original thinking and application of principles over memory and rote. What a refreshing change for me! In one of the first tests, I solved the test paper in less than half the time, while most of my classmates were still sitting there when time was up. They came out and complained how these problems were so difficult. Upon asking what the difficulty was, they replied that they had not seen the problem before in “solutions book”. As a result of these progressive changes I went from the bottom half of my class to the top five percentile!",

      "5 am, 16th July 2014",
      "I set my feet on Kanpur Central Railway Station with verve and panache. Two more turns of the minute hand – I cross the KIAP era halls and set my eyes on the imperious Hall 10. I’m introduced to an amiable fellow, my ‘bapu’ ‘Aditya Jain’ who I later realized is an ordinary person with extraordinary sensibilities. C416 it is and I march forward and upwards onto the third floor.",
      "Towers of my expectations started crumbling in the heat and humidity of a room infinitesimally larger than a coffin for two people. A sense of foreboding developed, a sense that was vindicated by events that have followed. That night I was drilled on customary observances. That night I developed a factitious hall identity,and a tolerance for peculiarly ornate and metaphorical language. That night, I realized that the first ‘I’ in ‘IIT’ means ‘Indian’, that I was momentarily not proud to be. I had no one to talk to, so I slept after half an hour of existential self introspection.",
      "The orientation started officially. The addresses by the professors, especially the DOAA were the most prudent words to be heard over the next 10 days. They were in the most literal sense, the real golden rules, to be adopted in thought and action. A few things he said, left me disconcerted: people in the highest echelons knew what was happening and statements being made were nothing more than a legal boilerplate, but …… more on that later. The orientation program progressed seamlessly. The articulate planning by the Counselling Service implicitly revealed their hours of hard work. The concern of the Assistant Coordinators I talked to and of others by extension is indescribable in words, but our agony in its absence is. Our lives would have been exquisitely miserable if it were not for these people. I would like to categorically thank Gaurav Doshi, Shubham Karnawat, Prasham Jain and Ankit Goyal for being so considerate.",
      "I had my first encounter with blatant sexism on the very first day, and it only increased in orders of magnitude in days to come. I could not but notice the transition from innocuous ‘meant to open up’, double entendres to the unabashed invocations of salacious symbolism, unmistakably intended to demean and vilify the fairer sex. The latter is not justifiable on any grounds. To be fair, the counselling service did organise an excellent session ‘Cognizance’, with the aim of inculcating gender sensitivity.",
      "To break a [senior (your age + 1 or 2)/junior] “interaction” barrier one needs to go through some rites of passage.",
      "They can be anything from enacting a pornographic act in all audio and graphic detail or invoking a female family member and describing an act about the center of gravity of her body. On doing so, seniors apparently reveal the much touted maxims which form the cornerstone of senior-junior interactions. The most thoughtful ones are listed for reference:",
      "Not using expletives is unbecoming of a man.",
      "Not watching porn is unbecoming of a man.",
      "Not stimulating genitals is unbecoming of a man.",
      "Studying is an anathema.",
      "Sleeping on time is an anathema.",
      "Waking up on time is an anathema.",
      "Prof’s are stupid. People talking to profs are stupid.",
      "“We will confiscate any laptops if found but we will provide you the choicest of stuff even if you don’t ask for it”(Read between the lines).",
      "There are many more ‘sutras’ of becoming ‘bakait’, but all are essentially freudian frustrations vented in the facade of cultivating creative genius.",
      "When one is trapped in this blitzkrieg of insanity, it is our own task to find advice for making rational choices. In the last session with Profs, Suchitra Ma’am repeatedly emphasized one thing: “Do not ignore the profs”. I was listening and it has paid me back. There are some really intelligent and helpful seniors, people you can look up to for advice on all matters, but one has to find such people. In my case it is a certain ShCh. There are many good people, but what sets him apart from the rest is his unassuming disposition and childlike curiosity towards life in general. So, yes, there is hope, maybe as evanescent as the morning dew, but it is there!",

      "We went to this village, to know more about their basic lifestyle, needs and problems. Over several visits and multiple conversations with local people, we were intrigued by the condition of basic infrastructure facilities; facilities we so often take for granted. And all within the vicinity of our beautiful campus.",
      "We realized that apart from running Shiksha Sopan(which aims to uplift underdeveloped sections of the society through meaningful education), we haven’t done anything significant for our neighboring communities. Quoting the ex- Union Rural Development Minister, Mr.Jairam Ramesh: “I am sure that IIT Kanpur has done more for the US than for Kanpur city”. Certainly makes sense.",

      "These are some of the mails sent by the Dean of Student Affairs (DOSA) of IIT- Kanpur to all students’ list in the past month. These days the “lost and found” mails are qualified enough to be termed as spam. As you can see, not even a single mail was read by the student. Many delete these mails straightaway.",
      "There have been cases when a person found something but didn’t know who the owner was. Later a mail titled “found” was circulated to every soul in the campus and still the owner couldn’t be located. Possible reason? The mail wasn’t read by the very person who lost the thing.And the students are not to be blamed. If X lost an object or Y found one, this is not something that the whole campus should be informed of. The indifference towards such mails by the campus junta render the mails useless. Added to this, students tend to ignore even other mails by DOSA which may be pertinent to them.To do away with these exasperating mails, actually help students find their belongings ( and help prompt substance into the mails by DOSA), some motivated students of IIT-K namely – Sohil Bansal, Abhimanyu Jaju and Atulya Shivam Shree have come up with an online- lost and found- portal. The link to the portal is:-http://students.iitk.ac.in/lnf/.",
      "",
      "The website has a lucid interface and aims at providing a handy platform to the people who have either lost or found something. This provides an advantage over the earlier mass-mailing ritual as only the concerned individuals will bother to visit the portal and others would not be troubled. Also, this will reserve webmail for more important information and announcements .Actually, what’s astonishing is why something like this took this long to surface when we all have had “lost and found sections” in our school which made finding lost stuff a hands down experience. But now we at the campus too have a lost and found section. Only, this one has an upper hand, as it is virtual.",
      "So, if you’ve lost or found something, simply post it on the portal. The success of the portal depends on us, the users. Instead of mailing DOSA, asking him to forward your mail and later be read by none, post on the portal so that if someone happens to find your belonging, the person can contact you directly.Such ingenious ideas can greatly simplify life on campus. The Vox team urges you all to make efforts towards identifying problems in and around the campus and come up with innovative solutions. A simple idea of yours might solve a problem that may be pestering a multitude.",
      "We have had examples when extremely simple ideas of some individuals had effectual results. A striking instance is that of the “Gopi Search”. Another example was the introduction of bag tags in library during the last end semester exams. It was a very simple idea that nearly brought down the bag exchanges to zero and also helped the webmail inbox stay clear of the plethora of extremely annoying “exchanged bag” mails.We are the stakeholders of the campus. We the partakers in the benefits as well. Just being aware towards your surroundings and conscious of the happenings can make all the difference. After all, only an aware and conscious student community can create a robust campus.P.S.- Vox sincerely hopes somebody takes up the task of revamping OARS.",

      "This article raises question on the selection of Rohan Bansal as the Chief Election Officer, Student’s Gymkhana 2014-15. This is an anonymous opinion voiced by a concerned student. Comments of President Students’ Gymkhana and Chairperson, Students’ Senate follow up the opinion piece.",
      "The involvement of students in campus administration is a distinctive feature of our campus. Hence its functioning is endowed with both- the priceless life experience of our faculty members in administering it as well as the vigor and new ideas brought in by young students. Students’ involvement is enacted by an apt division of power between the faculty members and the student body of the campus. Students exercise this power through their representatives. Hence its not only important for the student representatives to be approachable to their electorate, but each student must be given an equal chance to get elected as one of the representatives. This points to the importance of fair and free elections in the campus. If the election procedure is not glitch-free, it will not only harm the foundation of all constitutional provisions, but it will also engender the feeling of distrust among the students in the functioning of Students’ Gymkhana. The responsibility of conducting elections democratically is on the shoulders of Election Council, Students’ Gymkhana.",
      "One of the agenda items for the second meeting of Students’ Senate was the ratification of the selected candidate, Rohan Bansal, for the post of Chief Election Officer(CEO hereafter) for Students’ Gymkhana 2014-15. The candidate to be ratified for the post was the same person whose nomination for UG Y11 Senator, 2014 was canceled by the Election Council last year. His nomination wasn’t canceled because he tried to find out loopholes into the system and tried to deceive the governing body. But, he was one of those few (perhaps the only one), who showed an exceptional confidence in himself that in spite of not abiding by the rules and regulations of the Election Council, EC would not be able to do any harm to his nomination. Contrary to his belief, Election Council rejected his nomination. He came up with a manifesto which was a word to word match to one of the other candidate’s (currently a senator, Y11) manifesto. When the code of conduct is in effect, constitution clearly describes that no two candidates can work in collaboration. To hold the position of responsibility of a senator, he was not only too lethargic to think of the ways in which he wanted to transform the campus for the betterment of the students, but he did not even take a second to interchange the position of words in someone else’s manifesto.",
      "Objection was raised in the Students’ Senate by a few senators on his selection as CEO. There were two primary reasons in favor of Rohan. Firstly, his application was the best among all the candidates who applied for the post according to the selection committee, comprising of the Chairperson, Students’ Senate and the President, Students’ Gymkhana. Secondly, few senators were of the view that humans do commit mistakes, and everyone does deserves a second chance.",
      "And as a consequence, his name was ratified by full consensus. And so here is the situation – An election defaulter is now leading the Election Commission, to ensure free and fair elections.",
      "The situation engendered a need for challenging the selection and the ratification decision by the Students’ Gymkhana. A few students took the job. Some students went to DOSA under the impression that Constitution has vested in him such powers to overrule the decision. Unfortunately, they found out that DOSA was unwilling to interfere and wanted the students to handle the issue themselves.",
      "I have no personal grudges against the concerned person. But I write this article to apprise you that we all are watchdogs this year. Each and every one of you who wants their true representatives to be elected for next year’s Gymkhana should keep an eye on the activities of EC and must report any malpractice. This will maintain pressure on EC to function appropriately according to the constitution. Moving forward, I think that the defaulters should be prohibited from holding any position of responsibility in the next year. In fact, even some faculty members support this. In absence of any such provision till date, this year we have to rely completely on scrutiny of EC’s functioning by the whole electorate. Also to avoid situations like this in future, such suggestions should be taken into consideration by Students’ Senate and constitution must be amended to include such provisions. This whole episode points to the need of an independent judicial body in the campus so that even the decisions of Students’ Senate can be challenged. Current DOSA feels that even if he sees some discrepancies in the working of Gymkhana, the students see his intervention as using a ‘whip’ over the body and a disturbance in the distribution of power granted by the constitution. Hence installation of such a body will reduce workload of DOSA office, grant him redemption from such blames and at the same time, will ensure democratic and transparent functioning of the Gymkhana.",
      "To get the perspective of selection panel, Vox spoke to Abhimanyu Arora (President, Students’ Gymkhana) and Anurag Sahay (Chairperson, Students’ Senate).",
      "Abhimanyu says that in his opinion, the “offense” of Rohan in the past election was minor, and the EC was harsh by cancelling his nomination. “Rohan’s record as the President of HEC, Hall-2 is commendable, and I have no doubts in his leadership abilities. His candidature was way better than any other candidate.”, says Abhimanyu. He also conveyed that CEO doesn’t have dictatorial powers. EC team members are there to keep a check on CEO and making sure he is not misusing the vested powers.",
      "Anurag, in contrast with the President, does not believe that copying an election manifesto is a minor offense. Quoting Anurag, “The first time we called for nominations and conducted interviews, we could not find an apt-candidate. Hence, re-nominations were called, and among the applicants, Rohan was the best candidate. Given his past record, we could have considered calling for renomination for the second time. But that would have resulted in delay in conduction of upcoming DUGC/DPGC and Senate by-elections, to be held in first week of September.”",
      "Adding to that, the Chairperson says, “Any student (not just senators) has the right to come to a Senate meeting and object at any time – all of the students who went to the DOSA knew that the Senate meeting was happening and that the agenda including this ratification. If they truly believe the situation required interference, they should have come and aired their opinions in the Senate instead of approaching the Dean directly and compromising the integrity of the ratification process. Students’ Senate is the judicial body, and even now, if a student strongly feels that something wrong has taken place, all he/she need do is convince a Senator to file an agenda in the next Senate meeting to discuss this decision again, and the matter will be discussed again, despite their tardiness in objecting.”.",

      "He was the managing editor of the news channel IBN 7. He left his job with a dream in mind: to clean the dirty politics of India. He is the inspiration for the youth of India. Ardent follower of the philosophy that action speaks louder than words, Ashutosh Gupta talks to Vox Populi about journalism, politics, AAP and how does he plan to make a difference.",
      "Vox: Sir, journalism basically refers to the collection and dissemination of information to the audience. How do you define the objectives of journalism?",
      "Ashutosh: The public is the ultimate target of the media and therefore acting in their interest is both an ethical and pragmatic concern for the journalists. The entire world of journalism has undergone a huge change. Initially the main objective of journalism was to obtain information, filter it and accurately present it to the junta without any manipulations. But if we happen to look today, the scene is entirely different. The journalist today is more concerned about the new issues dominating the political scene and above all, change is the underlying theme of the socio-political discourse. They  collect information from all sources and report it to the people along with their point of view and I think there is nothing wrong with it.  For example, The Guardian newspaper follows the left ideology and The Economist magazine follows the right. Presenting your opinion is not a problem but manipulating the news so as to affect the opinion of people is wrong.",
      "Vox: Your views on objective journalism.",
      "Ashutosh: We have different newspapers in India. The same news when read in Times of India and when read in The Indian Express appears different. I believe there is no such thing as ‘objective information’ or ‘objective news reporting’. What I think will depend on the kind of socio-political upbringing I had. And therefore all this has added and abetted the collapse of objectivity as a journalistic standard. Objectivity makes us passive recipients of news rather than aggressive analyzers and propagators of it.",
      "Vox: You were at the head of the news channel and at the pinnacle of your journalistic career. And then politics happened. Why?",
      "Ashutosh: Traditional politics is something I always disliked and I never had plans to get into it. When AAP came into picture I realized that it was different. I observed their functioning and style of politics that they were into and their willingness to clean the dirty politics of our country. It influenced me to take this step.",
      "Vox: You wrote the book ‘ Anna- The 13 days that awakened India’ and also now since you are into politics, how do you deal with the criticism you receive?",
      "Ashutosh: Transition from journalism to politics changed my mindset and also the way I deal with things. Journalists are imperfect people doing a job that is crucial to the society. I always did things that I had a strong conviction for. Now, since I am into politics, I accept everything that comes my way and I feel motivated to create a difference to the society.",
      "Vox: A message for Journalism Society, IIT Kanpur",
      "Ashutosh: Journalists strive to keep the public’s trust because it is on the foundation of trust that the information is collected and exchanged. Honesty towards work is the main key. Always be true to information. Public trusts journalists to provide accurate and valuable information otherwise the journalist’s work will never be believed.",

      "For most, returning back home to India after a summer under a foreign sky is a joyous occasion to look forward to. However, there is one common observation in all the narratives – the overt difference one definitely senses as soon as one touches down in India. The roads, the people, the maintenance, everything is different to the worse. The only joy is getting back home, getting back to college, getting back to friends! However, after having spent a splendid summers at The University of Calgary, Canada under a 3-month internship period, I had to face a harsh reality; sometimes other things also take a turn for the worse!",
      "Registering for a new academic semester at IITK requires a student to be physically present in the campus at the stipulated date. Since the organization has to deal with a rich diversity of students from different backgrounds, students are provided with a flexibility in the form of a ‘late registration’ provision – in case a student is not able to register on the stipulated date due to reasons beyond the individual’s control (medical reasons, unavailability of train tickets, etc.), he/she can get registered a week later by paying a fine of INR 1000. For the semesters I have been in campus, the fine was waived off for the students submitting veritable proof of exigencies (medical prescriptions, train tickets). Those unable to provide such proof,get registered along with the fine. If this has been the protocol, there was certain breach of it this time!",
      "As it turns out, every semester roughly 10 per cent of the students opt for late registration, which is a huge number of exigencies for one single week. Another careful glance at the statistics and it is easy to see that there is some truth in the claim by the administration that the students are taking the provision leniently. As an economist, a valid argument could be that the marginal utility to a student of being at the place of his/her choice for another week, thereby extending the summer vacation or completing a summer intern, is more to the student than the cost of late registration. The demand for late registration is, thus apparently, quite high. Hence, in order to check the existing student behavior, the procedure for late registration now was lengthened and spiced up with reprimand directed towards the students at various outlets of the process of getting registered legitimately.",
      "A late registration procedure requires approval of the application by Chairman, SUGC.  In case the student is not a typical defaulter, there was no fuss made of the procedure and it used to be considerably, glitch-free. The present Chair in the authority had to however, be the strict disciplinarian and he would go by the rules, which are probably his own – he decided to base the case of each application on the merit of it (a good thing when you have the tenacity and patience to do it). It meant that the Chairman had to review applications equivalent to around 10 per cent of the student body, i.e. 600, in a span of a few hours. It also meant that the academic (DOAA) office would be flooded by students wishing to get registered.",
      "Apparently all was fine till lunch, when finally dawned the realization that going through 600 applications in a few hours was impossible and punitively forcing 600 students to drop the semester was also not a feasible option, all the students were allowed to register after signing an ‘undertaking’ –",
      "“The reasons stated by me for late registration are not compelling enough and such behavior, I shall not repeat in future.”",
      "Sorry Sir, where are we? In an institute of national importance or in the kindergarten? He may as well have asked us to write “Sorry, I would not trouble you’’, a hundred times.",
      "There are some flaws visible to me in following the above stated procedure. Firstly, the applications were not scrutinized before getting the ‘undertaking’ signed. Secondly, the students were figuratively made to sign this ex-officio document at gun point – told to sign it if they wished to get registered. So, there is a strong chance no one feels what they have written. Thirdly, for many students who had to reach campus after a hectic and tiring journey (like 48 hours non-stop for me with the jet lag), it seemed neither humanitarian nor ethical to ask them to go through this sadistic cameo!",
      "The focus of this article is now to contrast the recent positive changes in the administration of the country and that of IITK. One of the first issues that took center stage after formation of the new government was speeding up the administrative procedures by eliminating unnecessary paper work and wishing to do away with the red-tapistbabu behaviorby using technology. This policy does not hold true in our country alone, but countries like UK and Australia have also set up separate governmental organizations to speed up the functioning of the government.",
      "Institutions like IITs serve the students from different parts of the country. In such a scenario, the e-registration portal should be developed to facilitate students to get registered by the stipulated date without consumption of any time.It is true that introduction of e-registration at IITK might take some time but it does not make sense to move towards rigidity in a step function till constructive elaborate reforms. Also, following a procedure which is impossible to be completed in the available time is also no solution to check students’ undesirable behavior.",
      "Throughout three years of my stay on campus, I have observed administrative procedures becoming more cumbersome and rigid with time. There have been days during my stay on campus when I wanted to nail a hook on my wall but after going through a chain of authorities to get the permission for the same, my request was rejected!  And few say, IITK offers you the most liberal environment. Maybe we need to do a little more here.",
      "The infamous late registration day was just another instance. On enquiring the reason for the same from the Dean of Students’ Affairs (DOSA), I found out that such rebuttals from the administration were to be interpreted as repercussions of the indiscipline engendering in the student body. I sincerely appreciate the concerns of the administration to bring discipline to campus life but some people probably need to understand Mahatma Gandhi when he said that the future does not only depend upon the goal you choose but also upon the path chosen. The strictness and rigidity might lead us to a disciplined campus like the authorities desire but is this approach progressive or regressive?",
      "Update: In the 2014-15/3rd Meeting of the Senate held on 28th November, 2014, the Senate decided to allow all students to register late for any reason (subject to payment of the fine for late registration). Only in the case that a student wishes a waiver on the late registration fine will he/she have to request the Chairman, SUGC (for UG students) or DOAA (for PG students) to allow him/her to register with no late fee if he/she has a valid reason.",

      "Disclaimer: The points expressed here are my personal views on the placements at IIT Kanpur, which I was fortunate enough to experience as a core team member of the Students’ Placement Office.These are my observations and should be treated as such. Use your sense of judgement to tweak and implement them.",
      "How to prepare for the upcoming placement season?For all those people who are going to battle it out in the forthcoming placement season, here are some of my views on how to prepare for it.",
      "A) Where to start?",
      "Do you know what will really help you in preparing for the forthcoming placement season?",
      "Getting out of the comfort zone of your room and talking to people.",
      "It may sound old school but believe me, this actually works! Talk to your seniors, people from other IITs, your professors (regarding opportunities in Core engineering sector) and most importantly, the core team members of the SPO. They will provide you with the real picture. All of this will help you make an informed decision, will relieve you of your anxiety and in some cases, will even familiarize you with unexplored opportunities.",
      "B) We all want good placement, but what exactly is a ‘good placement’?",
      "You, my friend, have lived three full years at IIT. In school you might have been the best in class but that is not the case here, necessarily. You would always find someone here who is better than you and in every field: grades, research, extra-curricular activities, sports, scholarships, PORs, internships and what not.",
      "What is my point here? It’s simple. Stop comparing yourself with others!Instead set ground for yourself and pitch yourself against your true potential. Do not dream about castles which you cannot build. And please, do not burn yourself watching others build their own.",
      "To decide what is a good placement or a good company for you, look at the list of all the companies from the previous year and profile of the people they hired. See where you can make the cut and then come up with a three tier list:",
      "(a) Dream Company(b) Piece of Cake Company(c) Worst Case Scenario Company",
      "Focus on (a) only after you have prepared yourself well for smoothly making it in (b), which in turn means you are definitely not getting anything worse than (c).",
      "C)Bullet points of your Resume",
      "Here is the mantra for evaluating your resume. I have found out that this is how the companies do it. They take your resume and analyse it like a graph, your academic career graph.",
      "Your CPI, scholastic achievements, relevant courses, projects etc. are like a straight line curve for them. The more you have, the higher is your curve as compared to the others. But then you have the following things(among a few others):",
      "High CPI (above nine)Effective PORs (Overall Placement Coordinators, Counselling Service Coordinators, Festival Coordinators and General Secretaries)Intern/Project abroad.A research paper published in some reputed journal/conference/symposiumImpactful internships (i.e. an internship where you didn’t just learn, but made a considerable difference)National Recognition (of any kind)",
      "These, my friend, are the ‘spikes’ of your resume.",
      "So what exactly does this straight curve and these spikes signify?Well, it means that in case your resume is more like a straight curve i.e. average to above average achievements everywhere, you will be evaluated against a similar lot. However, if your curve is higher than theirs, you get shortlisted.",
      "What does this mean?Simply that if the lot who has applied for a particular company has average CPI around 8 and you have an 8.5, or if you have more scholastic achievements and activities or if you have decent internships coupled with good projects, your chance increases.",
      "Take a note that you do not need to score on all fronts. You might not have a foreign internship but may have good record in sports or extra curricular activies eg participation in Inter-IIT, that pretty much makes up for the lack of the former because in a straight line evaluation, things are additive and relative. Your good work in one field will compensate for lack of the same in the other field.",
      "Also, your curve will be evaluated against the lot who applies and hence the benchmarks will be set accordingly. So the bar would be high for the first few days of the placement season and then it gradually falls.On the other hand ,spikes are a different story. They are the highlights that truly attract the interviewers.",
      "Simply stated, the more spikes you have, the better are your chances of getting shortlisted irrespective of the competition. They are an absolute plus.",
      "The spikes can be company specific as well. For example, finance companies would love to see an exposure to finance in your resume (even though they claim otherwise in their PPTs) and analytics firms would love to see big data and consultancy exposure.",
      "D) Preparation and Targeting",
      "The bullet points on your resume aren’t enough.I have seen people with mind-blowing resume not making the cut in the top firms. I have also seen the flip side cases as well.",
      "Again, my point is simply this. You need to back yourself up with preparation.Do not confuse getting shortlisted with getting selected. The interviews are a great challenge!",
      "So how to go about it?",
      "i) Resume: Try to organize the aforementioned bullet points into a mind-blowing resume. Good presentation and working on your resume increases your Res-Score at least by 10-20%(I have seen cases with even greaters gain!)",
      "ii) GD-PI and Aptitude Preparation:",
      "Interviews and the other screening process (GDs and Tests) are things which shouldn’t be under-estimated. It may prove challenging even to the best. Again, it helps to talk to seniors about it and practicing on the lines of what the company usually asks. Many topics are repeated in various companies, eg ITC and HUL. One also gets to know the kind of GD a company will conduct and the skill set which the company personnel seeks in the candidate.",
      "GD: Plan with your room-mates or wing-mates. Prepare weekly and have mock sessions on various topics. Let some be based on financial news, some generic and some erratic. The more you practice, the better you become. Even those who feel that they have a good command over English, too SHOULD practice. GDs aren’t as much about the eloquence as they are about precision and substance.",
      "PI: There are 10-15 standard HR questions which one should be ready to tackle. You can find them almost anywhere so collect them and prepare your answers, and PRACTICE in front of a mirror.",
      "The more you write and prepare yourself for the PI, the better you perform and the more confidence you gain. DO NOT think that you will be able to speak spontaneously in front of the interview panel, it rarely happens.",
      "In summary, make the best possible use of your time. Get feedback, give feedback, analyse yourself but do not be excessively critical, that doesn’t help. Most importantly, develop a timeline and stick to it. Remember, early bird gets the worm, which is especially true in the case of placements. Try and be that early bird.",
      "iii)Company Information",
      "a) Read all about the company and the job profileb) Read about what makes them different from their competitorsc) Talk to the seniors about the selection process and how to prepare for itd) Connect with the company alumni online. After all, when else will that LinkedIn profile of yours come in handy?e) Attend ALL PPTs, make notes and try to ask questions. Every little detail matters.",

The quips were about the transition that a fresher goes through in his/her initial days on campus.",
      "The sound system began to malfunction by this point, which, coupled with the crowd’s cacophony, deemed the Dramatics Club performance that followed inaudible and incomprehensible, even to those seated in the first row. Nevertheless, the costumes and the expressions were commendable.",
      "Next up were the Fashion Show and the Fine Arts Club. There was a twist in the event placement this time, with the Fashion Show and Fine Arts performances being split in two and alternated.",
      "The glamour curve of the night reached its maxima during the Fashion Show. The audience was left dazed and bedazzled by the panache of the partakers.The ramp-walkers sizzled and sparkled on stage, their charm being accentuated by the use of props, such as frills, sparkles and even a guitar. An act which stood out was a male model who juggled three balls in the air.",
      "The Fine Arts Club gave two performances: sand art and speed art, both of which were remarkably well-received by the crowd. The former talked ofHarry Potter’s three deathly hallows, as the artist rendered the sand into a story. The latter performance saw the freshers drawing what initially seemed like random strokes on canvases, which were later put together beautifully to reveal a huge drawing of Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of the magic schoolHogwartsin theHarry Potterseries.",
      "",
      "The Dance Club lived up to the expectations, drowning the audience in their energy and enthusiasm. The dances had elements of classical and freestyle, among others.They engrossed the audience so much that the crowd stopped its antics during the performance, and couldn’t help but sway to the beat.",
      "A new event, “Mr. and Ms. Fresher”, affiliated with Antaragni was introduced this time. On the basis of forms distributed during the Orientation and subsequent interviews, three boys and three girls were shortlisted for the main event.",
      "",
      "The event comprised of two rounds. The participants had to showcase a talent of theirs in the first, and the second was a question-answer round which put them on the spot and tested their repartee.The winner among the boys was Rhic Chowdhury, and among the girls it was a tie between Srishti Jain and Riya Talati.“The winners of this competition will gain a direct entry to the finals of Mridaksh, the hunt for Mr. and Mrs. Antaragni,”said Srijan Shetty, the Head of Competitions and Events for Antaragni’14.",
      "The trademark(albeit somewhat controversial) dance of Hall 2,Bhokal, which the Y13 could not witness during their time, was finally staged. Even though it failed to meet the audience’s heightened expectations, the Hall 2 junta was delighted and proud.",
      "Several videos were interspersed between the events: the Orientation/Freshers’ Practice video (by FMC), which showcased snippets of memories from those times; the Antaragni and Udghosh promotional videos and a montage of freshers’ photographs, wherein they held white-boards to illustrate their answer to the question, “What brings out the crazy in you?” There was also a prize distribution for the winners of the creative writing competition conducted by ELS.",
      "The exit was meticulously planned to avoid any unsolicited incidents (which the freshers were apprehensive of). The seniors were made to exit first, and then the freshers were gathered by the HECs and escorted to their respective halls. Other security measures included ID card checking at the New SAC gate.  Further, the Anti-Ragging Committee and DOSA sir himself were vigilant till late night to ensure a flawless conclusion to the Freshers’ night.",

      "Just like last year’s Antaragni, Techkriti’14 created a huge post-fest furore. While the Antaragni issue seemed to be a battle of egos, the allegations levied in the Techkriti issue were of a more serious nature. At that time, there were at least a dozen rumors floating around and countless speculations. Now, Vox is here to sift through the pile of suppositions for actual facts. The primary official complaint revolves around the fact that a number of registration slips seem to be missing.",
      "A complaint was made against the hospitality coordinators by one of the festival coordinators and head, finance alleging that the hospitality coordinators had embezzled money. The hospitality coordinators claimed that they had given all the receipts to the core team and any disappearance could have occurred only after that. The hospitality coordinators even said that this was an attempt to frame them – they claimed that the core team had asked them for an “admission of guilt” in writing for embezzling money, even though they had done nothing of the sort. A complaint for ragging was also made by one of the hospitality coordinators against a few members of the core team who came to his room to intimidate and force him into admitting that he had misappropriated funds, claiming that they had proof of it on video. According to the complainant, a committee was set up to investigate this ragging incident but the findings of it have not been intimated to any student.Another remarkable aspect of the entire fiasco is the way workshop money was handled. Apparently, if a company charges an amount X for a workshop, the participant was made to pay an amount Y and the balance (Y-X) was kept for “other” uses. The bills for these “other” uses were produced only after the campus was rife with rumors about the Techkriti team funnelling money for personal use. Not just that, there was an almost overnight change in the number of registrations. The Students’ Senate was given two post conduction reports and around 300 more registration were mentioned in the second report, while the pre-fest conduction report didn’t talk about workshops at all. Maybe these really are just “human lapses” and we’re reading between the lines too much, but all of them occurring at the same time makes the entire thing look a little murky.",
      "Another thing of note is the erratic performance of card swiping machines used to take registration fees from participants this time (in order to make the registration process cashless). According to Karthik Balasundaram, who has handled more festivals than anybody else on campus (as a Finance Committee member for one year, as Convener, Students’ Senate for a short stint, and as Finance Convener for two consecutive years) and is the Convener of the Fact-Finding Committee set up by the Senate to look into these allegations, this isn’t a one-off incident. It was common in both Antaragni and Techkriti last year that the machines stopped working after five in the evening, when the banks close and nothing can be done about it. In Techkriti’14, both machines stopped working on Day 1. Maybe there were more participants coming in at night and the machine couldn’t handle the load. Maybe supermarkets like Big Bazaar have gotten hold of a superior card swiping machine than an institute like IITK (one of India’s premier technological colleges) does not not have access to, for its only inter-collegiate technical fest – supermarket machines are known to work day and night with a large volume of customers and yet rarely falter as often the fests’ apparently do..",
      "Karthik also goes on to say that the way money is handled in fests is highly unprofessional. No proper log books are maintained, it’s all very informal which is definitely not how a fest that has a budget of a crore should be handling its money. If students cannot handle the money properly, then maybe we should reduce the amount that we’re handling or bring in more people to handle finance. I personally have not seen any improvement in the quality of competition at Antaragni even though the budget has been increasing year by year by magnitudes approaching Rs. 15 Lakhs. Karthik says that this extra money is usually pumped into the final night and other professional shows as core teams usually work under the premise “final night chap gayi toh fest chap gaya”. But whatever the reasons, something needs to be done. Karthik believes that a more active involvement of the FAC (Festival Advisory Committee) can curb the problem to some extent. There has been a constant trend for the past 3 years that both fests have been going into deficit and the money has to be arranged by other sources. One of the reasons for that, the marketing team claims, is that companies delay post fest payments.",
      "Anyway, coming back to Techkriti. Another charge is like one of Enid Blyton’s kid detective books: “The mystery of the missing rubik’s cube”. In 2013, Techkriti had attempted to break the world record for the number of Rubik’s cube solved within an hour and for that purpose around 600 cubes were bought. These cubes were then handed over to Techkriti’14. The charge for the disappearance of the rubik’s cubes (RCs) has been levied on one Festival Coordinator by the other Festival Coordinator. Yes, they’re one big, happy saas-bahu family. But the drama aside, the registration receipts are still at large and the culprit(s) is/are sure not going to divulge any information about their whereabouts. The post-fest sponsorship deals’ money has still not been fully recovered (for both Antaragni and Techkriti) and the next Antaragni is already round the corner. This year’s team would probably have to bear the brunt for the sins of the last one. God help our fests!"

      "Hi! I am Mohit Sharma, Senior Undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Last winters, I was on a semester exchange to University of Waterloo, Canada and I write this article with an intention of encouraging student exchange programs in the institute. There are two main aspects of learning that come out of an exchange program, personal and academic and this article will elaborate on these one at a time.",
      "A semester abroad in a foreign university is like a crash course to life beyond the hallowed walls of the campus. You are exposed to a lot of new experiences all at once which gives you an opportunity to learn many things in a short duration of time. There are many challenges that you face, most of them for the first time, and you learn to deal with them outside the support system of your family and friends. This feeling of independence and accomplishment is highly gratifying for an average Indian student who has always had layers of support to fall back on. An exchange teaches you how to manage your everyday life when everything you need has to be done by nobody else but YOU! From grocery shopping to cooking your own food, from drawing lines between study time and party time to planning every day of the next week in advance, this life was totally different from my comfortable, impromptu decision taking life at IITK.",
      "",
      "So that was about individual learning, where you learn new things and acquire new sets of skills through individual chores and circumstances. But an exchange program also gives one the opportunity to grow as a person through interactions with the various kinds of people that you meet. You get an opportunity to immerse yourself in the culture of the host country, know about their food, tradition, beliefs, religion, festivals etc. and there are good things to pick in all of these that you never thought of before. Trying local sports and activities are other good things you may like to try at your new home. Your host university is very likely to have people from all over the world as exchange students. Hence most of what has been mentioned above for host country stands true for all countries that these students come from if you take the initiative to find out.",
      "A semester abroad is very likely to broaden your perspective to life in many ways through introspection and discussions. You are also exposed to new opportunities outside India. You get first-hand experience of studying/working in a foreign nation. It helps in taking informed decisions on higher studies and later on, employment. You end up with a new found respect for your family, friends and institute, and most remarkably for your nation, for its culture and traditions. Personally my love and respect for all of these increased exponentially due to this experience.",
      "There is a lot to experience in the education system outside India. It was always my wish to spend some time of my undergraduate study at a foreign institute and this exchange was a perfect realization of that. The in-class experience and research environment at University of Waterloo was very different from what I have seen at IITK and both have their own merits and demerits. There was a stark difference between the student life and approach towards education at University of Waterloo and again it felt great to be a part of it for one semester. I was impressed by the hard work and academic integrity that the students of the university displayed. I took courses with some of the top professors in my area of interest and receiving guidance from these front-end researchers was an out of the world experience. The course on Machine Learning by Dr. Shai Ben-David was one of its kind. There is always an opportunity to take a project under a professor, get a taste of research environment and even have collaborations for semester or summer break.",
      "There are opportunities of networking with people from all around the globe which can be crucial and life changing at times. Latest information about universities and jobs from the locals at different destinations of the world is helpful in taking many decisions. Having friends all over the globe is awesome for more than one reason!",
      "An exchange means lots of fun and adventure. Frequent parties, events and get-togethers lead to meeting every possible kind of person you can imagine and have discussions on endless topics. You get amazed by what the world has to offer by travelling to new places.",
      "",
      "There are certain things on the downside too that I would like to share and forewarn of. You must ensure that you get sufficient courses approved from IITK as well as your host university so that you have options to add/substitute once you reach their campus. IITK curriculum and course structure would usually be better/tougher/more advanced than undergraduate courses at some foreign universities. Hence, you should probably aim for graduate courses so that you can be sure that course is at par with similar course at IITK and you can get the credits transferred. Also from personal experience, these graduate courses are just superb and you actually get a lot to learn. Learning to cook is a handy skill because if you are a real foodie, it gets difficult and frustrating without good Indian food. It is not rocket science. I myself learnt everything in last the week before leaving for Canada. Further, it is an excellent idea to have atleast one other exchange student to give you company at the host university and be an equal partner in all your joyous moments and to share all your problems. It’s a long period in a totally different environment and academic settings. Malleability and will to excel academically without any help is required. Home sickness, missing friends and IIT is common and you should be strong and determined enough to face such emotional challenges. You need to boost yourself up everytime to get the maximum out of the opportunity and as I said it becomes lot easier if you have a friend with you.",
      "",
      "A big question that naturally arises is where should I go for an exchange. I have the following opinion which is very personal. The destination should not be purely decided by University rankings. Having done an exchange, I feel that undoubtedly quality of education is an important criteria but equally important would be factors like the country you are visiting, would there be a language barrier, how can that particular city add to your exchange experience, how many other exchange students from what all parts of the world would you get to interact with, so on and so forth. It’s a very broad thing and should not be narrowed down to 3-4 courses that you will be doing on the exchange because that is just part of the reason you are doing it. It can be a good idea to try a place where say you would probably like to go for your graduate studies, experience the academic and research culture there. So just decide your priorities and what you want to get out of it and make the decision accordingly. It can range from “ I want to see Europe , its culture and travel around” to “I want to experience education in a North American university and take a course X under that great guy Y”. It is very much personal.",
      "To conclude, I would highly recommend anyone interested to take initiative and contact Office of International Relations for possible destinations. It could be a life changing experience, to say the least.",
      "Happy Exchange!!",

      "In the August of 2013, Entrepreneurship Cell of IIT Kanpur added another event to the calendar to promote entrepreneurship in the campus . Having taken up numerous initiatives in the past few years to encourage young inventors on campus to make their innovations commercial, a need was felt to introduce the fest, which makes an integral part of campus activities in universities and institutes in and around Kanpur and across the country.",

      "Various competitions took place with participants from both within and out of the campus.  To name a few, there was Mind-ur-Business, SoCha- Social Challenge and Pitch ur Product, with each competition designed to simulate real world situations and test the participants’ knowledge of the start up world.",
      "There was also a panel discussion on how enterprise funding mechanism works and participants had an opportunity for a one-on-one interaction session with a few of the venture capitalists and angel investors in the country.",

      "It all began with the workers in the institute not getting the minimum wages specified by the government. Meetings were held, committees were put in place but the issue remained far from being resolved. This and a plethora of such problems were discussed in an open discussion session held as part of “Hamara Manch”, a platform devised by the workers to voice their concerns, organised on the 15th of April. Also present amongst the gathering were a few members of the faculty and some people from the student community . The motive of the meeting was to initiate a dialogue between the providers of services and the users which includes the faculty and the student community. The massive gathering was ample testimony to the growing dissatisfaction among the workers regarding the facilities provided to them and fear regarding their future. Representatives from various sections viz. construction workers, dhobis, rickshaw-wallahs, hawkers and mess workers voiced their concerns and blamed the administration for being indifferent to their grievances. Inadequate sanitary facilities , education and lack of a secure working environment were common issues causing disgruntlement among the workers. Moreover, the construction workers were annoyed by the fact that in a case where the contractor had violated the minimum wages law , the institute did not take note and offered the constructor another project, while the workers were thrown out for raising their voices. The dhobis were unhappy with the lack of proper sanitation facilities at the dhobi ghats and with instances of their children being refused admission into the Campus School. They were also concerned with the lack of uniformity in the various rates decided by the different hall HECs. Recent changes like the introduction of washing machines in the hostels have added to their plight. The rickshaw pullers were unhappy that they had not been allowed to hike their rates in accordance with inflation and that the tempo owners were trying to rob them of their business by picking up people from inside the campus. The hawkers were troubled by the incessant pestering by the SIS guards to move their carts and by the orders of the authorities to sell goods different from what they are accustomed to selling. The mess workers were concerned that they are being dealt an unfair hand as they have to serve a proportionately larger student group and they end up working more than is required according to the minimum wage norms. This is due to the fact that private messes do not have a shift system, which forces the workers to work for 16 hours a day . Moreover , their salaries are slashed in lieu of the food they get which is not even provided at times. The undertone of all the voices was that the authorities’ behaviour towards the workers had become highly apathetic. There were certain recommendations forthcoming from the “Sahakari Samiti” which for some time has been ensuring that the workers who are part of their cooperative get minimum wages and at times provides medical aid to the workers and their families using its own fund. After the presentation of their problems by various representatives and voicing of opinions by the faculty members present, the meeting summed up the discussion by putting certain demands (see below). Our take : We, sitting in the comfort of our rooms, have spent enough time thinking of the campus as over and above the tribulations of the world outside. As the student community and the faculty benefit a lot from the services provided by these workers, it is our responsibility to ensure that no injustice is meted out to them. There have been instances where student intervention has been of huge help like some time back in Hall 1, the mess secretary ensured that the daily wage workers also get to work in shifts so that they are not overburdened. It is up to the students to make sure that sections of the administration which do not realise the responsibility that comes along with their authority and which do not pay heed to their grievances should be brought to account for their lackadaisical attitude.",

      "best in the world. I am looking for a challenging",

      "Sounds familiar to anyone? Even if it doesn’t to some of you, it certainly does to about a million professors all over the globe. Its actually the latest topic of discussion and debate among the entire fraternity of professors worldwide. We have now gone truly global in every sense of the word. Well done IITKanpur. You might be thinking this is just normal routine; Third year students applying for summer internships and going abroad. However, we need go slightly deeper if we are to understand the intricacies of the whole situation. The problem has not been emerged overnight. Over the recent few years, it is a fact that there has been a gradual, but tremendous build-up of the urge to go abroad for doing internships, which has today snowballed into a desperation to flee India during the summers at any cost. As Prof. Bikramjit Basu puts it, “The faculty abroad gets the impression that the students here are just crazy to go abroad”. Now as no department other than CSE has en established IMS, this has led to thousands of e-mails being sent everyday by a thumping majority from a batch of more than 500 students for a period of more than 3 months. The already mind-boggling number has been further aided by the advent of softwares such as Atomic Mass Mailer which has caused the situation to hit the roof. The result: an unprecedented number of e-mails being sent by IIT Kanpur students for obtaining, what at the end of the day is just a 3 month summer internship, and not the end of life. But ironically, even that is not the problem. No professor gets irked just because students of IIT Kanpur, however large the number may be, want to work under him. That, on the contrary is a matter of privilege for the professors. What is really bothering is the fact, and this has been verified by talking to the faculty that on an average a professor abroad receives a dozen mails a day, all from IIT Kanpur students of the same department, and all with the exact same content. The notion this rightly sends out to the professor is that no thought is being given before sending these mails, thus undermining the professor and much more importantly, doing irreparable damage to the reputation of our institute. There are further anomalies as well worth mentioning. There have been several instances of emails being sent to our own faculty, many Ph.D. students and to faculty members of a department that has already taken students from IIT Kanpur. Such acts have further degraded the credibility of some of the really deserving applications. And just in case you think, the culprits here are only the third yearites, I’ve got news for you. The second year is not too far behind and if the trend continues a day might come in the next few years when the entire undergraduate community has a single-minded goal for the summers, to go foreign. Prof. PK Bhattacharya rightly argues that had summer training been so important at the end of second year, it would have been incorporated into the curriculum. Rather ironically, it must be noted that even at the end of the third year, only ME and CHE have summer training as a formal requirement. When you dish out a mail stating that you belong to the best institute of the country, shouldn’t you behave accordingly as well? However, expecting the students to place the reputation of the institute ahead of their own interests is perhaps unfortunately, asking for a bit too much.",

      "The Students’ Welfare Cell was established under the Presidential Council in the February of 2014. Ever since, the SWC has been working to address various issues that plague the student body, some of which include – implementation of the New ARC (academic review committee) policies such as minors and double majors, tackle the debacles that arise during pre-registration such as timetable clashes. execution of various policies that have been passed by the Students’ Senate but have not been implemented so far, addressing grievances of the students related to the gymkhana or their academics,  scholarships and dissemination of academic information in the student body. Ankur Pandey and Ankit Bhutani, the founding members of the SWC, along with the then Counselling Service Team conceptualized a special task force that is able to address the overwhelming number of problems that the student body faces.",
      "The SWC started off as a small group of motivated members that had the experience of working with various student bodies such as the Counselling Service, the Students’ Senate, and some institute bodies such as the SUGC, SSPC and the SSAC (For the freshmen, these bodies govern the undergraduate curriculum, scholarships and prizes, and student affairs including disciplinary action respectively) and students adept at web designing. With time, the SWC has seen more motivated students join in. Today, the SWC has 25 dedicated members under coordinators Pratik Rath and Sarthak Chandra.",
      "Since its inception, the SWC has been working on disseminating academic information through their website Arya. They have made an interface on which students on academic probation could compute the number of credits they would require to improve. In an attempt to make the cumbersome process of pre-registration easier, the SWC had released videos on how to use the OARS and how the OARS operates.",
      "The underlying objective being student welfare, the SWC aims at bridging the gap between the students and other bodies dedicated to the same cause such as the CS, the UGSAC, the SUGC, departmental committees like the DUGC and Students’ Gymkhana. The SWC is a body that can address all kinds of problem either on their own or by associating with relevant bodies.",
      "The coming year is very important for the SWC as the work they do will decide the direction the Cell takes in the future. The plan of action as of now is to ensure that the minor, double major and dual degree programmes are called on time and students have sufficient time to plan a course of action. The SWC would try to make the pre-registration process a hassle-free and smooth process by suggesting certain improvements to the OARS site and by ensuring that the number of timetable clashes are minimized. This would allow the students to actually exercise the academic freedom they have been promised by the institute. In coming years, the Cell wishes to put in place a program for academically deficient students, to help reduce their academic load until they are in a position to cope on their own. There are ongoing discussions about starting programmes for spoken and written english that aid students with language issues, as English is the sole medium of instruction in all courses.",
      "The New ARC (Academic Review Committee) policies have been implemented to allow for a broad-based education of the UG students as opposed to a department specific one. With 7-8 elective slots and 5 HSS courses in the course template, the students are now enabled to groom themselves in fields (of science, management and humanities) they think will be relevant to their careers. However, most students are not fully aware of the academic rules that govern their programmes and thereby are not able to make informed decisions. Therefore, one of the major concerns that the SWC has decided to address is Dissemination of Information. By regularly visiting UG wings and distributing leaflets, holding multiple interactive sessions, constantly updating their website Arya with all the relevant information, the SWC hopes to broaden their reach among the student body.",
      "The SWC’s work is essentially to act as middlemen between the administration and the students especially for students who do not know how to go about getting their work done. The need for such a cell is best described by Anurag Sahay, the Chairman, Students’ Senate and one of the first members of the SWC –  “One of the frequent criticisms levelled against the Gymkhana is that it never does anything for the benefit of the average student. The Students’ Welfare Cell is a small but significant step to address that, and to provide a place where students can bring any of their problems – you bring your problem to the SWC and we will do everything we can to solve your problem, whether it is with the UG Office, the DOSA Office, Hall Wardens, Courses or even the Gymkhana itself.”",

      "Hi Y14!",
      "As you embark upon the wonderful journey that you will cherish for your life, we asked some graduating batch people to do what they do best, fundebaazi! The life at IITK, especially the first few months, is replete with opportunities and the plethora of activities sometimes disconcerts even the best of us. It seems natural that the people who have been through the system and have successfully emerged as marvellous human beings, can guide the newcomers in this maze of challenges, so that they too are able to evolve and prepare themselves for the better things to come in the future. With this hope in our hearts, we collected and analysed messages from the ever-willing seniors, and now we present them to you.",
      "On Academics",
      "Some people become ardent coders, some become awesome managers, and yet others indulge in scientific and technological research. In this multitude of fields that people excel in, one thing is certain. If not anything else, IITK does teach you to become excellent engineers and scientists with the help of one of the coolest academic systems in the world. Academics is the thing that some of us can’t get enough of, while others just dread to think of it. However, hate it or like it, academics is something that all of us have to manage. We are lucky to be in an institute which believes in making the courses interesting and challenging at the same time.As most of the seniors repeatedly emphasize, academics is one of the most important spheres of life at IITK.Anant echoes the sentiment of the majority of the seniors interviewed when he remarks that attending classes should not be something that is taken lightly.Many seniors have often remarked that not attending classes was the blunder that they committed in their first year.Interestingly, almost all seniors unanimously agree that not giving the due importance to academics early on is the most glaring mistake of first yearites.Pritam sums it up wonderfully when he comments that first yearites often get involved in too many activities and end up messing up their academics. He also says that maintaining a healthy balance is very important.Samkit also stresses the most basic fact when he says, “A good CPI always makes things easier for you.” Yasho makes a cryptic remark when he says that the misconception that “CPI is important but a nine-pointer isn’t” is not exactly the kind of mindset that will help you. Apoorva emphasizes the subjectivity of academics when he says that many people wrongly believe that they will be able to manage academics like many of their friends without studying as much as they did during pre-JEE times.On the other hand, Niharika exhibits another facet of academics when she argues that although CPI is essential, the most important thing about academics is the knowledge that is gained by taking the courses seriously, which may come in handy at any point in life.She says that she regrets “…not studying academic courses sincerely. It’s not just about CPI. It’s about the wealth of knowledge you could gain that’s going waste. You never know, you might have been a good academician!”",
      "On Extra-Curriculars:",
      "One of the reasons you should be really excited about this place is because there are so many diverse people who surround you, with such varying interests that you are sure to find some hobby group or club that you’ll be interested in! Perhaps by the time you read this, you’d already have seen presentations by various societies as a part of the orientation program. Yasho says, “Come out of your rooms and do something you like, be it academic projects, student activities; discover your passion.” Welcome to this journey of self exploration! Anant says, once you take up something, do it with sincerity and dedication. Grab the opportunities that come your way or else you’ll end up regretting not having explored whatever you wanted to explore, like Anant who wanted to learn more about music but didn’t, or Apoorva, who regrets not developing reading habits and urges you all to.We’re all very proud of K-OS, our dance club! Courtesy: Photography Club",
      "The seniors, however, urge you to follow your own path, without giving in to peer pressure and/or senior pressure and taking up activities which you might find uninteresting just for the sake of it. “Don’t follow the herd, follow your passion” says Anant.They also caution you about not focusing on your Acads (academics) because of too many extracurriculars on your plate. Gopi regrets inefficient time management many a times during his four years here. According to Pritam, one huge mistake generally made by the first years is “Thinking that CPI is not important and getting involved in too many activities, only to mess up their acads. One should always maintain a balance!”.So embark on this journey, be excited and enthusiastic! Remember, (and this is something you are going to hear a LOT this year) “enthusiasm is the only prerequisite”!",
      "“Listen to all, but you have the final say in matters concerning you, you know your interests and what you want to do best! Do not let anyone tell you cannot do this or that.”-Gopi Ramena",
      "“Trash this: “What people think”Don’t ever let that stop you from doing what interests you-and “do it well”.”– Niharika Venkatesh",
      "“Whatever one wishes to do in IITK, there will most of the time be somebody who is smarter than him/her at that thing…. But there is no peer pressure, instead support from the other fellow to pursue that activity :)”– Pritam Thakur",
      "On Interaction (with wing and others):",
      "Many seniors stress the importance of opening up to people and making friends. Your wing is going to be an integral part of your life for these four years! They will be your family, your agony aunts, the people whom you go to when you’re sad, the people who’ll know all your embarrassing habits and yet be as fond of you as ever, and not to mention the people who will rob you dry when there are moments of celebration in your life. Apoorva places bulla sessions with wingies on his list of “must do-things for a fresher”, as does Gopi. According to him, all freshers should definitely do what is called a “night-out”. The graduating batch also talks of the importance of interaction with seniors. Yasho and Pritam both believe that the much-hyped quad sessions are definitely something to be experienced in the first year. “The freshers shouldn’t complain about minor issues there”, Yasho says. He says he regrets fighting with his hall seniors over petty Galaxy issues. Gopi also stressed the importance of exploring all clubs (Sports, Sci-Tech or Cultural) and making acquaintances with seniors and co-ordies of various clubs. Anant encourages you all to talk to the 4th years! “They are more than willing to help you guys out with anything”. So, Y14, get out of your rooms and interact with new people! It’s a new place, every new person you talk to, be it a senior or a batchmate, is sure to add something extra to your life.",
      "The y12 celebrating Holi ‘14. And by celebrating, we mean coloring every person who emerged from the TB(Tutorial Block). Courtesy – Johnson Kujur",
      "“Be sure to make the most of these four years and learn as much as you can for the best and smartest people will be around you. Look around you, interact with the people around you. Your seniors, your friends, the very people reading this along with you, will always be there to advise you, spend time with you, providing you with support and feedback, and a shoulder to cry on.”– Gopi Ramena",
      "“Helping someone with a problem gives you far more pleasure and satisfaction than wasting your day seeing a TV series on a laptop!”– Apoorva Goyal",
      "“Your time at IITK is going to be the best phase of your life. Never again will you receive such independence to pursue or learn whatever you wish; and never again will you have the company of such amazing and smart people around you. Make the best use of it without any fear of failure or being judged.”“ – Pritam Thakur",
      "Let’s sum it up:To end, we quote some of the choicest quotes out of the lot:",
      "“No one is going to make your dreams come true for you here! Just get up everyday and work towards the thing that are deepest in your heart and enjoy every step of the journey rather than wishing you were already where you wanted to end up.”– Apoorva Goyal",
      "“If you are anything like I was when I started, you are sitting there feeling a million different emotions and having a million different questions; but let me tell you that you are here because you deserve to be, and because you can bring something new and exciting to this diverse learning community.”– Gopi Ramena",
      "“On an emotional note, I will say you can take a person out of IIT but you can’t take the IIT out of that person. #Best4Years”– Pritam Thakur",
      "“Talent can cheat you but hard work never will.”– Anant Mundra",
      "And finally, two lines borrowed from Richard Feynman, quoted by Niharika:",
      "“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”",
      "“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”",
      "BIOS:",
      "",
      "Yashovardhan Bhagat was the FMC council general secretary (2012-2013). A lot of our batchmates got a glimpse of his awesomely helpful and cool nature in the TA202A lab. He’s sure gonna rock it at Flipkart.",
      "",
      "Anant Mundra, the General Secretary, Games and Sports Council (2013-2014), will be perhaps remembered most for the glorious way in which he led IITK to win its first GC in Inter-IIT sports meet, as well as being an exceptional badminton player. He got placed at Diamond Consultancy.",
      "",
      "Pritam Thakur has donned many hats in the campus. He was Asst. Coordinator, Counselling Service, 2012-13. In his final year, he founded Social Scribblers, to create a network of bloggers interested in social issues. He will be making it big at EXL!",
      "",
      "Apoorva Goyal, who was the coordinator (2013-2014) of the Counselling Service, is an eternal source of great advice. He has dabbled in a lot of fields like technical excellence in EE, entrepreneurship etc. while beautifully managing his academics at the same time. To top it all, he scored a PPO in ITC limited.",
      "Gopi Ramena is the one name known to all of the IITK junta ubiquitously due to the popular Student Search tool. Not many people however know that he is also the brains behind a lot other cool tech stuff going around in the campus too, along with excelling in academics. It doesn’t come as a surprise that he got placed at Samsung Electronics.",
      "",
      "Samkit Tated, the assistant coordinator (2012-2013) of the Counselling Service, is perhaps one of the most soft-spoken and brainy guys of Y10. Hailing from the MSE department, he got placed in Deutsche Bank.",

      "If you’re a person who loves solving riddles, if the word “adventure” makes adrenaline rush through your body, if you want to explore the campus or just want to make some new friends – treasure hunt is what might catch your fancy. Treasure hunt is a team game that is quite popular in colleges throughout the world and our IIT-Kanpur is no exception. As the name suggests, in treasure hunt, you’re supposed to hunt down the “treasures”. It’s the very first team activity with prize money that a fresher participates in (and might as well be your very first night out in the campus). The Freshers’ Treasure Hunt is organized jointly by ELS (English Literary Society) ,HSS (Hindi Sahitya Sabha) and the Quiz Club. Almost always it is theme based (generally the theme is the Antaragni theme) i.e. the whole treasure hunt props up a plot. Each team (consisting usually of 5 members) is given a clue, which when deciphered, divulges a location in the campus which has the next clue. This way, the team deciphering all the codes at the earliest is deemed the winner. Working out the mind-benders, cycling as fast as you can to the next clue, deceptive discussions to lead other teams to the wrong locations, “overhearing” the other teams ( always huddle your team while discussing confidential stuff to save yourself from this) – the fun and drama is exhilarating.",
      "To add to the drama and spice things up you may do some things yourself, like having a dress code for your team, using clock positions to show direction or go a step ahead and develop a rudimentary code language – because at the end of the day it’s more about how much fun you had rather than how well you did. Treasure hunt is an excellent way to have an upbeat time with friends (and possibly earn some bucks). Like when in “The Big Bang Theory”, Raj makes a scavenger hunt ( pretty similar to treasure hunt) for his buddies and they end up having a great time (though it ends a bit opposite to what Raj anticipated).",
      "The big hunt kicks off at the OAT (Open Air Theatre in case you didn’t know) at around 10 PM. To start off, your team is handed a list of things to be found. This is the scavenger hunt. You’re supposed to get as many as you can! The aforementioned list contains wacky items like:",
      "– Heart Shaped cushion",
      "– Photos with all the senators of y12",
      "– High heels (2.5 inch+, bonus for 4 inch+)",
      "And some normal items too ( bill from CCD, issue of Vox Populi, etc.).Then, if your team collects enough items to clear the cutoff after the scavenger hunt, your night just starts! The treasure hunt kicks off, and you’re given the first clue. The clue will be cryptic and once you break the code, it’ll lead you to some location in the campus. Hence, this is the perfect opportunity for you newbies to get lost and explore the huge, huge and beautiful campus we have! The clues will lead you to places where you’ve never been before, in fact to many places you’ve never heard of before, even (did you know there was a liquid nitrogen plant here?).",
      "The clues will be something like this:",
      "“Maltose is a sugar, more or less. Your destination lies in this substance. Take it, break it down. Analyse it, remove nothing from it, and there you have the location. “",
      "( From treasure hunt ’12)",
      "Solution : Remove “nothing” meaning 0 which would strongly hint towards removing the “o” from Maltose. Rearrange the remaining alphabets (MALTSE) to get SAMTEL. That’s your place!",
      "It’ll take you some time to figure out each clue. Sit with your teammates and apply your brains to decrypt the clue and you’ll have some of the most wonderful moments the whole night. At every point you will have to do some simple task like playing dumb charades, solving some word games, maybe even playing a bit of football! The treasure hunt will continue till 5 AM (sometimes, even later). And you’re sure to have some amazing memories of the treasure hunt, regardless of whether you win or not. This is definitely one event in which participation and the journey is completely worth it.",
      "So listen up people, don’t miss the treasure hunt. It’s an excuse to make new friends and explore as much of the campus as you can while having a lot of fun. So hope you y14 adventurers will turn up in huge numbers for the event.",
      "(The Literary Society and Quiz Club treasure hunt is generally held shortly after Freshers’ Night. Details will be sent to your webmail!)",

      "“An entrepreneur searches for change, responds to it and exploits opportunities. Innovation is a specific tool of an entrepreneur. Hence an effective entrepreneur converts a source into a resource” ~Peter Drucker",
      "Entrepreneurship is about solving real world problems using business as a tool! So say, for instance, your home city faces frequent power cuts. You have been really concerned about the same since childhood, and have been cursing the government for the lackluster performance. The one with an entrepreneurial mindset, will take the onus and attempt to solve this problem, by innovating in the alternate energy sector, and coming up with practical solutions to facilitate power distribution across the city, which are reliable and affordable. Setting the home city as a model, he will attempt to scale the solution across the country, across continents, realizing the vision of a world where every home is electrified! Most entrepreneurs are driven by a vision, a problem that they care about, and are motivated to give in everything to give life to their idea.",
      "Entrepreneurship is not a career choice. It’s an attitude, that you can exercise in any walk of your life. An attitude, that requires you to follow your dreams, live your passion, and have a firm belief  on self capabilities that you can make things happen.",
      "“Everything around you was created by people no smarter than you. And you can change that. You can build things that other people can use.” ~Steve Jobs",
      "IIT Kanpur, provides you aplethora of opportunities to cultivate this attitude. Aspiring entrepreneurs should make the best use of their time exploiting these resources, that will help them at crucial points in their entrepreneurial journey!",
      "1.Taking Initiatives:IIT Kanpur campus is not a perfect place. There are problems that you face on a regular basis in your student life, and that may have been persisting for quitesometime now. Talk to the relevant people, and see if you can come up with a solution. Work with the your HEC, or the Students’ Senateto implement your idea. Don’t procrastinate. Fight hard to ensure a better campus life for the IITK community.",
      "2.Campus Entrepreneurship Meetups: Get to know people at campus who areinvolved instartups, and are working on business ideas. We are building an active entrepreneurial community, where in people can get to know their counterparts, share resources, and learn from one another. The community meets regularly, and holds discussions on various aspects of entrepreneurship, pondering upon opportunities in various sectors and getting experts to share their experiences. Talk to your fellows abouttheir startup ideas.If you feel excited about someone’s work, approach that team and figure out how you can add value to their work. Get involved with them to gain some experience.",
      "3.Alumni Meets: We are fortunate to have a very resourceful alumni pool, who comprise the perfect lot to guide you on how to make the best out of your college days. They have been at your place, and can understand your situation. Talk to them about their student life, the decision flow that have shaped their career, and the mistakes they should have avoided. Learning from their experiences is invaluable. Reach out to them over email and social networks. And when they are on campus, catch them up to have an interesting conversation.As per my experience, most of the alums will help you tothe best of their capacity.",
      "4.Competitions: Participate in relevant competitions organized oncampus organized during Takneek and Techkriti.  Make sure that youparticipate in at leastone Busines Plan competitionbefore you graduate. If you participate seriously, you will learn a lot about the very first steps in starting-up, and who knows, that might be the business idea you want to take ahead!",
      "5.E-Cell Events: The entrepreneurship cell at IIT Kanpur is trying hard to create an ecosystem that supports and helps aspiring entrepreneurs. In the process, they invite successful startup founders, to talk about their entrepreneurial journey! Don’t miss an opportunityto catch them up for an informal conversation over dinner. It also conducts various workshops that serve to educate you about startups!",
      "6.SIPP :The best experience for an aspiring entrepreneur is to work at a startup. Some really good companies turn up to recruit interns via Startup Internship and Placement Programme(SIPP). Try getting into one you like. If there isn’t any, scroll through online portals with startup internships and drop them an email. You get to learn a lot working at a startup, given the small team size and the sense of ownership one experiences there.",
      "Its a general notion that there is a risk involved in building your company, and that is completely true.“What if I fail?”is the question that stops lot of people to experiment with their ideas, and take that next step. Quoting Mr.Ashish Gupta, IIT Kanpur alumnus and MD of Helion Ventures,“Risk is not in what you do, but how you do it”.With an IIT degree, you, by default, have a safety netto fall back on. It’s a privilegethat we should be making the best use of. The entrepreneurial ecosystem has been flourishing over the years at our campus. I do hope to see more excitement for startups and the hunger in the junta to build innovative products and businesses!",

      "Himanshu Agarwal, a graduate of 2014 batch, received the convocation award for Excellence in Community Services. Himanshu laid the foundation of Raktarpan – A student’s initiative started by NSS IIT Kanpur, which aims to tackle the grim situation of blood in Kanpur. It works to promote voluntary blood donation and to ensure that no person has to suffer due to shortage of blood. Here is the Raktarpan story, and a message from Himanshu for the IITK junta.",
      "“We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”",
      "16 months. 9 blood donation camps. 1000+ units collected. 3000+ lives saved and the best is yet to come.",
      "Everything except studies becomes interesting during mid-sems and end-sems. In one such end-semesters during Nov’12, Raktarpan was conceptualised as a result ofintellectual discussions thatwe had in our wing.. The big question was: how arepeople below the poverty lineable to get blood in dire need?",
      "Sachin (my room-mate) and I stayed back during the semester break and did extensive ground work. The aim was to devise the best method to help the impoverished and marginalised section of the society to get blood in emergency situations.",
      "We did not get surprised to know that Uttar Pradesh faces the maximum blood shortage in our country. According to one TOI report dated Dec 4, 2010 we got to know UP required 19 lacs units of blood but only six lacs units was collected through voluntary blood donation.",
      "To tackle the shortage of 13 lacs units shortage, we formed Ratkarpan, an organization to promote a culture of 100% non-remunerated voluntary blood donation.",
      "Upon proving our worth, we were wholeheartedlyfunded by Golden Jubilee Students’ Gymkhana team and Dr. H.C. Verma, N.S.S. Coordinator. Mr. Verma continues to fund our activities generously till date but regrets that medically he is now unfit to donate blood. So far, we have organized 9 blood donation camps, collected 1000+ blood units and saved 3000+ lives.",
      "It is commonplace scenario that many people are motivated weigh a POR by its popularity rather than its impact. The biggest challenge we faced was to find people genuinely interested and motivated to take Raktarpan to new heights once we leave the campus. It was difficult to find individuals who can overlook the so-called profile factor and are willing to give their invaluable time to an organization which is not so cool but focuses on doing some actual good work. We personally have seen a lot of good ideas being wasted in the frustration of finding good people.",
      "The other challenge we faced was tackling the myths and fears of IITK junta. It was a surprise to see how such afraid people are of needles.",
      "We often criticize many political organizations but do we ever introspect? Are we contributing enough to our society? Does the unlucky and underprivileged section of our society not need more of our time and effort?",
      "Do donate blood at our camps. You will be surprised at how good it feels to donate for a noble cause. We will love to have you guys on board to help us achieve our dream of 100% voluntary blood donation culture. Come and be a part of the revolution by ordinary people, doing ordinary work every day and somehow saving other ordinary lives.",
      "Follow your passion to change the world and you will eventually end up being indispensable in the society! GOOD LUCK."

      "Techkriti 2014 saw as its chief guest the celebrated and widely respected astrophysicist Dr. Walter H.G. Lewin. Professor Emeritus of Physics at MIT, Dr. Lewin has been the childhood hero of many a student across the world for his unique teaching style and nature as well as for his eccentric experiments. His video lectures on classical mechanics and electromagnetism have reached millions of people across the world through MIT OpenCourseWare and recently through the massive open online course destination site and online learning platform, edX. Dr. Lewin’s style of teaching and catchphrases have gained almost legendary proportions. Videos are made of his quintessential chalk markings while people emulate his loud and clear exclamations of “Aha!”. One of the most famous demonstrations is of course his swinging on a pendulum to prove that ‘physics works’! Add to that his candid declaration before his students after a successfully enlightening lecture – “All of you have now lost your virginity… in physics” and you have a teacher loved by all. Walter Lewin could proudly declare that he could make his students love physics whether they liked it or not.So, expectedly, his reputation preceded him. On the 5th of March 2014, the entire campus of IIT Kanpur was abuzz with news of the arrival of Dr. Lewin. Many were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him at CCD and photographs of him with the students went viral on the internet. Others preferred barging into his room – D008 at the Visitors’ Hostel. But Dr. Lewin was gracious enough to offer time to almost all the students, agreeing to talk with them at the CCD outlet, arguably his favourite place to hang out.  A connoisseur of coffee, Dr. Lewin, when not talking of physics and society and general problems of humanity, would express his love for espresso, the only civilized way of starting a morning!  Overcoming his hiccoughs of comprehending the Indian English accent, Dr. Lewin inquired about the educational scenario in India, voiced his opinions and his concerns and also expressed his mildly critical views of policies by various governments, India and beyond. Whatever he said and wherever he went, a rapt audience of eager students willing to meet their idol would be waiting!",
      "Hence it was expected that the Main Auditorium would be jam-packed for his talk, even at the supposedly ungodly hour of 10:00 pm. Some people even had to be left behind in the rush to witness the Dutch astrophysicist in action. And he did not disappoint. The audience listened in rapt attention to his lecture on the birth and death of stars, and their final fates. Dr. Lewin lectured on how several factors control their destinyen routeto becoming neutron stars, black holes or white dwarfs. And of course, a Lewin lecture without involving the audience in experiment is meaningless! So the attendees got to understand first-hand about the Doppler shift, using a tuning fork and a borrowed hammer to strike it with (the original hammer having been confiscated while entering India) – something that kept them at the edge of their seats. Informative explanations of the history of radio-pulsars being discovered was also given, along with the surreptitious removal of the removal of Jocelyn Bell’s name from the discovery – which according to him was probably one of the early cases of sexism in academia!",
      "Overall, the late-night lecture and the friendly nature of Walter Lewin was the topic of discussion on campus for days to come!",
      "Along with Lewin, the other famous physicist and educator to grace Techkriti was Prof. David. J. Griffiths. Almost all first-year students would be familiar with his name due to the immense popularity of his (in)famous bookIntroduction to Electrodynamics,a veritable Bible for the takers of the fresher’s course on electrodynamics.",
      "However, his popular talk focused on more fundamental aspects of physics – his current area of research being particle physics. After a hefty introduction by Prof. H.C. Verma, Griffiths proceeded to give a  detailed lecture about the current paradigms in particle physics with lucid explanations for even the uninitiated to grasp!",
      "Following the lecture was a more personal discussion session with the grandfatherly Griffiths, an unplugged version of him, in the Physics Department Seminar Room at the Faculty Building. It was there that he shared the joy (and pain) of academia; his love and affection for his thesis advisor and guide, the famous Sidney Coleman, who gave more impetus to Griffiths’ own way of research, rather than ‘guide’ explicitly. His good-mannered bushy-moustached face lit up at the questions on academic books, while he himself admitted about the influence of certain other books, namely Jackson’s, on his work! And so  The passion he had for spreading knowledge was evident from the caressing manner he adopted when writing in his soothing informal language to teach physics to the starry-eyed undergraduate! Sprinkled between his inspiring words and discussions on physics teaching were his own experiences of Reeds College and University of Utah, in the ‘middle of nowhere’! Add to that his obliging to sign his books for the eager students of IIT Kanpur!Techkriti 2014 turned out to be a treat for the lovers of Physics, and a fantastic learning experience for all! And thevox populihopes and demands for more such inspiring presence.",

      "Professor Lilavati Krishnan, from the HSS department, has retired from active teaching this year. She taught PSY151A almost every year for the incoming batch. She has left behind a rich legacy, as her unique style of teaching, combined with her exceptional oratory skills, has enriched the minds of hundreds of students. Even after 36 years at IIT Kanpur, she continues to exhibit the bright spark and the love for her subject even today. I enjoyed her course in my first semester at IITK. Hence, I grabbed the opportunity to have a chat with her. Here are some excerpts:",
      "DS: First of all ma’am, I wanted to ask that, how and why did you choose to specialize in social psychology? I mean, what was the motivation behind it?",
      "LK: Okay! Actually my getting into psychology, was very largely because of my observation of people. I just got interested in people and their behavior. When I was finishing school, used to go to this public library and I came across this book, and the author was Norman Munn. My contemporaries would know Norman Munn. He had written this excellent textbook on psychology, general psychology. And among many other books, I just picked it up. And I tell you, it changed many things in my career, you know, in the sense that I had never felt earlier that I would be interested in such things.",
      "DS: What are some of the most significant changes that you have seen over the years?",
      "LK: The physical environment of the campus has changed, and my feeling is that it has changed for the better, in the sense that the campus looks nice. I must say one thing though, this is just an impression, students used to be academically a little more curious. That is, they were interested in, if I may use that phrase, learning for the sake of learning. They were interested in marks, of course who is not, marks do matter. The primary aim was that, if you could learn well, you could score well. But even if you don’t score well, if you feel that you’ve learnt in a subject that was good enough. They said things like, ‘You may end up getting a B in spite of having worked hard, but never mind, it’s worth it.’ Now, a teacher hearing this, doesn’t need anything more than that. That used to be the spirit. And I don’t recall that students would come and say that where I got one mark less. I mean, that kind of questioning, I think, was much less. Attendance in class used to be very good. To say that it has gone down would be an understatement. It’s almost like students think that it’s not necessary to come to class. Now, we can look at the reasons. One reason was that there was nothing like PCs, no question of PowerPoint, no availability of notes, and so on. And students had this wonderful habit of taking notes in the class. And students would have this habit of going to the library, sitting there, reading the books, reading journals.",
      "So, the library used to be a very active place, and by the way, it was not only the students, faculty members also had to go there, because you could not get material from anywhere else, and it used to be fun, because the library was a fantastic place!",
      "DS: But ma’am, you said that students don’t take notes now, as they used to, as slides are available to them. But your teaching methodology includes providing slides to them. Why?",
      "LK: I provide slides, but I expect students to take notes! And by the way, many of them do (take notes). Those who don’t take notes, do suffer. Because the PowerPoint slides are not going to give you the lecture. They only give you the outline points of the lecture. And the students who do well, are typically those who don’t only take notes, but they take good notes, with a few exceptions that I have not been able to explain. I could not even think of not attending classes, for this reason: If I do not attend the classes, how would I know exactly what was taught in class?",
      "I believe that there has to be a rule about attendance, in the present scenario. It’s more to help the students, because even if the students come to the class half sleepy, something will go in. And that does make a big difference.",
      "DS: That sums it up, ma’am. Over the last 36 years, in your stay here at IITK, I am sure there would have been a lot of memories associated with this place. What are some of the few that stand out from the others?",
      "LK: (Laughs) It is very difficult to point out something specific, because it has been more of a global positive experience. In spite of the change in behavioral attitude change in students, one thing that I have been impressed with is, the discipline in the classroom. I think that’s excellent and it’s still very good. . So I have enjoyed teaching because, students have been very responsive. Most of the times, when you go into the class, you don’t feel that you are talking to walls, there is a dialogue. That has been, I would say, the most interesting and most memorable part of my teaching, as a whole. It’s difficult for me to specify instance, but now that you ask me, this is a very small instance, but it stands out. I remember the face of the student, I don’t remember his name. This was many years ago, sometime maybe in the 1980s. And recall that I just said that most students didn’t come asking for you know, ‘Why did I lose this one?’ and like that. And this is not a violation of what I said, but I’ll tell you what happened. So I handed back a quiz, maybe, and it had some multiple choice questions. So I was climbing up the stairs on the 6th floor, that’s where my office used to be, and so this student, a very participative person, and a very polite, well-behaved boy, came to me and said, ‘Excuse me ma’am, I have a question.’ So, he had shown me one item, where he had, as far as I could see, marked two items, and you know how it is. You are just supposed to mark only one alternative. I had already gone through the quiz in the class, what the correct answers were and why they were correct. So he was pointing this out, and said, ‘Actually, I meant this as my answer, and this happens to be the correct answer, but I did not get the marks.’ Now, it did not appear to me as though he had chosen a single alternative. But he was a very well-behaved boy, so I was listening to him, and I simply said, ‘Well, I believe what you are saying, but you see, now I cannot change it, because to me, these two appear to have been marked, and you know how it is.’ What was very positive was, as I was walking up the steps and he was walking up with me, he just stopped there on the step, and he said, ‘Ma’am, you’ve said that you believe me, and that is good enough for me!’",
      "He turned around and went away. Now, that kind of experience I have in my mind. I can’t remember the person’s name, I don’t think it matters. But the fact that a student can even say this! I won’t argue that students don’t have those values now, it’s just that it has not come up. I mean I don’t find students being responsive to these attributes, and that kind of behavior is rare.",
      "DS: Ma’am, you really enjoyed teaching here, right? So what motivated to take up teaching in the first place?",
      "LK: Okay, I don’t think I have seen myself to being suitable for any other profession. By the way, when you are teaching, you do research. You not only do the research, you incorporate the research into your teaching, in some form or the other. I personally don’t think a teacher can do a very good and effective job of teaching, unless the teacher is also a researcher. Research boosts your teaching. And yet, doing research opens everybody’s eyes to certain things, which enriches teaching.",
      "DS: What about the reverse thing, does teaching help in research?",
      "LK: Well, I suppose so, because when you teach, actually you get answers to many questions. Which is why it is said that every teacher is a learner. And that if you are out for learning, if you are keeping your feelers out, you can’t help but learn. So, given that you are also learning, there will be many insights that you get while teaching, which somehow builds into your research, in some form or the other.So, it’s not as though there was a conscious decision and I get up one day and say, ‘Now I’ve decided and I am going to be a teacher!’ Somehow, it came very naturally, research-teaching was the academic career, the vocation I was looking for.",
      "(Regarding the good things in the IIT teaching system)",
      "LK: I was amazed to find that there were many questions during the lecture. This makes the class very exciting. However, there’s also a challenge. How do I know what questions students are going to ask? There is absolutely no constraint.",
      "If the class size is large, however, they don’t feel like asking questions, something inhibits them. Whereas if it’s a smaller class, the likelihood of students asking questions is much larger.",
      "DS: So that’s why tutorials have been introduced.",
      "LK. Tutorials are a beautiful part of the system. Unfortunately, students don’t take enough advantage of the tutorials. At least, in my course, maybe in other courses also. I think they don’t see the point of it. But it is an extremely important and valuable kind of opportunity.It is one way, one occasion in which teachers interact with the students. When students miss out on that, what can it mean? Either they don’t care for that kind of personal touch or they don’t find it necessary. I don’t know what it is but things have changed. Tutorial attendance used to much better.",
      "DS: You have to go, so I will wrap up the session. What are your plans after this?",
      "LK: I have been saying this to some people. I have enjoyed teaching, there’s no question about it. I’m not going to rule out any other opportunity. After so many years of continuous teaching, I think it’s time that one takes a break. And I would like to do my own reading, studying, writing and so on which I have not been able to do. In general, some of the people who know me say, ‘Now you can do exactly what you want to do!’ After about 6 months, I will see. If there is some place, and I am missing teaching a lot, I’ll see. It’s not just teaching, I must add, our library is a very good place. It has a good collection, we have all sorts of, even electronics library facilities. I know that I am going to feel hampered by not having those facilities. So, if for no other reason, maybe I’ll join some place, after 6 months, so that I can be in touch with this academic world."

      "Of the many programs offered at the undergraduate level at IIT Kanpur, the newest one, chronologically, but not so much ideologically, is B Tech in Engineering Sciences.",
      "The program has been made available to the Y11 batch and onwards. Given the relative newness of the program, it is offered as a branch change option to the students in place of being a branch choice during JEE counselling. There is no minimum CPI criterion, however in case of an overflow of applications, CPI is to be taken into consideration.",
      "The program has two sub- streams, one is B. Tech. in Environment, Energy and Climate (EEC) and other in Mechanics, each with a maximum batch strength of 10 students. The Program Coordinator is Professor Anindya Chatterjee from the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and the PUGC is Professor Abhijit Kushari from the Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.",
      "With a Basic Sciences and B. Tech program already in place, one wonders as to why their is a need to introduce another program. The answer to this lies in the basic idea behind the program.",
      "At the very onset, the program was supposed to be an interdepartmental degree program, relevant for students who wanted to be entrepreneurs or non- engineers. Another thought process was that of being an exit option to save students from termination.",
      "With successive deliberations, it became an interdisciplinary program.",
      "According to Professor Chatterjee, the program began with the initial intention of providing a highly flexible environment for very bright students. As of now, the course template for each of the two streams has compulsory courses from multiple branches, ranging from Electrical Engineering to Civil Engineering. The aim is to equip the students with a set of skills in different areas of both scientific and technical knowledge.",
      "An amalgamation of different disciplines, this program, as advised by Professor Chatterjee himself, needs to be given careful attention, and aspiring students should go through the templates carefully before applying for it. In words of Professor Chatterjee himself, “As an advisor I would say that this programme is more suited for the academically oriented. Students should know their professional goals before applying for it.”",
      "The challenge has been to make it successful at the implementational level. A series of developments took place that gave the program its current form.",
      "It was during Professor SG Dhande’s term, nearing the end of July in 2011, that the institute decided to offer this program to the students. Committees were constituted, rounds of discussions and debates took place which got dragged on for a bit too long for it to be offered to the Y11 at the end of their first year. Then came March 2012. The program had still not assumed implementable form. Details were missing and consensus was still to be reached on how the program was to be carried out. In March 2012, a committee was formed, convened by Professor CS Upadhyaya, to discuss the details and it was to submit its report a month from the date the order was passed. However, due to certain differences of opinion within the Academic Senate, the report could not be completed till the end of the summer of 2013. The last date to apply for branch change, for Y11, was 28th of July 2013 and an information session was organised on 29th of July to introduce the students to the program. They were to decide whether they were applying for change by the 30th, which did not give them sufficient time to make a well informed decision.",
      "In an online survey conducted by a committee formed in the 9th meeting of the Students’ Senate in 2013, 15 respondents expressed that they would have liked to enrol in the program, had they been intimated well in advance.",
      "Currently, only one student from Y11 is enrolled in the program. The program was offered to the Y12 as a branch change option at the end of their third semester. As a result of this, the Y12 batch may have had to adjust their overall template in order to make place for Engg Sc. courses, as they had already chosen their ESOs for their third semester. Y13, however, will be offered the program after it has, hopefully, taken good shape, at the end of their first year and will have enough time to decide which ESOs to opt for.",
      "In the interview with Professor Chatterjee, he stressed greatly on the point that while changing to a new stream, such as this, a student will be giving up on some employability for academic orientation. It should not be looked upon as an escape route from another department as it is not the program that carries one through his/her academic career but attitude one carries.",

      "अहम् भोकालम् , Superheroes, Medieval Fantasy, The Mafia – Antaragni has ceaselessly captured my imagination year after year. But despite the fact that I swooned over these themes, I would be fibbing if I claimed that any of themes resonated with what Antaragni could be and what I wanted Antaragni to be. The only theme that could descry what I’m talking about is Antaragni ’09’s theme – ‘I am the change’. After reaching a certain point, an organization of the likes of Antaragni stops being just another student-run festival and becomes a vehicle of change. Legends like Vishal Dadlani, Raghu Dixit, Rahul Ram bear testimony to Antaragni’s legacy and it’s ability to infuse change.",
      "Antaragni stands today for the aspirations of thousands of students who after months of practice compete against the best in the country.Our vision for the festival was very clear, we wanted a theme that the students could identify with, a theme which was steeped in our rich culture and could portray the ambitions of the students who compete here. Choosing a theme which could be a mouthpiece of this sentiment was an uphill task. And after what seemed like an eternity, we came across this gem of a theme which we rejected out of hand. To be frank, it seems absurd in the beginning, but it  grew on all of us. ‘Aham Bhokalam’. You have to marvel the simplicity of the theme, it’s ability to mean different things to different people, its enigma and its closeness to our culture.",
      "Yes, the theme has caused its fair share of cause celebre. I for one believe, that the only way to appreciate it would be to let go of the negative connotations we have associated with the word ‘Bhokal’. ‘Aham Bhokalam’ perfectly portrays the spirit of Antaragni – the unfathomable power of the human will – of unleashing the power within. ‘Aham Bhokalam’ for us is a celebration of our indomitable spirit, of finding new meaning in conventional wisdoms, of creating our own paths, of exploring territories where no woman(or man) has ever gone before, to use that line, of being open to the different choices that people make.",
      "The crux of the theme I shall say, is that we can be what we want to be, with of course a zing of our homeland – Kanpur.",

      "Stretching your vision range will not do the trick,",
      "A plethora of bags all around, which one is your pick?",
      "Many students seek solace in the library as exams start to cross the dates on calendar. It is mildly amusing how productive the library turns us into, a day before the exam. Besides the evident pain of remembering the numerous equations and theories, that we have so efficiently procrastinated  until the last minute, we also have something additional to heighten the grievance barometer. No, I’m not talking about the herculean task of finding a chair to sit down, or the insufficiency of adequate power sockets. What then, you ask? The customary mix-up of bags is what I’m trying to get at.",
      "The misplacement of bags in the library has been an issue of serious concern.  The bags outnumber the racks and thus have to be kept haphazardly on the floor. Similarity of bags and  the exhaustion (after cramming) leads to confusion and as a result bags are exchanged. Now, the inconvenience caused while tracking down this misplaced bag is quite a messy affair. This issue also gulped in our already cluttered webmail, taken over by a pile of “Lost and Found” mails, so intensely that these mails from DOSA were considered as a proclamation: “Semester Exams Are Coming!”",
      "As the problem grew, it was decided that some measures must be taken against this troubling issue; the matter was put up for discussion in the Senate by Vedant Goenka, Senator, Y13.",
      "After a sound deliberation, a committee was constituted to come up with plausible solutions, one of which was the use of Bag Tags with full details of the owner, thereby letting you know when you have mistaken your bag for someone else’s. Bag Tag essentially is a tag which contains all the details and is tied around the bag by means of a string.",
      "Sohil Bansal, the then General Secretary, FMC took the onus of implementation. For implementation, a letter was forwarded to Mr.S.C Shrivastava, Deputy Director, IIT K regarding the same and permission was sought from the librarian, Mr.V.D.Shrivastava. The FMC designed the tags and initially, 500 prints were made available in the library.",
      "To quote Sohil, “We received large number of mails reporting bag exchange, with the start of end-semester examinations. It was the tipping point, and I chose to get the system implemented immediately and provided the library with these tags..”",
      "Bag Tags were appreciated widely by the campus students and reduced the exchange problem to a large extent. They got noticeably popular and started to finish as soon as they made their way, leaving many students (who were late in making the pilgrimage to the library) a tad bit sad that they could not get them.",
      "Reduction of the spam mails to zero was an additional reward for the brains behind this idea. As per Sohil, a similar solution is in progress to tackle the cycle exchange issue, where the name of the owner is likely to be imprinted on the cycle right at the time of purchase.",

      "After days, weeks and months of gruelling practice sessions, carefully planned meals and workout schedules, and intense discipline and self restraint, the Sports Contingent of IIT Kanpur began its week long quest for the General Championship at the 49th Inter IIT sports meet in the spellbindingly beautiful campus of IIT Guwahati. Each one had a single goal in mind- victory.  With years of struggling for the elusive and humongous, if one may, GC trophy, they were not ready to settle for less.",
      "",
      "Having sustained the biting cold of Kanpur during winter camp, when the Contingent set its feet on Guwahati soil, they were greeted with a pleasant weather and an even more pleasant start by the Cricket team. Things were looking good, with a comfortable start by the cricket team and a third place in the points tally as a result of the consistent efforts of the Aquatics team in October.",
      "",
      "Summary of the Aquatics Meet:",
      "The Aquatics meet commenced on 1st October, 2013, with Kanpur winning a bronze in 4x100m Freestyle Relay. Parth Tripathi won two gold and three silver medals in various events while Rohit Barnwal won a bronze in 200m backstroke. Harshita Varshney came second in 200m Breaststroke and the girls won another bronze in 4x50m Freestyle Relay. In the Water Polo matches Kanpur managed to reach the semi- finals stage but lost to Madras with a score of 7-6. Luck was not on Kanpur’s side in the match for the third place as well,  as we lost to Kharagpur by an unfortunate margin of one point.Overall, with the conclusion of the Aquatics Meet, Kanpur was at the third position on the leaderboard.",
      "",
      "The main meet, that took place in December, began with the customary march past event. While the contribution of attendance to the points tally was not compromised on, points were lost in execution and appearance and we were in the fourth position with 7 points out of ten, along with many other IITs. Participants were reprimanded for their nonchalant attitude and sloppy appearance.",
      "",
      "",
      "Day 1; 17th December, 2013:The first day saw a favourable outcome. Most of the pool- level matches were won and the field  was set for a challenging battle for each team on the second day. The basketball team put up a tough fight against the heavyweights of IIT Bombay but lost in both the Boys’ and Girls’ matches by close margins.",
      "",
      "The hockey, squash, volleyball and the newly formed football team won their matches right at the start putting us in a good position on the points tally. The prodigies from the Badminton team were off to a good start with wins from both the boys and girls. The weightlifting team, after having excelled in numerous district level tournaments, gave an average performance. Overall, the athletics team had their sprinters clear the heats and qualify for semis. Devi Mutyala of Y12 qualified for the finals of 400m and bagged the gold medal in Long Jump with a record leap of 4.48m.",
      "Day 2; 18th December, 2013:With sterling performances at the onset, IIT Kanpur was faced with tough competition from sister contingents on the second day. The hockey team won against the team from IIT Bombay and secured themselves a place in the semis.Volleyball  boys inflicted a brutal defeat on Madras, winning the match with a score of 3-0. Badminton boys gave the team from IITB  a run for its money and won with a score of 3-0. What could be called the cherry on the top of the proverbial cake was the 2- 0 victory of the TT girls in the match against IITD. Rai Singh Meena of the athletics team bagged gold in 1500m relay, with Deepak Bansal winning a bronze in the same event. Surya Prakash set another Inter IIT record for the institute and for himself, winning gold in high jump. It was not the year for the former Bronze winning team of Basketball girls as they lost in a match against Kharagpur with a score of 25- 29. This defeat marked their exit from the tournament. The young crusaders of the football team, having gotten off to a good start, lost in a tough struggle against the rookie team from IIT- BHU. They lost with a score of 0-3.",
      "The weightlifting team was out after the second day too.",
      "",
      "Day 3, 4; 19th, 20th December:What followed in the next few days can be aptly described as a ‘roller coaster ride’ for the troopers from IITK. The Boys’ GC was in sight. Having cleared the matches that took place on 19th and 20th December, we had made our way into four semi finals and were expecting to win an overall gold medal in athletics. The other IITs to look out for, in the tournament, were Madras, Bombay and Kharagpur. If any of the three had won silver in athletics, it could have spelled disaster for us. With a strong line-up in 4×400 m relay, Bombay had very good chances of doing so. Among the girls, the Volleyball team and the TT team made their way into the semis. The girls’ GC however, was a lost cause, with IIT Roorkee expected to clinch the title of Girls’ General Champions again.",
      "",
      "Day 5; 21st December 2013:We emerged victorious in four of the six semi-finals, namely Hockey, Girls’ Volleyball, Squash and Badminton. The matches for the third place were played in Girls’ Table Tennis and Boys’ Lawn Tennis.  Of all the matches to play in, if we had lost each one, we’d have ended up with a score of 59 on the points tally. Winning in just two out of the four would have landed us in a comfortable situation with 67 points. In the meanwhile, Madras had chances of scoring  a maximum of 67.5 points, if they managed to win a silver in Athletics.",
      "Day 6:With the help of a stellar performance from the Cricket Team,  we had another gold in our basket. Kanpur defeated Kharagpur by 5 wickets and redeemed itself after the Inter IIT meet at Kharagpur in December 2011.  Volleyball girls won us another gold medal. We lost all the other finals. Lawn Tennis Boys and TT Girls won their respective matches for the third place. At the end of all events, the score read as Kanpur: 65 and Madras: 65.5.",
      "",
      "Day 7:23rd December. The game of numbers had now begun. Kanpur was almost neck and neck with Madras in the GC campaign. While Kanpur had consolidated its hold on first place in Athletics, Madras’ performance was crucial to the overall GC struggle.",
      "To sum it up, with Bombay trailing behind Madras, the need of the hour was for them to overtake and come second. Only four events remained. Madras was at 32.5 points and Bombay at 18.",

      "madras: 32.5",
      "Madras: 35.5",

      "It all boiled down to the fourth and final event of the meet, the 4x400m relay. After a nail- biting duration of 180 seconds, Bombay scored gold, Kanpur won silver and with no sprinter in the 400m finals while Madras was unable to secure any position in the top four. This catapulted Bombay to the second position overall, with a score of 36 while Madras remained at 35.5. And hence Kanpur won the coveted General Championship, for the very first time in a span of 49 years of Inter- IIT sports’ meets, outdoing an opponent as formidable as IIT Madras.",
      "",
      "",
      "The closing ceremony of the meet was one that the Inter IIT contingent of 2013 will remember for years to come. To have broken the jinx and silenced the naysayers was a triumph of its own kind. The contingent members were called upon stage to receive the uncannily huge trophy. Anant Mundra, General Secretary of the Games and Sports Council for session 2013- 2014, addressed the exultant contingent members, pride and satisfaction evident in his tone and choice of words.",
      "This unprecedented victory of ours was celebrated with a luncheon at the Director’s residence. This was followed by a victory march all over the campus, leaving not a single Hall of Residence unbeknownst of its happening. With everything in place, the entire contingent concurs on the fact that there is a bigger challenge lying in wait at IIT Bombay in another cold December of 2014. It is that of defending the title of General Champion and preserving the reputation once created, in the sports meets to follow.",

      "THE SCENARIO",
      "When we go to have a cup of tea at MT with our friends, how often do we notice the person who is serving us? Do we notice whether this person is a child or not? And even if we do, how many of us are concerned about child labor as an underlying and intangible issue that is encouraged in this campus, consciously or otherwise. Vox Populi decided to investigate further and came up with the following rules that are supposed to be followed in the Institute.",
      "In general, The Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 clearly prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 in factories, mines and hazardous areas and regulates their working conditions in nonhazardous ones. And while these rules are to be followed, we know that children right from the age of 8 or 9 are employed in places like the Shopping Centre and MT. Their working hours, especially those who work in MT, are from 6 am to 7 pm. They have no time to go to school or receive formal education, let alone the expense being paid by the employer. Even the minimum wage rule is violated mercilessly by their employers.  And the sad part is that this is encouraged by the general indifference of the public and the apathy of the officials concerned, who are busy in naming each other as the “actual” authorities responsible. When members of the Vox Populi team approached the State Office official, Mr. K. N. Dhakale, enquiring about the rules and the state of child labor prevalent in the campus, he declared complete ignorance of the existence of such a problem here and named a Mr. Niranjan Das as the person responsible for handling cases of child labor. On repeated enquiries and assertions on our side, he sent one of his officers to enquire upon this and finally reported that they could not find a single child under employment! (which speaks volumes of the degraded system we live in). There are a few attempts to redeem the situation of these children, taken up independently by a few concerned individuals. For e.g., “Jagriti” is a rehabilitation centre run for these children where they are provided with food, shelter and education and is run by a fund by the faculty and staff. Also, the education of some of the children in MT is funded by a few students. Attempts were even made by few other students to provide them with night coaching. NGOs like Prayas and Shiksha Sopan also are working for the cause of such children. But these endeavors are few and far between, and not enough to improve the situation as a whole. And improve it cannot, when such an evil is thriving because of the unconscious support it is receiving from the majority of the people, because most of us here are too busy to stand for something as basic as the Right to Education of a fellow human being. It is us who are responsible for the ineffectual system that does nothing to improve the situation, because we never raise our voices against it. We are supposed to be the future of this country, but as we enter into this world, we have to remember that it is our responsibility to provide this country with another generation of a bright future, something we are not fulfilling presently.  It is time we woke up to the situation and join forces to erase this stigma from the campus for a start, and the country as a whole.  (Information as per the survey done in September’06)",

      "Dr Norman Dahl, a Mechanical Engineering Professor at MIT co-authored what is regarded as the Bible of Mechanics of Solids along with Dr Crandall. He also played a stellar role in establishing IITK and lived here from 1962-64. He passed away at an age of 85, of Alzheimer’s disease on Jan 11 2004. Following is a speech by an IITK alumnus, Dr Arvind in his remembrance at the memorial service. Dr Arvind was a student at IIT Kanpur from 1964 to 1969. After completing his Ph.D. at University of Minnesota, he went back to teach at IITK, in the mid 70s. Today he is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, at MIT. Vox Populi contacted him and obtained his permission to publish this article.) “February 28, 2004 “My introduction to Norman, like many other students in Kanpur, was through Crandall and Dahl, the venerable text book through which we learned our mechanics of solids. The book was full of insightful and fun problems and extremely well suited to handing out weekly problem sets; the problem sets around which the whole student life in IIT Kanpur revolved. It was only when I joined MIT a decade later I realized that this whole (torturous!) style of large lectures, small recitation sections, weekly assignments and associated laboratories had come from here. “The success of IIT graduates is now well recognized. There are books about it and Diane Sawyer of CBS did even a 60-Minute segment on it. What is less well known even in the United States is the pivotal role of America through IIT Kanpur in this success. “The Kanpur Indo American Program known as KIAP was formed to develop IIT Kanpur from 1962 to 1972. Norman was its first chairman from 1962-64. Dr Dahl, together with Dr Kelkar, the first director of IIT Kanpur, set out to create an engineering institution which was unique in the Indian setting. They succeeded! Being at IIT was so exciting for an undergraduate like me, because for the first time we came in contact with a large number of extraordinarily bright students and professors from all over India. As compared to any school or any university this place was totally open —-labs and libraries were open either round the clock or at least until midnight; one could check out as many books from the well stocked, air conditioned library as one wanted; the dorms had no rules, and were governed by students. On one hand we studied Schrödinger’s equations, on the other we took courses on Freud, Dostovoesky and Samuelson’s Economics! There were no external board exams. In spite of the heavy study load, the place was teeming with cultural and social activities. And of course IIT Kanpur was the first institution in India to get a computer. I still remember IBM 1620 being delivered on a bullock cart to the campus. The computer center was the place to hang out. If nothing else, it was at least air conditioned. “Norman’s impact on the whole high tech culture cannot be over emphasized. Consider this -Pandit Nehru conceived of five IITs and by design each was modeled after the educational system in a different country. IIT Bombay was supported by Russians, Madras by Germans, and Delhi by the British. Though the IITs had a joint entrance exam, and some agreement on core curriculum, each IIT in the sixties had a very different academic culture. Kanpur was by far the most progressive and the real testimony to the supremacy of the Kanpur curriculum was that within a decade, all the other IITs had copied it in every way. Today all IITs follow the American higher educational system. He is universally held in the highest regard by IIT Kanpur folk, even those who never had an opportunity to meet him. We, the alumni of Kanpur, feel proud of the Institution and also feel a gratitude towards it. Our gratitude extends to Norman Dahl, the man who made it all possible.",

      "When the going got tough, the tough got going – IITK Aquatics Team",
      "“Individual talents win games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” It may have been quoted several times in different contexts, but this is exactly what I felt in my final inter IIT aquatics meet this year when the IIT-K Aquatics team lifted the Water Polo Championship for the first time ever in its history in the recently held 42nd Inter IIT Aquatics Meet at Guwahati. An unprecedented run of victories inundated our team with an enormous sense of achievement as we ended up as champions in boys’ water polo and runners up in girls’ swimming. Pawan become the top scorer with 19 goals to his credit while Kush, Ankit, and Abhishek Gupta quelled the opponents with their unyielding temperament.  Last year, girls were champions in swimming and boys were runners up in water polo. The Aquatics team ‘founded’ by our alumni Avik Bhandari and Trishla Singh three years back as an assortment of “water polo-ignorant” swimmers has come a long way since. The sheer joy of accomplishment that stems from fulfillment of a long nurtured dream now permeates us all. More so because this was not the result of a freak cauldron of luck potion toppling on us, but the outcome of three years of plain hard work, three years of failures and three years of resilience.  Being thrashed 22-0 in IIT Delhi (due to lack of knowledge of rules) and then losing 4-5 in IIT Madras in 2004 to be knocked out of the tournament on the very first day would be enough for any team to lose all morale but we stood up to face the challenge. We sat there, watched and scrutinized all the matches, absorbing even the basic skills and strategies of attack and defence from all teams. After months of hard work and improvisation, we began our victory march at Roorkee by thrashing teams by scores like 14-0, the tables had turned and it was payback time. The league matches against Bombay and Delhi were cake walks and in the semifinals Kharagpur had to succumb to a 5-0 loss. In the finals against Madras, we came close but unfortunately not close enough and ended up as runners up. Many thought that their goalkeeper made the difference but I think we did not have the right temperament as we never thought that we would be able to make it to the final.  After Avik graduated the seniors stepped into his shoes comfortably and the team geared up for the next challenge. In Guwahati, the first match was against Roorkee, which we expected to be a well prepared team, and we were justified after a score of 1-0 after first quarter. But our attack demolished them in the next three quarters. The final score read 15-3. This win reinforced our confidence and faith. In the next match, we bruised the Bombay team’s egos yet again with a final score of 10-6.In the third match against Delhi, we devastated them 13-2, and each one of us, including the goalie was on the score sheet.  On 3rd October, a year after we had been beaten by Madras in Roorkee, we were up against them again.",
      "This was by far the longest, most exhausting and in the end most exhilarating water polo match ever played between any two teams. At full time, the game was tied at 5-5 due to the rock solid defense by both teams. The match remained undecided even after the extra time of play. Penalty shoot outs were the order of the day, with 5 to each team. When we were trailing 3-2 on penalties with Madras to take the next shot most of us thought that it was all over. Kush, who was guarding the post, stepped up to the occasion to maneuver a dramatic save bringing us back in the game. Ankit converted the last penalty that pushed the match into ‘Sudden Death’. Kush continued his magical run by saving the next penalty and then converted his shot which snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.  The stage was now all set for the final showdown against Bombay. After the first 8 minutes, we were trailing by 1-5 and asked for a time out. Our hearts were pounding loud in our ears and pulses soaring high. It was the time to put in that extra effort which can only be driven by years of longing for the moment which was before us. It had come again and we did not let it pass this time. In the next 6 minutes we turned the game on its head to lead 7-5 at half time. Eventually, after few hiccups the final score was 12-9 and the celebrations began as never before. The long wait for a gold to the IITK Water Polo team was finally over. When it comes to women’s events we don’t have a secret weapon. But Akanksha Gupta outdid all her earlier feats when she won GOLD medals in 4 out of the 5 events held namely 50m and 100m free style, 50m back stroke and 50m butterfly. Girls’ team comprising Shaheen, Akanksha, Kumud and Snigdha also won a silver medal in 4x50m relay all of them recording their best timings ever. In boys’ swimming events we had a better performance than last year with Ankit missing the bronze marginally in 100m breast stroke. Prateek Gupta showed promise as he recorded quite competitive timings in many events. The boys’ team comprising of Rahul Sharma, Ankit Jain, Prateek Gupta and Anurag Meena stood 4th in 4x100m relay free style. The team leapt over all hurdles that came in its way. We had seen a dream and made it come true. It has been an epic journey for all of us with a lot more to it than just sports. We will all cherish the moments when we laughed, cried, teased and huddled up together more than anything else in our lives. While lifting the trophy I remember seeing all eyes alit with our team motto: “One for All and All for One”.",
      "Coach: V. R. Vadi",
      "Team: Kush Shah, Abhishek Gupta, Swapnil Bhaskar, Ankit Jain, Pawan Kadyan, Rahul Sharma, Anurag Meena, Dharmananda Gahir, Vikas Joshi, Rohan Bhargava, Prateek Gupta, Shaheen Shah, Akanksha Gupta, Kumud Gautami, Snigdha Chaturvedi. A team comprises of each and everyone who has put in the efforts towards the cause. A special mention is due to Abhishek Poddar, Vikas Shingade and R N Kaushal; they deserve the laurels as much as anyone else.",

      "Techkriti & Megabucks merged; stick with the “Techkriti” brand-name.",
      "“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.”-Our campus community would beg to differ with Shakespeare, judging by the hullabaloo created while deciding the name of the technical and entrepreneurship festival to be held next year. It had been proposed to merge Techkriti and Megabucks into one festival by an amendment to the Constitution in the 9th meeting of the previous Students’ Senate. In order to look into the various issues regarding the structure of the new festival and to  implement this amalgamation smoothly, a committee was formed. The new structure was decided without much fuss with two festival coordinators (with an unofficial statement that they would be focusing on the technical and entrepreneurial aspects of the festival separately) and the usual structure of heads for events, marketing, PR etc. being acceptable to all. However, the one issue for which a consensus was difficult to be reached was the name of the new festival, which snowballed into a major controversial issue on campus. The question that whether we should stick to one of the original names or conceive a new name was discussed at great length in the Senate, which finally passed a resolution that a change was required in the nomenclature. However, there was an uproar against this decision, which was reflected in the signature campaign that got more than 1,500 participants. However, people in support of the decision cried foul and alleged that the document circulated for the  signatures contained misleading data. The issue had its fair share of drama in the open house meeting which was called to gauge the general opinion of the junta. People came out in large numbers to support the cause they upheld. Passionate speeches were delivered and heated arguments took place with neither group ready to compromise on their point of view . One of the major points raised by those in favour of retaining the name “Techkriti” was that Techkriti already had a huge brand name and it would be much easier for the marketing team to bring in sponsors. They were of the opinion that a new name would amount to wasting the efforts which had gone into building the brand for 15 long years and starting from scratch all over again. In addition to this, they pointed out that Techkriti already had some business events like the Bio-Business Plan which could be expanded and popularized.  The counter-argument was that it was unfair to compare these events of Techkriti with Megabucks, given the scale of the latter and not giving the entrepreneurship  aspect any representation in the name of the festival would effectively mean reducing it to nought . It was suggested that the name Techkriti would project the festival as mainly a technical one and students from top management schools would feel disinclined to participate in it. Those clamouring for a new name cited the example of the IT-BHU festival which emerged as a union of their Techtrix and Opulence and was renamed Magnum Opus. Also, in an attempt to satisfy the concerns regarding marketing, they claimed that IIT Kanpur was a bigger brand than Techkriti and it would be enough to attract sponsors. The meeting dispersed without reaching a conclusion but forced the Senate to rethink its decision. Another Senate meeting was called on 2nd April, wherein the matter was put to vote again. In a bid to keep in mind the interests of both groups, it was proposed that the name should be Techkriti with the tagline “the technical and entrepreneurial festival of IIT Kanpur” and the management events would be placed under the umbrella of “Megabucks” as part of Techkriti. The intention underlying this was that the marketing team could cash in on the brand “Megabucks” for the publicity of the business events, without losing out on the value of “Techkriti”. This was passed by the Senate with a clear majority and the matter was put to rest",

      "Tennis.. A racquet-ball sport played on a rectangular piece of land .. 78 feet in length and 36 feet in breadth .. the only thing you need to do .. NOT allow the ball to bounce twice in your part of the court.. 6 games in a Set .. 5 Sets in a match ..Seems pretty mundane and shallow, eh ?? Well, there’s more to it than just the racquet work .A game of Hope, A game of OpportunityIn tennis, you’re never out of the match .. Lost a point ? Win the Game and the lost point doesn’t even matter.. Lost the first 2 Sets ? Win the next 3 and the first 2 don’t matter. The hope on the tennis court never dies until the referee finally declares .. Game .. Set and Match ..Isn’t life too, about having this hope till the very last breath..? A champion like Jimmy Conors looks at a tough situation as an opportunity to outperform himself.. and interestingly he did do it every time.. Coming back from 2 sets to 0 down, ending up winning the match in a GRAND SLAM SEMIFINAL on 4 occasions.. A fighter like Novak Djokovic comes back after facing 2 Match Points against the great Roger Federer to end up winning .. again in a Grand Slam Semi Final..The significance of the lesson that these heroics give us is too big to get expressed in words.. Opportunity NEVER dies .. Unless You do ..A game of RedemptionIf you serve incorrectly, It is a Fault.. But then, first mistakes are always pardonable.. You get another chance to rectify your mistake.. Another mistake in serving.. Commit a Double Fault and you lose a point to your opponent..We often make mistakes in life.. To err is Human.. But, to err twice is Stupid…Tennis gives us this important lesson.. There cannot be an excuse to repeating your mistakes.. We have to keep on correcting our flaws and enriching our qualities..It is by Learning from the mistakes of our past and the mistakes made by our ancestors, we can think of improving as a society.. Repeating them again.. We’re giving away free ‘points’ to others…A game of DisciplineThe sidelines and the baseline sometimes literally haunt the players.. when on a given day every ball hit misses the line by millimeters.. The latest Hawk-eye technology must be really frustrating for players when they actually get to see on the big screen… by how little they missed to clip the line !It does not matter by how much you miss the line .. By millimeters or my Meters.. An ‘out’ ball is an ‘out’ ball .. I think it is EXACTLY the same with life.. A person who lives a life of dignity throughout, but commits that one single mistake is in fact remembered for that very mistake that he makes.. as they say .. “Being a good person is like being a Goalkeeper … It doesn’t matter how many you save… People will only remember the one that you missed.”We need to chalk out our lines of discipline and conduct for our lives similar to these lines on the court.. And, we MUST make sure we done cross those lines.. Not even by an Inch .. It is this discipline that marks the difference between many-a-talented individuals and the legends, that are so very few in number..A game of LuckLuck begins to play its part right at the very beginning at the toss.. and continues to do so throughout the game .. There have been incidents where ONE WRONG CALL has switched the hands that would have lifted the Trophies.. A doubtful ball may be called ‘in’ by one linesman and ‘out’ by another.. What makes the difference is having the right linesman calling your ball at the right Point..Isn’t Life too about meeting the Right people at the Right time .. being in the Right places at the Right time… Sometimes it is the people around you that make all the difference .. Tennis gives us the lesson of Luck.. Sometimes with Fortunate Victories and Sometimes with Bitter Defeats.. But then, we have to embrace the situation as it comes… or I should say ‘shake hands’ with it… Similar to what the players do across the net after the match is over..The Game of LifeHow similar is a Simple game of Tennis .. to the entire Journey of Life.. This is precisely the importance of sports in life .. When life throws all these scenarios at you.. you get the feeling of having ‘been there before’… The confidence of pulling out a tight match.. stays with us when we have to deal with the low moments in life..Life is a roller coaster ride and we must enjoy every moment of it.. The rise as well as the fall … Transferring all the guilt on destiny does not rectify what has already happened… we rather get the feeling of things being out of our control and into the hands of destiny for every next situation to come … We must remember that “we” have to hit those shots… “we” have to grind ..“The ball is always in our court” .. what to do with it .. Is up to us decide !!!",

      "‘Why do you run?’‘What do you think about when you’re running?’If only I had a coin for every time someone asked me this, I’d be pretty rich by now. Many a times, theseseemingly trivial queries got me thinking. Why do I ACTUALLY run? I honestly hadn’t given much thoughtto it until these questions started popping up. The most obvious, right-in-my-face kind of reason wasthat I felt good. It made me feel like life wasn’t so bad, after all. But then again, chicken biryani has thesame exhilarating effect as well. Then why do I put myself through this horrendous ordeal of pacingaround when I have other alternatives that don’t make me pant like my dog? I realized that it has to besomething more than a magical shortcut to adrenaline driven euphoria.What is it then that keeps me going? Think. THINK. I think a lot, when I run. I contemplate about myacademic progress, evaluate the pros and cons of asking someone out, wonder about the existence ofunicorns. Hell, I might as well find a cure for cancer while I’m at it. When I run, the entire world aroundme comes to a stand still. Absurd or not, it gives me a clearer perspective on life.Of how I should never stop pushing myself until I reach the finish line. To never give up in the face ofadversity even when my muscles tense up and strain, my chest can barely contain my pounding heartand the voices in my head .. oh how they scream! Begging me to stop, to let it go … that I’m no good.It’s astonishing how all these emotions can translate into the run that we call life. Every time I go againstthese voices, a feeling of accomplishment encompasses me. As the famous saying goes, ” It’s importantin life to not necessarily be strong .. but to feel strong “. Running provides me with that strength. It fillsme with hope, for now I know that I can take on any challenge that is thrown at me. And that folks, iswhy I do what I do.",

      "I entered IIT Kanpur with no formal training in sports. My only claim to fame was that I was the substitute goalkeeper of my class football team in school. So when my student guide at IIT Kanpurtold me about CPA trails, I was naturally skeptical. He told us – Whatever happens, don’t get stuck in NCC; it is very embarrassing. I decided to try my hand at swimming and to my surprise, my name was there in the list of 15 people selected.My first year was without any major spark. It was in my second year where I suddenly realized that if I put in effort, I could get into the team of 16. The Inter IIT was to be held in Kanpur and there was anticipation all around. My only chance of making the cut was if I got selected as the 4th person inthe freestyle relay team. There were as many as 4 people competing for this very spot and in the two months leading up to the Inter-IIT, I put in more effort than I had put into JEE. Every second reduced was a victory and all four aspirants were within a couple of seconds. Ultimately, I outperformed with a half second margin. In hindsight, this was the turning point of my stay at IITKanpur. As it turned out, we made history with a 20 point whitewash in Swimming and Water Polo. We were heroes in campus and walked about with pride.This was also the first time I witnessed the main meet. Being part of the organizing committee, I witnessed the action upfront. There was a growing buzz in campus that Kanpur would win the GC for the first time ever. A couple of days before the finals, we looked set. However, a string of semi-finaldefeats washed away all the aspirations. I watched the General Secretary of Bombay picking up the trophy amid all the cheers. It was then that I decided that I would contest for the post of GenSec. I wanted to be the first person from Kanpur to lift that cup!The Delhi Inter IIT (my third year) was like living a dream. We came in as overwhelming favourites – other teams were recording our practice sessions. However, the first game against Bombay was a cliff hanger – we scraped through 11-10. Our coach told us at half time – win this game and you willwin the championship. It turned out to be a prophecy – we won every subsequent match (4-2 Roorkee, 4-3 Madras and 3-2 Kharagpur). A particular moment of the final match will be forever etched in my mind – the game was tied 2 all with barely a minute left in the match. Kharagpur took atime out at this juncture. We decided to try out something new. Prateek (recipient of Insti Blues 2011) suggested that Dhruv would receive the ball and pass it to Aneesh. I would go to the 2 metre line and on receiving the ball, would shoot immediately without taking a foul. When the play resumed, the script played out exactly as we had planned. I don’t know how I took that back shot with the defender on top of me, but I do remember the referee’s whistle – we had won!My final year was a blur. I was elected GenSec and was buried under the work. One of the first things I wanted to tackle was the award ceremony of 2011. Most of the current students will associate the event with pomp and glamor, but it was not always like that. The ceremony used to be a drab affair with around 30-40 students attending. I had promised Cheka (the then convenor of the Students’ Senate) that we would make the event so successful that the Outreach Auditorium would run out of capacity. In the end, this did happen – formal attire was made mandatory for the first time and wehad award winners coming onto the stage in business suits!Simultaneously, I had my own team to mentor. It was a new look team going to Kharagpur that year and hopes weren’t very high. However, when we defeated Bombay (the strongest team on paper) 6-5 in the opener, people sat up and noticed. We followed it up with victories over Roorkee and Madras. Unfortunately our dream run was cut short – despite a valiant effort, we went down 6-4 to Bombay in the final- our first defeat in 12 appearances.I didn’t have a lot of time to brood over this loss. As soon as I came back to Kanpur, I was to address a more daunting task – building the contingent for the main meet. Having finished my own sport, I found it easier to attend the practice sessions of other teams. I wanted to make everyone believe that they were playing as a collective unit to win the championship – better known as contingent spirit. We had a talented bunch and I was hopeful. It was necessary that people in different teams knew and supported each other. Some of my initial efforts flopped spectacularly – a session of informal games was attended by only 30 contingent members (out of 150). Some others were moderately successful – two teams informally competing with each other in a third sport. I wanted every contingent member to feel privileged to be a part of the Inter-IIT experience. A new Durga Puja mess with better food was started to encourage students to stay back and practice. The food for the Inter-IIT camp was significantly enhanced – students looked forward to the meals. All of thiscontributed to a sense of elite-ness which was inculcated in the students.Unfortunately, as all of you would know, we did not win that year – we ended up 5th. However a there were many take-aways from the tournament. A tennis tie between Kanpur and Kharagpur stood out because at any given moment, we had more supporters in the crowd than the home team itself. In fact, is was special because throughout the length of the match, each of our teams came in to cheer at one point or the other. Our teams had never had the luxury of such support and I would like to believe that the crowd played a part in our victory. In the sport of athletics, Ashish Ganvir ran with a broken leg – moving the entire stadium to tears. We had a squash player who overcome his own physical limitations to reach the semis. We had a young badminton team which put aside an early loss to achieve a resounding victory, amplified by the last point – a ferocious smash. And these instances were few out of many!In the end, when we came 5th, there were a sense of deep disappointment which stuck with everyone. However, something magical had already happened – we gained a new resolve to avenge the loss because we believed that we were better than what the scores reflected. We collectively believed that we were capable of being champions – a feeling that I had never seen before in our teams. The younger ones took it upon themselves and were able to stage a comeback in their final year– Kanpur won the GC two years later.At a personal level, sports at IIT Kanpur taught me a lot of things. I made some of the best friends of my life, learnt how to manage time and resources. Most of all, I found a confidence within me – a belief that I am capable to doing whatever I desire to do, provided I put in my best efforts. This confidence has changed my personality and my outlook towards life. This feeling is echoed by a lot of my colleagues and I am very sure that with the sports culture now built in Kanpur, many more student athletes will follow."

      "Home Inter-IIT; my last one as a player; opening match; Madras in opposition, the anger of previous years’ pathetic refereeing; all wingies, seniors and juniors there to watch – too much was really at stake ! When the last quarter of the first water-polo match of 2009 Inter-IIT started game had been stuck at 4-2 for far too long. I took a good look around and could sense the tension on everyone’s faces. Just then a failed attempt at our goal and I knew it was time to break the deadlock. “Move-forward”, I told myself; “Swim-faster”, I repeated and I swam. By the time I reached the opponent’s side, Pulkit had scored. We were just sort of back in the game and then Aneesh and Pappu scored a goal each in the last two minutes. Opponents didn’t know what had hit them. Whenever I tell this story, I just like to quote that – “This, my friends, is what champions are made of ” That year, we went on to create history by winning both swimming and water-polo championships in the same year for the first time in over 4 decades. I was happy to just see my team-mates so ecstatic and this made me realize the value of a collective success over any individual achievement.",
      "",
      "As I recuperated from all the happiness, I remembered how it was only 3 years ago when I first came to IIT, how I was able to swim barely 50m and had never played water polo before. Over the years, the seniors in the team trained me, nurtured me and helped me as I strived to grow from the weakest contender to a core member of what we call the ‘aquatics family’. As I went on, my team mates practiced hard with me in pushing limits together, irrespective of break neck sprints, cramped legs or even red teary eyes from all the chlorine. It was this very hard work and this very team spirit that led us to the victory. When I joined aquatics in 2006, IIT Kanpur had just won its first medal ever and as I graduated in 2010, I was proud to have seen the development of a very cohesive culture in the aquatics team – a culture of striving together and more importantly, striving together ‘to win’. This very culture is the reason why I still continue to mentor the current team, why I travel every October to the Inter-IIT meets to cheer them and why we still win at the Inter-IIT every year (well, almost every year). This long journey of 8+ years with the IITK Aquatics family has taught me a lot of things, but most of all it has made me realize that the only thing greater, bigger and more important that winning is ‘winning again’ and while winning takes talent, teamwork, practice, stamina, skill, mindset and a whole lot of things that I can talk about, but what ‘winning again’ takes , in addition to all of above is ‘the culture’ that I refer to. When I was told that IITK had won its first ever general championship, I was really almost in tears. I remembered how me and Pappu would talk about this. How we would think about the day that this dream would come true and thanks to the efforts of numerous of you, that it did. But, I think there’s a whole lot that remains to be done even now – because as I mentioned earlier that the only thing greater, bigger and more important that winning is ‘winning again’. Best of luck for all upcoming Inter-IITs ! IITK ka tempo high hai !"

      "“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.”",
      "— Helen Keller",
      "An inter block hall tournament’s final was being played. It was a tense stage. As the scorer gave the scores – “twelve -fourteen”, a section of the audience shouted “Hindi mein bol”. Other parts of the audience whistled appreciatively. Later, as a person from the south was serving, another section of the audience started shouting “ille! pille!” (their conception of all South Indian languages) again to raucous cheers. People say these are comments made in the heat of battle, and should be given no significance. But these are no innocent statements, they are more like Freudian slips. They reveal a deep seated tendency which is current in the majority of IITK students. This article deals with the manifestation of this tendency in the apparent lack of “polish” in IITK graduates. The average IIT Kanpur student develops a certain skill set during his stay in the institute. Yes, every IIT graduate is an expert in writing exams and finishing assignments, but whither the “soft” skills which make the difference in a photo finish in a job interview? What does an interview board do with applicants who cannot interact with unfamiliar people, with superiors and inferiors? What use does it have for people who cannot tolerate differences in opinion and adapt to new conditions? It jettisons them. What can be the causes of this pressing problem? When we contacted Prof Manoj Harbola for his views on the subject, he said that composition of student population in the campus plays a major role. With a huge chunk of the students coming from places nearby, this place now lacks a cosmopolitan culture. The prevalence of the local UP culture has isolated other “minorities”. People with the same traditions and views tend to move around together. This cultural isolation makes it difficult for students to get to know other ways of life and learn how to co-exist. A classic demonstration of the hackneyed adage “Birds of a feather flock together.” Another instantiation of this phenomenon is the lack of communication with students from outside IIT Kanpur. Antaragni, and, to an extent, Udghosh and Techkriti now represent the sum and substance of our “efforts” to meet students of other colleges. Festivals and isolated events are but stepping stones to wider cohesion among students. The isolated location of the campus and the relative paucity of other local colleges are other possible contributors to this malaise. As put by Prof Harbola, an IITK student, over time, develops the attitude that he cannot learn anything from people from supposedly “inferior” colleges. Being in the intellectual bourgeoisie, why do we need to listen to the lesser ones? Alas! The tradition of lone wolves has passed on. The era of teamwork has dawned. Perceptions of the elite and the non-elite no longer hold in an intellectual democracy. In stark contrast, students in other IITs in metropolitan cities have healthy competition from of a lot of other local colleges. Students from different parts of the country intermingle in a veritable melting pot of cultures. Due to this, their students enjoy a campus life throbbing with vitality. Are these problems going to die out by themselves? Sadly, they aren’t. Take the skewed distribution of the students in the incoming batch. It is deteriorating with time. As it becomes narrower, the pressure of the old figures will bear down on new batches. This trend isn’t going to reverse itself. Take the location of the institute. It is a noble thought that this IIT will develop the surrounding areas. But isn’t the interaction two way? The environment of the institute also molds its students and its output. Till the chimera of development is actually achieved, the negative feedback will continue. To change this situation, the students must gear up to broaden their horizons. The reading rooms in the halls subscribe to magazines from different parts of the world. Some of the reading rooms are languishing due to lack of patrons. Similarly, news channels and the internet can help the students keep in touch with happenings in different parts of the world. The much treasured “bulla” sessions (the informal chat sessions which are rife in hostels) can be used like group discussions, to help develop informed opinions on important issues. Most students here do not have the habit of reading, for how can it be useful? These steps do not pay dividends in the narrow sense which most of the supposed “cream” of the country studying here perceive life, based on their limited experience. All these steps require a personal initiative and sincerity of attitude which is sorely missing in IITK students now. As the cliché goes – “true change can come only from within”.",

      "After days, weeks and months of gruelling practice sessions, carefully planned meals and workout schedules, and intense discipline and self restraint, the Sports Contingent of IIT Kanpur began its week long quest for the General Championship at the 49th Inter IIT sports meet in the spellbindingly beautiful campus of IIT Guwahati. Each one had a single goal in mind- victory.  With years of struggling for the elusive and humongous, if one may, GC trophy, they were not ready to settle for less.",
      "Having sustained the biting cold of Kanpur during winter camp, when the Contingent set its feet on Guwahati soil, they were greeted with a pleasant weather and an even more pleasant start by the Cricket team. Things were looking good, with a comfortable start by the cricket team and a third place in the points tally as a result of the consistent efforts of the Aquatics team in October.",
      "Summary of the Aquatics Meet:",
      "The Aquatics meet commenced on 1st October, 2013, with Kanpur winning a bronze in 4x100m Freestyle Relay. Parth Tripathi won two gold and three silver medals in various events while Rohit Barnwal won a bronze in 200m backstroke. Harshita Varshney came second in 200m Breaststroke and the girls won another bronze in 4x50m",
      "Freestyle Relay. In the Water Polo matches Kanpur managed to reach the semi- finals stage but lost to Madras with a score of 7-6. Luck was not on Kanpur’s side in the match for the third place as well,  as we lost to Kharagpur by an unfortunate margin of one point.Overall, with the conclusion of the Aquatics Meet, Kanpur was at the third position on the leaderboard.",
      "The main meet, that took place in December, began with the customary march past event. While the contribution of attendance to the points tally was not compromised on, points were lost in execution and appearance and we were in the fourth position with 7 points out of ten, along with many other IITs. Participants were reprimanded for their nonchalant attitude and sloppy appearance.",
      "Day 1; 17th December, 2013:The first day saw a favourable outcome. Most of the pool- level matches were won and the field  was set for a challenging battle for each team on the second day. The basketball team put up a tough fight against the heavyweights of IIT Bombay but lost in both the Boys’ and Girls’ matches by close margins.",
      "The hockey, squash, volleyball and the newly formed football team won their matches right at the start putting us in a good position on the points tally. The prodigies from the Badminton team were off to a good start with wins from both the boys and girls. The weightlifting team, after having excelled in numerous district level tournaments, gave an average performance. Overall, the athletics team had their sprinters clear the heats and qualify for semis. Devi Mutyala of Y12 qualified for the finals of 400m and bagged the gold medal in Long Jump with a record leap of 4.48m.",
      "Day 2; 18th December, 2013:With sterling performances at the onset, IIT Kanpur was faced with tough competition from sister contingents on the second day. The hockey team won against the team from IIT Bombay and secured themselves a place in the semis.Volleyball  boys inflicted a brutal defeat on Madras, winning the match with a score of 3-0. Badminton boys gave the team from IITB  a run for its money and won with a score of 3-0. What could be called the cherry on the top of the proverbial cake was the 2- 0 victory of the TT girls in the match against IITD. Rai Singh Meena of the athletics team bagged gold in 1500m relay, with Deepak Bansal winning a bronze in the same event. Surya Prakash set another Inter IIT record for the institute and for himself, winning gold in high jump. It was not the year for the former Bronze winning team of Basketball girls as they lost in a match against Kharagpur with a score of 25- 29. This defeat marked their exit from the tournament. The young crusaders of the football team, having gotten off to a good start, lost in a tough struggle against the rookie team from IIT- BHU. They lost with a score of 0-3.",
      "The weightlifting team was out after the second day too.",
      "Day 3, 4; 19th, 20th December:What followed in the next few days can be aptly described as a ‘roller coaster ride’ for the troopers from IITK. The Boys’ GC was in sight. Having cleared the matches that took place on 19th and 20th December, we had made our way into four semi finals and were expecting to win an overall gold medal in athletics. The other IITs to look out for, in the tournament, were Madras, Bombay and Kharagpur. If any of the three had won silver in athletics, it could have spelled disaster for us. With a strong line-up in 4×400 m relay, Bombay had very good chances of doing so. Among the girls, the Volleyball team and the TT team made their way into the semis. The girls’ GC however, was a lost cause, with IIT Roorkee expected to clinch the title of Girls’ General Champions again.",
      "Day 5; 21st December 2013:We emerged victorious in four of the six semi-finals, namely Hockey, Girls’ Volleyball, Squash and Badminton. The matches for the third place were played in Girls’ Table Tennis and Boys’ Lawn Tennis.  Of all the matches to play in, if we had lost each one, we’d have ended up with a score of 59 on the points tally. Winning in just two out of the four would have landed us in a comfortable situation with 67 points. In the meanwhile, Madras had chances of scoring  a maximum of 67.5 points, if they managed to win a silver in Athletics.",
      "Day 6:With the help of a stellar performance from the Cricket Team,  we had another gold in our basket. Kanpur defeated Kharagpur by 5 wickets and redeemed itself after the Inter IIT meet at Kharagpur in December 2011.  Volleyball girls won us another gold medal. We lost all the other finals. Lawn Tennis Boys and TT Girls won their respective matches for the third place. At the end of all events, the score read as Kanpur: 65 and Madras: 65.5.",
      "Day 7:23rd December. The game of numbers had now begun. Kanpur was almost neck and neck with Madras in the GC campaign. While Kanpur had consolidated its hold on first place in Athletics, Madras’ performance was crucial to the overall GC struggle.",
      "To sum it up, with Bombay trailing behind Madras, the need of the hour was for them to overtake and come second. Only four events remained. Madras was at 32.5 points and Bombay at 18.",
      "",
      "It all boiled down to the fourth and final event of the meet, the 4x400m relay. After a nail- biting duration of 180 seconds, Bombay scored gold, Kanpur won silver and with no sprinter in the 400m finals while Madras was unable to secure any position in the top four. This catapulted Bombay to the second position overall, with a score of 36 while Madras remained at 35.5. And hence Kanpur won the coveted General Championship, for the very first time in a span of 49 years of Inter- IIT sports’ meets, outdoing an opponent as formidable as IIT Madras.",
      "The closing ceremony of the meet was one that the Inter IIT contingent of 2013 will remember for years to come. To have broken the jinx and silenced the naysayers was a triumph of its own kind. The contingent members were called upon stage to receive the uncannily huge trophy. Anant Mundra, General Secretary of the Games and Sports Council for session 2013- 2014, addressed the exultant contingent members, pride and satisfaction evident in his tone and choice of words.",
      "This unprecedented victory of ours was celebrated with a luncheon at the Director’s residence. This was followed by a victory march all over the campus, leaving not a single Hall of Residence unbeknownst of its happening. With everything in place, the entire contingent concurs on the fact that there is a bigger challenge lying in wait at IIT Bombay in another cold December of 2014. It is that of defending the title of General Champion and preserving the reputation once created, in the sports meets to follow.",

      "What started as an innocuous page to allow students to vent  out their exam frustration soon spiralled out of hand as the posts became  contemptuous, derogatory and personal. Being the “brightest minds of  the country”, it is believed that the students would be prudent enough not to cross the tacit line  but the power of anonymity brought out the worst in all of us.",
      "Fortunately, there was a silver lining to all of this,  certain sensible fifth years, took it upon themselves to stop this  savagery. A post on the lines of “if you still  like this page, by the end of this day, I shall remove you from my  friend list” was made by a student. The post further urged the campus to follow suit. Other students also posted their disgust over the “rage page”. Prima facie, one might have shrugged off this post  considering it to be naive; but the impact of this post was far reaching, eliciting the required response. In no more than 12 hours,  the page was reported and removed from Zuckerberg land.",
      "Albeit the intentions of creating the page were innocuous,  we should be wary of the repercussions of such actions; especially with  the power of anonymity social media bestows.",

      "So one more year of disappointment. Out of top 100 JEE rankers, only two have joined IIT Kanpur. For someone belonging to the era where more than 50 joined IIT Kanpur, this is shocking, but it has been this way for a few years. And last year it was actually zero out of 100.Every year, after the JEE statistics are known, we have a discussion on the faculty mailing list. Some people will express shock while a majority would consider this insignificant.Some would say that it is more important to attract good PG students than to attract good UG students. Alright, but are we attracting good PG students compared to those IITs who are attracting higher JEE rankers. I think there is a correlation between the two, since attracting students is a function of our perception in the marketplace. If students perceive us as good they will come, otherwise not. And hence it is necessary to worry why this negative perception about IITK. Also, do we have to attract either good PG students or good UG students. Can’t we attract both. Shouldn’t we attract both.Then some fatalists would say that we can’t compete with metro IITs. Students today are looking for something that only metro cities can provide. What is it that these students are looking for. It seems that when students graduate from here, most of them are pretty happy with their stay here and seem to genuinely believe that they got everything that their friends in metro IITs got and then some more. Can we not leverage this good feelings to attract top rankers in both JEE and GATE.Some will argue that we can’t compete with metro IITs in placement and that is all that students look for at admission time. Unfortunately, these faculty members do not even know our own strengths, and are giving up too soon. Our placements are actually comparable to other IITs, and in certain perspectives, even better.Some would argue that there isn’t much difference between top 100 and the next 100. Lets accept that, but then are we attracting the next 100. Are they coming to IITK because they found something great about IITK. Or did they come to IITK because they couldn’t get into other IITs. Shouldn’t IITK be bothered if in each of its program/discipline, students prefer 2 or 3 other IITs before IITK.Some would argue that we should just do our job well, and not worry about perceptions. Good argument that. It is, of course, yet another debate on whether we are doing our job well. Whether the flexibility that our UG programs has on paper is for real. What percentage of our students are able to complete even minors, not to talk about second major, just to give one example. How many faculty members agree to let students from all departments to register in their courses. The add/drop period is on right now, and the number of queries I get from students asking me how to get any course in the Open Elective slot is not a small number. Of course, these are problems across the IIT system, and not specific to IIT Kanpur, as I found out recently in my meeting with Deans of other IITs.And hence we have an opportunity. If we can somehow create a culture where most faculty members permit students from outside the department to register for their courses, resulting in more number of minors, a greater number of graduates with wider horizons, a more positive student experience overall, I am sure we won’t have to do much more. So, yes, just doing our job well will attract more students.Of course, this will not be the end of the argument. Since as soon as you talk about doing more as a teacher, a new debate on teaching versus research will get started. It will be forgotten that I am really not talking about a higher teaching load, but just a more diversified load. So, the issue is really not of teaching versus research, but just a better student experience. I am sure an improved experience will make all these students to attract next year’s students and so on.We could also take up the task of communicating our huge strengths to our potential students and their parents.Our internal stake holders too need to be aware of those communications.",

      "CPI is really not as important as people make it out to be.",
      "My CPI at one point was around 5. I even got two F’s. There was one semester in which I got a CPI of 3.6. The “nobody” in the title is in quotes for a specific reason. The reason is even if you have a CPI of only 3, you really are not a “nobody”. There is a bright future ahead of you. Read on.",
      "I didn’t get a 3.6 that semester because I was genuinely struggling as a student. Very few people who get into IIT genuinely struggle with subject material because they aren’t up to the task. Very few people get F’s in spite of making efforts to attend classes, study regularly, do homework assignments on time, etc. They get F’s as a result of the choices that they make. I made the choice to focus on my rock band and music. I even wanted to leave IITK after my third semester to focus on music. Our band, Access Denied, won the runner-up spot in IITB’s premier rock competition, Livewire, in 2005. We were pretty serious about it! Midway somewhere, I got interested in linguistics. I then also met my future wife, and I had to get serious now about planning for a stable future. So I started going to classes, ended up graduating in 2009 with a 7.2 CPI. I got into a very good PhD program in Cognitive Psychology. I also got offers from top linguistics departments based on the work that I did with the linguistics professor in IITK.",
      "People do get low grades when they aren’t interested in the subjects being taught. Sometimes poor and uninspired teaching can turn away students from the classroom. I once had this thermodynamics class where the professor said in one of the first classes about how he wrote Pythagoras’ theorem 50 times on 3 sheets of paper to memorize it because he knew it would be important later in life. That approach to learning made me sick in my stomach. I was so disgusted that I made a conscious decision never to step back into his class again. I did not want to subject my brain to such nonsense. What is key though is to realize that such a decision is your own responsibility. Once you make that decision not to go to classes and not to attend quizzes/exams (I’ve done that), you need to realize that an F grade is impending and that in some ways, you made that choice for yourself. What I’m hoping you’ll get from my story are ways in which you can help yourself make the right choices that will help you graduate and be on your way to doing something that YOU love.",
      "What low CPI?",
      "Grades don’t matter to a lot of people contrary to what students are made to believe in IITK. When my applications were evaluated by grad schools, they only looked at my grades in the subjects I said I was interested in, namely linguistics, nonlinear dynamics, etc. I had good grades in those subjects. I had research projects to show that my interest in those areas was genuine.So the important thing is to develop interest in some thing or the other while you’re at IITK and do some kind of work to develop those interests and have something to show for it by the time you leave. These things that you do might be in complete contradiction with the requirements to get a high CPI.A high CPI does not matter really (of course, it might matter if you want to do a PhD in physics but you end up getting D’s in all your physics courses but I’m assuming that anybody who has a strong wish to do a PhD in physics will go to his/her physics classes and be diligent about it. The grades follow automatically).",
      "I knew a professor at IITK who treated students based on their CPI’s. He would ask us about our CPI anytime we met outside, for example at the shopping center. Once he happened to ask me that question after my third semester (the worst one). I replied “3.6″. He never bothered me since and I considered it good riddance! So it worked out quite well. So you see, there are certain advantages to having a low CPI too. I’m only half joking here because I will speak more about some pros later.",
      "Another example of the relatively low importance of CPI came during the time of placements.. At that time, I hadn’t decided yet if I wanted to do a PhD in psychology/linguistics and so I had decided to see if I could get a job through the placement cell at IITK. What I found was that I could pass most initial phase written tests, and I could get through to the final rounds of quite a few companies.Nobody expressed a concern about my CPI once I got to those final rounds.It only depends on how good your answers are in those interviews. They don’t ask you about Schrodinger’s equations in a Deustche Bank interview, they ask you about banking. If you know anything about that, and if that is what you’re interested in doing, then it isn’t very hard to get those jobs. Most of these companies just want bright people who have good mathematical skills. This is a requirement that they know everybody has passed when they come to interview people in an IIT. So just make sure you graduate somehow, and you really do have a bright future ahead of you, no matter what people on campus tell you about how you are doomed because of a low CPI. It is a blatant lie when people tell you that, don’t believe it for a second.",
      "So eventually, your CPI really doesn’t matter as much as you think it does. It only acts as a cutoff insomeinstances but you cannot do anything about it. If you don’t want to toil away for 4 years doing something that you absolutely hate and something that is contradictory to your principles of life, then don’t! Follow and ACT on your interests while you are there, as you will not get the time in the future to do that. By interests, I don’t necessarily mean academic interests. A band mate of mine, for instance had a CPI similar to mine. He was always playing music, thinking about film making, etc.He is now a film director doing exactly what he loves at his own pace and schedule, not something that all 10 pointers can claim today. Plenty of other examples exist. In fact, a lot of success stories that stand out as unique belong to people who graduated with low CPIs.I don’t have statistics to provide for it, it is just my perception based on my experiences and based on the personal anecdotes people have related to me. Thinking slightly more objectively, I believe there is virtually no difference in success rates based on CPIs. When applying for PhD programs, I never imagined that I would get so many offers. University College London offered me a position at a neuroscience center. All they wanted me for was because I studied at an IIT and I had studied physics and they believed that my knowledge would come to be of use in imaging the brain at their center. They offered to pay my expenses if I wanted to visit them first before I made a decision. This was really surprising to me at that time. I had no clue at that time why they would be do something like that. They didn’t care about how I did in my relativity course for instance. So CPI is really not as important as people make it out to be in the IITs. Of course it helps to have a decent CPI but the point is, even if you don’t, there is absolutely no reason to despair. You see hundreds of examples if you care to look, of how people with extremely low CPIs ended up tremendously successful and MORE IMPORTANTLY, successful doing jobs that they like!! I’m not very sure that the same can be said of many people with high CPIs, the McKinsey consultants for instance.I have trouble believing that they grew up wanting to be McKinsey consultants or even that they believed while in college that their life’s calling was to be a consultant!",
      "A low CPI can free you to pursue your dream",
      "A high CPI can open many doors for you. A high CPI is desirable if you can achieve it without putting your mind and body through torture. However, if you are one of those people who don’t enjoy working towards a high CPI and have alternative interests, let me tell you about the cons of a high CPI that many people don’t necessarily talk about. I’ve decided not to talk about the pros of a high CPI because everybody does it all the time. Nobody disputes that a good CPI does not hurt. However, a high CPI may be a constraining factor in some ways. People expect you to behave in certain ways when you have an extremely high CPI. If I had a CPI of 10 when I graduated with an Integrated MSc in physics, people would have tried to dissuade me from moving away from the field even if that is what I wanted. I had a friend who was brilliant in physics, had a decent CPI and people pestered him when he decided to opt for a job in the industry and not a PhD program in physics at the end of his five years there. So somehow, having a low CPI frees you from other people’s influences in many ways because you lower other people’s expectations. So there are pros and cons to having either a low or high CPI. However, none of these things matter eventually. You only have to look in the right place and think out of the box to end up with satisfying jobs and careers. Just make sure you graduate, that is all you need to do. I am currently at the top of most of my graduate level classes. I’m doing good interesting research and my professors are happy with me so far. The reason is, I’m doing something I’m genuinely interested in! I had the mathematical background to contribute to this field (I do mathematical modeling of human memory), andI took the time while I was in IIT to do the things that interested me: linguistics, psychology, philosophy, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, music, chess, etc. That is what really put me on a path to success.",
      "What about parental and other pressures?",
      "How did I handle parental pressure to pursue my own dreams? My parents were not the typical Indian parents. I’ve always made all my decisions for myself starting with expressing a desire to learn the piano at the age of 5. In the 10th standard, I was extremely interested in genetics. So what I did during those days was go around town meeting up with the local geneticists. When I went to the 11th and 12th, my interest shifted to physics. My mother is a chemistry lecturer and she likes physics too. So when I told her that I wanted to do physics, she had no objections whatsoever. Recently when deciding to go for higher studies, my mother wanted me to go on to do a PhD in physics but I told her that I wasn’t going to do that because I planned to do a PhD in cognitive psychology instead because I wanted to study the brain. That came out of the blue for her. She eventually understood. It helps to have supportive parents of course but if you don’t have supportive parents, you should learn to make your own roads and should learn to demonstrate that you are an individual who can think and act on your own. That brings me to my next point:",
      "Here is where I have another piece of advice for students. Try to do an internship or two during the summers, save some money. Some parents that I know like to tell their kids “As long as I’m paying for your education and for your applications, you better take into consideration my dreams for you”. In such situations, just say “thanks for all your help so far but this is a decision I must make for myself, I have some money that I’ll use to pay for the rest of my education and for my applications”. I had saved up about Rs 1 lakh from an internship in Europe. I used that to pay for the rest of my education at IITK and for my grad school applications. The reason was my father and mother were going through a divorce, and my father decided to tell me one fine day that he didn’t want to pay anymore for my IITK fees (because we didn’t get along so well). Fortunately, I could look him in the eyes and tell him that it was absolutely fine. IITK also gave me an extra-curricular scholarship called the Indradhanush Scholarship, which helped too. So what I want to tell the kids out there is that you cannot decide what kind of people you get as parents. They may be great people and may be extremely supportive of your interests and ideas, and sometimes they may not be. You shouldn’t have to depend on them forever to pay your fees, etc. So saving up your own money is extremely important!",
      "Get a girlfriend/boyfriend or at the very least mingle with the opposite sex!",
      "During my initial years at IITK, I started listening to Pink Floyd, and at the same time, my best friend who was in IITB at that time also developed an interest in that genre of music. We then decided to do a Pink Floyd tribute concert in our hometown. We publicized the event well, gave TV interviews about it (anything that an IITian does draws attention, it’s almost like people don’t expect IITians to be capable of anything but studies). The show was a huge success. We went on to form a band and we competed at LiveWire, IITB’s premier rock competition and came second overall just behind a professional rock band “Bhayanak Maut”. We beat them in the preliminary round, and the performance of our band had become a local news item.",
      "This initial success made us want to leave IIT and go pursue music full time. My mother did make a feeble attempt at convincing me to stay but she also sensed that I was depressed and unhappy in IITK at that time. Those days, I was exhibiting signs of depression. I had been sleeping during the day, awake at night watching movies, never stepping into class. So she said to me “pack your bags and come home”. I told her to wait until I was sure. I gave it serious thought. I ended up staying. In hindsight, that was a decision that I’m extremely glad I made! Since it was a decision I made for myself without anybody else’s input, I started attending classes and I slowly started rising to the top of some of my classes and my CPI steadily improved from there. I also took interesting elective courses in linguistics and philosophy which also boosted my grades. I did it out of interest though and not to boost my CPI. I did quite well and the linguistics professor took note and let me take a graduate level class with her along with her graduate student. So I got to read research papers in linguistics and realized that it was great fun.",
      "I met my future wife (we are now happily married) at the same tribute concert by the way. She is a singer. She was the other reason I went to my classes because I knew I had to be in a good position in order to be able to marry her after graduating. So another trick to being successful is: go out and mingle with the opposite sex.. find a friend, a girlfriend, a boyfriend! This is the time of your life when you can do that, not when you’re 70. I know Kanpur isn’t always the best place for that, but at least, go out and get involved in the various clubs and activities on campus where you might meet somebody. When you go back home, meet up with old friends. Do not shy away from mingling with the opposite sex *! I know it is easier said than done. The first step is to actually step out of your hostel room. Drag yourself to the SAC and go into the clubs and volunteer to help out.",
      "* Sexual orientation by the way is another source of stress for people with alternative orientations. India unfortunately is backward in that area and it is difficult to be open about it in India. I’ve seen it from close quarters and I’m very sensitive to this issue. So if anybody wants to converse with me about it, I welcome you to do so. I guarantee confidentiality.",
      "Advice to Students/Parents?",
      "My best friend (who is an alumnus of IITB and who was the drummer in my band) is currently a jazz performance and composition major at the prestigious Berklee College of Music, Boston. He has almost graduated now, he is planning to do a PhD in composition and his focus is on highly experimental music (with a lot of use of computers, and synthesizers, etc). He is also interested in cognitive science like me and intends to collaborate with such people in his composition endeavors. We also have examples of people like Gyanesh Pandey, an IITK alumnus Class of 2002, who has acted in Prakash Jha Productions Aarakshan (as a lawyer) and as a news anchor in Raajneeti. So people exist who follow really unique career paths after IIT.",
      "I think students need to know about the different tracks that people can take after their time at IIT. I just don’t think students and parents realize the immense variety of possibilities that exist if you just graduate from an IIT. Even if you drop out of there, there are plenty of success stories, but that’s another topic. With this write up, I want to encourage people to spend their time productively. “Productive” doesn’t necessarily mean getting a CPI > 9. A professor here, one of the world’s foremost experts on emotion, tells me that he shouldn’t hear from me that I work all day. The reason he quotes is that he sees too many grad students who say they are busy all day. They do work all day. However, that doesn’t mean they are intellectually productive. To be intellectually productive, he told me to realize the importance of leisure and the importance of thinking using that time. So just because somebody sits in front of a book from 9am to 9pm does not mean he is productive.",
      "In my opinion, some parents contribute a lot to students’ stress in addition to the academic pressures. In some cases of suicides, it was apparent that parents were not very supportive. So sessions must be organized that parents must compulsorily attend right when they come in for IIT-JEE counseling (as that’s the only time we can get all the parents and guardians in the same room at the same time). They need to be educated on the fact that they needn’t work any longer about their child’s future even if it turns out that they struggle with academics. So that should be the first level of attack.",
      "The next level should be in campuses where these sessions need to be held with student audiences. Alumni can directly make presentations at both these levels of interaction.",
      "Finally, I believe professors in IITs need to be educated on the fact that not everybody comes there with the idea of doing a PhD in that particular subject that they opted for. With the rank based choice of departments, it is more probable than not that people get streams that they do not like very much. In the US, undergraduate students make that choice of major only after a while of testing the waters. That option isn’t available in the IITs. Of course branch changes are possible but they are available only to people with the highest CPI’s. That is in a way contradictory to the goal! The idea is to help people who aren’t enjoying their subjects to shift focus. However, if they are getting high CPI’s, it must mean that boredom isn’t getting in their way of getting good grades. So a branch change does not take care of the core of that issue. In the absence of a process that addresses this issue, professors must realize that the students need to be treated equally regardless of whether or not they perform well in their subjects because students come in with a multitude of interests. Many principles of fair treatment of the students and ethics that are followed in US universities should be implemented in IITs.",
      "So to summarize, I believe education about this matter needs to be done at three levels: 1) parents 2) students 3) professors. Too often, professors and parents forget what it was like to be a student. Too often, even if they do remember, times have changed far too much to be able to draw reasonable comparisons. They need to be made aware of that. To the students reading this post, I hope I have convinced you that a low CPI is not the end of the world. In fact, it is very likely that there are very exciting things in store for you if you have the faith and if you believe us alumni when we tell you about our experiences as low CPI students who have made it reasonably well in the world.",
      "There should be an active forum for students to connect with alumni who are engaged in off-track careers. I hope this blog can serve as one such forum.",

      "An IITian who has worked for over four decades on issues of poverty, land and water, secure settlements, workplace safety, environmental planning, grassroots leadership training, and pollution control in both rural and urban communities. He has been a mentor to several generations of IITians – prodding them like Socrates to question the mainstream parameters of success to question the “should” and live a more “examined” life.",
      "“I pity those who graduate from IIT’s just to sell soap in the US,” he says caustically. According to him, Indian technical education is geared to meet global demands. The courses taught in IIT’s today serve the US more than our own country. Earlier it was not the case when a more integrated approach was followed and humanities, ethics, history of technology, and logic were also taught giving their due importance. But today the education is producing unreal, disconnected technologists. He urges the young students to ask questions, and not just be receivers of “wisdom”, and to “learn the laws of motion of society and not just the laws of motion of science.” There is so much that is needed to be done in India.",
      "The slightly frayed jeans and long silver hair tied into a ponytail give him the appearance of an aging beatnik, but unlike other aging beatniks, there’s still a spring in his step and an edgy excitement in his voice. In a  90-minute talk addressing a crowd of nearly a thousand IITians and other college students during the annual Techfest at IIT Bombay, he provokes his audience by calling them “big fools” who know nothing about India and its people. The IITians are victims of the politics of education and science. He goes on to say that environmental dynamics aren’t understood by engineers who seem to specialize in solving one problem to create another one, thereby creating a “sustainability for the engineering profession—and not for the people.”",
      "No, it wasn’t a frustrated or failed aspirant but a former IITian, Anubrotto Kumar Roy popularly known as Dunu Roy who uttered these words. Dunu obtained a B.Tech in 1967 and an M.Tech in 1969 in Chemical Engineering from IIT Bombay. As a friend and a former mentee put it, “Dunu Roy is a chemical engineer by training, social scientist by compulsion, and a political ecologist by choice.” He has worked for over four decades on issues of poverty, land and water, secure settlements, safe work, environmental planning, grassroots leadership training, and pollution control in both rural and urban communities. And now he is trying to educate people about the Hazards of urban development and renewal.",
      "Beginnings",
      "Dunu grew up in Dehradun where his father S C Roy taught at the famous Doon School. During the Second World War Maria Montessori was stranded in India for several years. Latika Roy – Dunu’s mother was trained by Maria Montessori herself at Kodaikanal and for many years ran the first Montessori school in Dehradun. Dunu and his two elder brothers were also educated at both the Montessori and Doon School. In school Dunu won numerous all India awards in both English and Hindi elocution as well as in sports and theatre.",
      "Latika Roy wanted one of her sons to become a medical doctor. This mantle fell on Dunu and he got into several medical colleges including the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Christian Medical College, Vellore. After cracking these tough exams Dunu rebelled and made up his mind to become an engineer. Next year he got into IIT Delhi where he had a severe attack of jaundice and had to return home and lost another year. Next year he was offered re-admission into IIT Delhi but again sat for the exams to get  into IIT Bombay from where he completed his BTech (Chemical in 1967) and MTech in1969.",
      "Why Would Anyone Want to Work for a Company?",
      "In the mid-sixties there was a massive earthquake in Koyna, Maharashtra. Socially conscious students wanted to do their little bit. As a student volunteer Dunu participated in building earthquake proof structures in Koyna. This motivated them to try extending the Green revolution technology that had just been invented. As enthusiastic engineering students they went to a village near Pune to teach the unsuspecting villagers about the benefits of hybrid seeds and chemical fertilizers. However, the villagers evinced no interest and remained skeptical because as practicing farmers they knew much more than what the students could teach them. But the students still wanted to help the villagers. In the morning they had seen many villagers squatting on the roadside and the women carrying their brasslotas. What the village evidently needed was a sanitary facility. Full of enthusiasm, the students once again fetched bricks, asbestos sheets, and a ceramic pot and constructed a toilet. They were proud of their social work.",
      "The next year they wanted to do more “social service” for which they needed some funds. “Get a photograph of the latrine we constructed last year. This will be good testimony of our social work and then people will donate money.” So, someone was dispatched to click a photograph. The photographer returned back saying, “The latrine is not being used for its intended purpose but as a goat shelter.” After the initial outrage, someone suggested that maybe the enthusiastic students had misjudged the needs of the people. This was a great lesson in humility. The urban educated middle class could go totally wrong while assessing the real needs of the people.",
      "“Those were heady days,” he says, talking about the 1970s. “The national dream was fraying; the Congress was, for the first time, being defeated; the wisdom of large-scale projects like the Bhakra dam was being questioned, and the increasing slum population in cities was challenging prevalent notions of development.” People’s movements were challenging the established order. Civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam marches, the environmental and feminist movements were impacting societal consciousness.",
      "The student movement had spread in India, and the IITs weren’t immune. “Unlike today,” says Roy, “a national spirit and feeling of community was alive in the student population.” Students came forward in large numbers to work in rural areas and to revive the aspirations of the freedom movement. There were many heated discussions in the hostel rooms about how the youth could participate.",
      "At this time, many Indian scientists who had made their mark in American Universities had returned to India to work or teach in the IITs. The notables were Prof. G. D. Agarwal (who joined IIT Kanpur and then became Member Secretary, Central Pollution Control Board) and Prof. P. K. Mehta (specialist in Cement technology who briefly worked at a cement plant in Sawaimadhopur) both from the University of California. They set up FREA – Front for Rapid Economic Advancement – an organization for the appropriate development of India. Their goal was to spur growth in small- and medium-sized industry.",
      "The idea to work for FREA appealed to Roy. “After three successive years of monotonous industry placements during summer breaks, I couldn’t imagine why anybody would want to do something like that after IIT,” he explains. The idea of working long office hours for a MNC did not suit Dunu Roy and he gave up his career as a chemical engineer. Instead, he made a two-year commitment to FREA on a meager salary. The initial objective was to set up a strong institution that would provide solid professional assistance to aspiring entrepreneurs. But sometime after he’d started work, the group realized the solution to the problems of small- and medium-sized industries lay not in better technological inputs but in better credit lines and market development. In other words, it would be difficult for them to effect any change on the ground.",
      "The programme then morphed into an effort to teach students about urban and rural development issues. The idea was to expose young minds to the larger reality of India – a reality steeped in poverty and exploitation. At first, IIT students were sent to remote tribal villages to experience the lives of the poor. They would live there for a few days and return back deeply stirred and devastated. The programme soon expanded into other colleges in Bombay and to students in other cities and towns. They would soon realize that people were poor not because they were lazy but because of the systematic exploitation of their resources by the elite. These intense experiences radicalized many young minds. The solutions to poverty were steeply rooted in economics and politics and could only be partially solved by technology or education.",
      "Two years commitment with FREA turned into four. In the four years that he spent with FREA, they spread to 14 locations around the country, working with Gandhian organizations, church institutions, independent groups and more than 400 students were being sent out for short term assignments every year.",
      "During those years, Roy worked all over India. The experience shaped his—and others’—future. “I realized,” he says, “that most developmental activities taking place in India at that time were micro-experiments, limited to either a cluster of villages or a few sectors like education and healthcare.” There was no understanding of the linkages between sectors; and the people who did work in villages, worked only to implement their own ideas of progress and development. “It was a top-down approach,” says Roy. “Nobody was asking the people what they wanted. They were talking to the people, not with the people.”",
      "Knowledge as a Weapon to Bring Change",
      "In the early 1970s the NGO model was heavily critiqued. The NGOs got their money from charitable trusts, the government or relied on foreign funds. They did not have to earn their living like ordinary people. Would people heed to such preachers? In 1975 Dunu, along with like-minded friends, started an experiment in the Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh, “Kaam aur Kamai” – to do meaningful social work while earning a living within the community. The outcome was theVidushak Karkhana– a small workshop to repair diesel pump sets and other rural machinery. It was a small commune where people lived and worked together while searching for a meaningful role for themselves.",
      "TheVidushak Karkhanaslowly evolved into the Shahdol Group to carry out focused work on building a development model for the district and its implementation, in conjunction with local people. He was involved in this for 17 years during which he earned his income primarily out of repairing bicycles, pump sets, tractors, and electric motors in the district. Dunu led a highly disciplined life. Getting up at 5 o’clock in the morning he would wash last night’s utensils. Then he would light the “chulha” and cook lunch – rice, lentil and a vegetable. After that he would cook breakfast and make tea. As the tea got ready he would sing loudly to wake his other young colleagues. He would reply to dozens of letters every day, work for several hours in the workshop, and still find time to read books and discuss issues with his colleagues and the students who came to help with the surveys and research work. Discussions with Dunu and his colleagues helped many students to both understand society as well what could be their potential contributions to change.",
      "It is in the Shahdol Group that Dunu and his co-workers got a glimpse of what the future might hold. Their studies showed that knowledge is power; that most conflicts in society were an attempt to control resources – land, minerals etc. They put together a framework that could be used by the people to analyze problems and come up with solutions, developed over almost two decades in the two studies on Environmental Planning and Environmental Education. It was a powerful participatory mechanism and people put it to a variety of uses, not only in Shahdol but also in other parts of India. As described by Roy:",
      "“We learned that people can fight for their survival based on what knowledge they can create. Each one of the reports and studies cited above and numerous others, that we helped produce, indicates that ordinary working people have the capacity to learn, to collect information, to look at it analytically, and eventually use it for bettering their own lives. And that is our goal and that should be the objective of education.”",
      "Unfinished Business",
      "After about 20 years Dunu moved to JNU, New Delhi where his wife Dr. Imrana Qadeer was a Professor at the Center of Social and Preventive Medicine. Imrana comes from an erudite family of scientists and scholars and is a known expert in the field of community medicine. She too left her Registrar-ship at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to teach at JNU. Their son Ishan studied design at the National Institute of Design (NID) Ahmedabad and is now teaching at the Genesis School in NOIDA. They have a daughter Devi who is currently in school and aspires to be a psychologist (although occasionally she also wants to be a professional assassin!).",
      "In Delhi Dunu did a brief stint with the World Wide Fund for Nature. There, he created a low-cost cell to monitor the effects of pollution on habitat and to build a bridge between the workers in industry (where pollution is created and has the maximum harm) and the farmers in the hinterland (who are officially the impacted people). “They shunted me out after four years, when my work started upsetting the companies that funded them,” he says candidly.",
      "He then set up the Delhi-based Hazards Centre, a research group that “helps communities and organizations to understand and deal with anything that’s dangerous to their survival”. It works with marginalized groups all over India, mainly in urban areas now, helping them face challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. The Centre also gets 20-30 student interns every year from the IITs and other premier institutes. The Centre helps these students to understand how the other half lives, struggles, or dies.",
      "In Gujarat, his small group of researchers assisted communities in making claims under the Tribal Rights Act; in Patna, they provided information to women’s groups in slums to enable them to lay claim to water, sanitation, and other services; in Visakhapatnam, they strengthened squatter groups to obtain proper resettlement from the railways; in Singrauli, they are giving technical expertise to citizens’ groups challenging the environmental degradation by thermal plants; in Hyderabad, they supplied designs for people’s critical analysis of urban renewal projects; in Bhubaneswar, they are helping vendors’ associations to understand the Vendor Act and Policy; in Delhi, they are guiding groups of waste-pickers, rickshaw-pullers, daily workers, and vegetable sellers in conducting studies that will provide them with entitlements under the Master Plan; and in Uttarakhand and Himachal, they are developing critiques of hydro-electric generation projects and their impacts on the local population.",
      "More than anyone else in the country Dunu has been an aspiring mentor to several generations of IITians and students from many professional colleges and institutions – prodding them like Socrates to question the mainstream parameters of success, to challenge the accepted “should”, and conduct a more “examined” life. He has encouraged them to explore how their education can be put to socially meaningful use; how their M Phils and PhDs are more relevant for the people; and how research can have an objective that is greater than the acquisition of degrees and academic positions.",
      "Purpose of Education",
      "“The purpose of education should be to develop the capacity to learn, to collect information, to look at it analytically, and eventually use it for bettering lives. Instead, we have didactic instruction, memorizing by rote, and vomiting out useless information for futile examinations that constitute the fundamentals of what passes for education in our schools and colleges.”",
      "To the outsider, it seems like Dunu has drifted a long way from his engineering days at IIT. “Not at all,” protests Dunu. “The IITs were meant to create solutions to national problems, which is why they were called Institutes of Technology and not Institutes of Engineering and Management, which is what they have become today. I am still very much an engineer, but I link the profession with an understanding of the politics of society and the imperatives of ecology.”",
      "Does he think the film 3 Idiots is indicative of the changing attitude towards engineering? “Yes and no,” he says, after thinking for a moment. Dunu admits that the film raised questions about an engineering education, but believes that the answer it provided was flawed.",
      "“It basically said you could succeed in professions like photography or music despite your engineering degree; but it never answered the real question –how do you make engineering relevant”",

      "The educational terrain in India, especially for poor children, is very harsh – almost barren. Even a good seed will wilt away in the absence of any soil to nurture it. We should endeavor to prepare a fistful of soil every day to help these seeds germinate. Therein lies hope and this will lend meaning to our lives.",
      "After graduating from IIT Kanpur in 1975, Arvind Gupta took up a job with Telco, Pune, now Tata Motors, as an engineer trainee. Two years later he realized that he was not born to make trucks. There were too many questions plaguing him. “Why do people who toil the hardest, do the most back breaking work get paid the least? Why was the education system so rotten? Why did the poor have no access to quality education?” He wanted to experience life, participate in the struggle of workers, and instead of seeing the scorching headlights of trucks he wanted to see a gleam in the eyes of children – the joy of learning something new!",
      "In 1980 when Arvind quit his job at Telco, his mother came to his defense stating, “Good, now that he has quit his job he will do something worthwhile”.",
      "A prophetic statement from a woman who herself never went to school.  But she ensured that her four children went to the best school and excelled. Arvind has not disappointed his mother.  Every day he has worked with children – perhaps learnt more from them than he has taught. For the last 30-years, he has been demystifying and popularizing science among children with toys from trash thus preparing the fertile soil which will one day nurture young minds to germinate into eager, creative, exploring, questioning adults.",
      "Inspiration",
      "In 1972 a lecture at IITK by Dr. Anil Sadgopal recounting his experiences of teaching science to village children in Madhya Pradesh stirred him deeply. Dr. Sadgopal did a PhD from Caltech and worked as a microbiologist with the TIFR. He was barely thirty when he quit his job to start Kishore Bharati – one of the first NGO’s in the Hoshangabad District of Madhya Pradesh. He was disgusted by the horrendous way science was taught in village schools. The Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme (HSTP) attempted to make science interesting for village kids who had no access to expensive labs. Arvind looked at the possibilities of designing simple fun experiments using easily available local, low-cost materials like matchboxes, coins, broom sticks, newspapers, cycle tubes, old electric bulbs, rubber slippers etc. This excited Arvind enormously. In 1978, he took one year off from Telco and worked with the HSTP. There he designed many appropriate teaching aids. One was the Matchstick Mecanno which used cycle valve tube and ordinary matchsticks to make a series of 2 and 3-dimensional structures.",
      "Another person that inspired him was Laurie Baker, a British-born Indian architect, renowned for his work on cost-effective energy-efficient houses. Arvind calls him,”my college day icon.” As a very compassionate architect, Laurie Baker touched the lives of the poor. He used local materials, local designs to build very affordable houses for the poorest fishermen. In 1978, Arvind spent four splendid months working with this great man and learnt that the solution to problems of the poor can be found by delving deeper into their reality – by understanding local materials, designs and skills. Arvind recalls, “Baker was an amazing man – all the time joking, laughing, drawing cartoons making fun of himself and the world around him, but simultaneously doing dead serious work.”",
      "George Washington Carver – the black scientist’s life and work also deeply inspired him. Born a slave he struggled hard against racism and worked for the good of all humanity",
      "Finally in 1980, Arvind left Telco to pursue his passion. He joined theVidushak Karkhana– a commune run by a group of socially sensitized IITians (Dunu Roy, Sudhindra Seshadri and Sanjeev Ghotge) in the tribal district of Shahdol. There the inmates lived a Spartan life – cooked and worked collectively, ran a mechanical workshop, and dissected and discussed the whole world. Here the “personal became political” and he was able to explore some of his deepest queries.",
      "From 1981-83, he worked with a trade union of miners in Chattisgarh. To him, terms like ‘contract workers’ and ‘exploitation’ were mere words, bereft of any deep meaning. He thought of experiencing the life of the marginalized to make sense and understand them better. The three years were tough but deeply enriching. Many times the only meal was rice with salt; and bed was the union office floor. He brought out the union’s newspaper “Mitan” – and sold it on the mine gates. He also helped the union run a garage for repairing trucks and taught in their schools. Through this he gained first-hand experience of the deep struggle in the lives of the poor. The mining township had 300 dump trucks ferrying ore from the mines to the railway yard. Children of the miners were very creative. They made improvised dump-trucks using just two matchboxes. They used a matchstick lever to lift the loading platform of their trucks. This was his first insight into the amazing world of children’s creativity. He documented this Matchbox Dump Truck in his first book – “Matchstick Models & other Science Experiments”.",
      "Beginnings….",
      "Arvind was born in 1953, one of four children whose parents had never been to school. His father – a poor businessman was perpetually in debt. He greatly benefited from his mother’s wisdom. She gave him enormous self-esteem and high self-worth. His mother understood the value of education and made sure that all her four children attended the best English Convent in Bareilly (UP) – St. Maria Goretti School. When debts mounted she sold her jewelry to pay for the children’s school expenses. Arvind still remembers his math teacher, Mrs. Frey. “She was the best. She nudged us gently to relate things to real life. She realized that I was good in math but poor in English. So, she chatted with me for hours in English.  Because of her generosity I excelled in English and passed with distinctions.” As a child he didn’t have many bought out toys. In a sense this was a blessing – because now he had to improvise his own toys. When he was 6 years old a relative gifted him a Mecanno Set – which had steel strips with holes, screws and pulleys. He played with it for years and made many more things than were listed in the brochure.",
      "Arvind did well in school and topped his district in the Intermediate Board Exams. After 12thhe got into IIT with an AIR of 218. He was 28thin the North Zone. Which branch of engineering to choose? He had no clue. So he asked all the 27 boys ahead of him as they returned after counseling. All had opted for Electrical. So he landed up doing Electrical Engineering.",
      "The Time & the Place: IITK and the 70’s",
      "Coming from a poor family and small town, IITK opened up a new magical world for him. The swanky infrastructure, astounding facilities, enlightened faculty and elite peer group did sometimes instill a sense of awe. But there were great opportunities to be seized.",
      "Together with his friend Akhilesh Agarwal he did a lot of tinkering – they made a compressed air engine, a Wankle Engine and repaired numerous aero-modeling engines. For full three years both of them ran the aero-modeling and auto-club at IITK.",
      "As a child Arvind read little. IITK made up for it. The best thing at IITK was the library. It opened from 8 AM to midnight and one could issue 10 books. He used to read a lot – 6 newspapers every single day! He got addicted to theEconomic & Political Weekly(EPW) and voraciously lapped up theCalcutta Diaryby Ashok Mitra. This helped him see his own experiences in a perspective. All 5-years, he got the merit-cum-means scholarship. So, it was cheaper for his parents to keep him at IITK, than at home! This meant he spent a lot of time at IITK even in holidays.",
      "The 1970’s were politically very volatile years. Students were out on the streets of Paris challenging authority. Anti-Vietnam, civil rights movements were rattling America. Rachel Carson’s bookSilent Springushered in the environment movement. Intellectuals were swearing not to participate in war research. There was revolution in the air.",
      "Arvind was drawn to political activism right in his first year. The Director had suspended Prof. A. P. Shukla – a distinguished physicist from Princeton for his left-leaning activism with theKaramchari Sangh. In protest the students decided to take out a march. He decided to join in. He was perhaps the youngest amongst the protesters. The rest were all MTech and PhD students. There were hardly any BTech’s. Students marched from one hostel to another. Some protestors carried placards and banners. As a young novice he was the only one shouting, “Comrades come out! Protest!” Some of the PG students got jittery at the word ‘comrade’ and asked him to shut up. He was too naive to understand the political ramifications of ‘comrade’. To him it simply meant a friend. The march ended by pissing in front of the Director’s House! This was Arvind’s first explicit political act!",
      "A few intellectuals in IITK in 70’s were sympathetic to the Naxalite movement. They endlessly discussed the ideology of ‘class conflict’ and ‘seizure of state power’ over umpteen cups of coffee andCharminars.",
      "Such empty talk didn’t attract him. They sounded vain. “Why don’t they do something about the plight of the mess servants?” Arvind would ask, “They serve us from early morning till late at night. Still their children don’t get admission in either the elite Campus School or the Central School.” Some of his class mates placed more faith in small positive action than in empty rhetoric. They were doers. So, he joined a group called SAHYOG – which helped teach the children of the mess servants.",
      "They went from room-to-room collecting Rs 5/- per month pleading with hostel mates to “help a poor child go to school”. Some people were kind and paid. Others slammed the door on their faces and threw them out. He taught for a long time in the Opportunity School – a makeshift school for the underprivileged run in a Type II quarter.",
      "In TA-204 Arvind and Akhilesh swore not to make a ‘silly’ project which would gather dust and ultimately mingle into rust. So they decided to do something ‘socially useful’ for the community. So, they made a ‘see-saw’ for the Opportunity School. They got the kids to doShramdan. They dug two pits and finally grouted the ‘see-saw’ in place. Once a week he used to bunk classes to teach in the Opportunity School. They also held evening tutorials – helping children with difficult concepts or their homework. He spent the last 3-years in Hall V where he taught at least a dozen children from the Nankari village. They finally cleared their High School Exams.",
      "Around 1970 Dr. Man Mohan Choudhary started theLe Montage– a film club. In five years the films club screened just about every film by Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, de Sica and Satyajit Ray. ‘Wages of Fear’ and ‘The Bicycle Thief’ was screened at least thrice. The student’s saw the world’s best cinema and listened to the country’s best musicians. All this had a profound effect on his sensibilities! There were extra-mural lectures by luminaries – Dr. Anil Sadgopal, Noble Laureate Gunnar Myrdal and Hindi writer Bhishma Sahni.",
      "Arvind recalls, “A good institute does something to you without you knowing it. It slowly creeps and seeps under your skin – every pore of it. And that is what IITK did to me – it shaped my thinking, my character and prodded me to do something worthwhile than just make money.”",
      "His first semester English teacher was the very enlightened Prof. Suzie Tharu andThe Little Princewas his text book! The many social science courses – Philosophy, Political Science, and Economics challenged him to view issues from different angles – to look beyond the narrow ‘technical’ viewpoint. IITK certainly gave him a holistic perspective.",
      "The defining political slogan of the seventies was:",
      "“Go to the people, Live with them, love them,",
      "Start from what they know. Build on what they have.”",
      "Mission – to get the gleam back into a child’s eyes",
      "Arvind has attempted to put the joy back into learning science. He has designed 1000 low-cost teaching aids and toys for learning science. These activities have been documented in clear sequential photographs with crisp instructions into books and videos. His team has also made 470 short films (1-2 minute duration) on how to make these learning aids. These films dubbed in 18 languages show the whole process of making and playing with the toy. Currently he has 3400 short films on YouTube with over 40,000 viewers every day. In the last four years these films have been viewed over 15-million times. Friends and volunteers help in dubbing these films in many world languages. When children see a film in their local language it makes a lot more sense to them. All this educational material can be downloaded freely from his websitehttp://arvindguptatoys.com/",
      "Over the years he has translated hundreds of books on education, peace, science, mathematics and great children’s literature into Hindi. He has also presented over 145 films for the NCERT science programme titledTarang. These films have been repeatedly beamed onDoordarshan. He has conducted workshops in over 2,500 schools across the country – many of them with municipal and poor schools. This is how he describes his experience after each workshop, “After every workshop I see smiles on the faces of the children. There is gleam in their eyes. These have been my most fulfilling moments. I see hope.”",
      "To reach far flung remote Indian villages with little internet connectivity a DVD titledTheLearner’s Libraryhas been collated. It contains 1000 amazing E-Books on Education, Peace, Environment, Science, Mathematics and great Children’s Books plus 220 short videos on Toys-from-Trash plus 6000 photographs with instructions to make simple science models. All this is packed in a single DVD! This DVD (currently in Marathi, Hindi and English) has been shared with over 7000 schools for free. Apart from this, every week Arvind’s team holds two free science workshops for school children. In each workshop 50 children from a municipal school participate. They spend 4-hours seeing some amazing science demonstrations and also make 10 simple science models with their own hands. The children take back what they make.",
      "In 2003, Prof. Jayant Narlikar (Padma Vibhushan) India’s most celebrated Astrophysicist invited Arvind to work at the Children’s Science Center of IUCAA (Inter-University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics) located in Pune. Here, a small team of four – verypassionate and wonderful people work out of a 400-sq ft room. Surrounded by junk, the 59-year-old Arvind, in his corduroys andkhadi kurta, walks around barefoot, creating teaching aids which he lovingly call “toys”. Gupta’s office/lab is littered with finds from the local bazaar, garbage cans, old bottles etc. There are broken CDs, used Tetrapaks, bicycle valves and tubes, film rolls, magnets, plastic straws, used refills of ballpoint pens, all types of paper, worn-out bathroom slippers, matchsticks and matchboxes, mirrors, bangles and combs. Hanging from soft-boards, wall nails, doorknobs and handles are Tetrapak butterflies, needle and thread acrobats, paper birds, spiders and skeletons.",
      "Everyday 10,000 passionate books are downloaded from his website. All for free. His reward: a sense of deep gratitude to be able to do something meaningful for the poorest children of the world. The Science Center’s mission statement is – “Get the gleam back into a child’s eyes.”",
      "He believes in Copyleft NOT Copyright",
      "There are 400-million Hindi-speaking people who have little access to good reading material. There is a tremendous paucity of good books in Hindi. With over a billion people there are no decent public libraries in India. One of his passions has been to translate good books for children in Hindi. Every day he spends three hours translating books into Hindi so that they can reach out to a larger section of children.",
      "In 1998, the Pokhran blast shook his conscience. The response to these nuclear tests was uniformly eulogistic. Politicians across the board lauded this feat.  Indian scientists vied for photographs dressed in military fatigues. This was deeply depressing for Arvind.  He looked around and there seemed to be no books on peace in India – the land of Buddha and Gandhi. It was then that he came across a Japanese story called ‘Sadako and the Thousand Cranes’– a true story about a girl named Sadako Sasaki, who was diagnosed with leukemia after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Sadako knew about the Japanese legend that folding a 1000 paper cranes would grant her wish. She did fold a few hundred cranes but ultimately succumbed to the atom bomb disease. Sadako died at twelve for no fault of hers. This story brought tears to Arvind’s eyes. He knew he had to translate it. There are now a dozen anti-war books, amongst hundreds of other translated titles on his website. “Our focus is to make valuable world literature available to our children in Hindi,” says Gupta.",
      "Lokmanya Tilak said, ”Swaraj is my birthright, and I will have it.” Arvind has similar views on the sharing of knowledge. He says, “Knowledge is my birthright, and I will share it. Copyrights laws were enacted in the caveman’s era – they make little sense in today’s digital world. The digital dream should be to bring every book, in every language available to every child on earth for free. And this is very doable.” He has digitizing thousands of out of print books on education and for children. He has been translating books that help children see new possibilities and expand their horizons. He claims, “The need to share knowledge is enormous. The response of civil society should be toshare. Not for money, but for theloveof sharing. Whatever I do is a small effort towards doing just that.”",
      "Science is not about burettes or pipettes",
      "Having visited more than 2,500 schools, Gupta observed that in most schools the lab apparatus lay locked in cupboards and gathered dust. It is a myth that science can only be done in fancy labs with gleaming glass burettes and pipettes. Science has been made out to be a bookish affair in which you simply mug up definitions and formulae and spit them out in exams. But this is patently untrue.",
      "For children, the whole world is a laboratory – they are always making things. Children are often traumatized by expensive equipment alienated from their own daily life. His slogan is, “The best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.”",
      "Why do children break toys? Because they are curious and want to know what’s inside it. This is what propels them.  A well designed toy must welcome children to pull it apart, see its innards and put it back again. There is enormous possibility and potential in our children, if they are given a chance to discover things for themselves. “When children make things themselves, they gain a deep insight. They learn so much without being taught. For instance, the newspaper has a grain in one specific direction. Long strips can only be torn along the grain, not across it,”",
      "The British Telcom ad sums the deadness of schools succinctly. “Children walk to school, children run away from school.” If we can link science to real life and real objects than it becomes magical. On Arvind’s website, one can find, for instance, a delightful centrifugal pump made from a drinking straw, a piece of a bicycle spoke and some sticky tape. Another is a totally unbelievable way of balancing ten nails on the head of a single vertical nail, which can be rocked. The nice thing about these toys is that they are made from absolutely low cost, locally available materials, with a strong recycling element.",
      "We must not forget that most sacred and expensive thing in any “lab” is the child’s mind! Toys capture children’s imagination, teach them scientific principles, and encourage their curiosity. Toys from trash imbue another cardinal value TO DO MORE WITH LESS.",
      "We need engineers to help those living on the ground",
      "To encourage IITians to take up social causes, he suggests that first and second year students should spend a couple of days living in a city-slum or with a remote village community. This will directly expose them to conditions of depravity and dehumanization. Compassion and consciousness for the poor can come only through direct personal experience and not through lectures on poverty. These real experiences will make youngsters think, analyze and they will soon discover for themselves the real reasons for world poverty. Some of them will later on certainly take up more meaningful vocations then working for the war industry or destructive corporations. Arvind’s inspiration is a Young Oxfam Poster of the seventies:",

      "I have now realized that happiness does not depend on CPI. There are many other things which affect happiness in life – health, relationship with spouse, kids, parents, friends and neighbors to name a few.",
      "During B. Tech. days many of my classmates were extremely worried about their CPI. For many it was the only wayto ensure access",
      "to American universities and most importantly the scholarships there. I never had those aspirations and possibly because of that I never felt that type of pressure at anytime during B. Tech. program.",
      "",
      "This doesn’t mean that I did not want to do well; I just couldn’t help it.  It was quite frustrating for me.  However, after so many years I have become wise enough to realize that life does not depend so much on CPI. There are many other things which affect happiness in life – health, relationship with spouse, kids, parents, friends and neighbors to name a few.",
      "",
      "Honestly speaking, I did struggle with my CPI during B. Tech. which I passed out in 1989. It was in electrical engineering and my passing out CPI was 7.1. Am I a “success” story? I do not know. I consider myself to be a work-in-progress. I am still struggling (though I am doing reasonably well)   and trying to build my entrepreneurial business. I believe in efforts. Hopefully the result will take care of itself.",
      "",
      "Humble beginnings",
      "",
      "Before I talk about my views on CPI let me talk about myself first. I was born and brought up in a very small tribal village at a remote location in Jharkhand. My village had no electricity and the nearest all weather road was approximately 10 km away. In the absence of any public transport we had to either walk or ride on bicycle to go to the nearest small town, a block headquarter, and then catch a bus to go to Ranchi, Gumla or Lohardaga. During rainy season it was almost impossible to ride even on a motor bike. During these days even getting any medical help from nearby town used to be a project in itself. Because of lack of hygiene in our daily life, we used to get sick quite often and many a times our grandparents believed on the local “Ojha” (tantric) will cure us. Luckily my father was an educated man and believed more on modern medical care.",
      "",
      "I started studying a bit late (about 6 or 7 years of age) that too at home. My grandfather had arranged one teacher of nearby village school to come to our house regularly and teach us. After fair bit of teaching I was admitted to a school of nearby village in class 4. The school was approximately 1.5 Km away and we used to sit on the floor on our jute sacks and were taught by teachers who used to do part time farming.",
      "",
      "When I was about 11 years old my uncle took me with him so that I can study in town. He was a lecturer in Bhagalpur University. My secondary school education was completed there. By this time I had proven myself to be a good student.  I used to feel good at school because of all the recognition that I got for being a good and sincere student. However, I must admit, I did not quite enjoy the normal family and social life very much because of being away from my parents for a long time. I had clearly missed the parental love and guidance during those formative years.",
      "",
      "My higher secondary education was done partly at Bhagalpur and then at Ranchi. At Ranchi I came in contact with some really good friends who helped me in preparing for JEE. I did not take any conventional coaching classes but relied on books suggested by my friends. However I could manage to get good AIR ranking securing a seat in Electrical Engineering B. Tech program at IIT Kanpur. Thanks to my friends Rajesh Ranjan and Manoj Roy for extraordinary help without which I could not have cracked JEE.",
      "",
      "I had good AIR. I tried, but could not get A’s in courses at IITK",
      "",
      "Now I was at IIT Kanpur, a shy person with no confidence to engage in good conversation in English and used to feel a bit awkward in many social occasions. Clearly my confidence was at its lowest which was compounded by just enough monetary support from my parents. Thanks to the Merit-Cum-Means scholarship which provided me extra support. I do not know what I would have done without it.",
      "",
      "I tried as much as I could but could not get A’s. I had to contend with B’s, C’s and sometimes D’s.",
      "",
      "The reasons for this are my failure in getting fully engaged during classes and, I must admit, not being able to comprehend many things being taught in classes due to poor listening comprehension in English in first two semesters. This was also because of my inability to interact and have conversation with my peers coming from different backgrounds which must have limited my ability to learn from them. Thirdly I used to take sports sincerely which, after so much of study, left very little time for social interactions.",
      "",
      "Depression hit me once, but not because of bad grades",
      "",
      "I used to get disappointed with my bad grades. Fortunately, I had no pressure from my family nor did I have ambition to go to US. I just wanted to do well in study and expected good grades.",
      "",
      "However, I recall certain moments of my life in campus when I was really depressed. One such moment was in third year when my mother passed away after a long battle with cancer. The thoughts I had that time were that of despondency. I think some of my instructors did notice this and one of the Deans, Prof Raghuram, did have very sympathetic words with me. However, after those few moments of good words it was the same old harsh world again expecting me to show the similar performance as was expected had this bad event had not taken place.",
      "",
      "I was able to handle this myself because of the strong value system that I had due to moral teachings and parental guidance. (I believed that whatever God does is for one’s good. One should do one’s best but should not have high expectations about its results.)",
      "",
      "When I reflect about this incident and about similar moments of my life, I think my faith in the strong value system which was developed due to my growing up in traditional Indian society had helped to recover from those moments of sadness and melancholy.",
      "",
      "The second incident that I recall is when I was in 2nd year and I could not appear in two end-semester exams because of illness. Thereafter, I was asked to reappear.   I failed in one of them. This was for TA (Technical Arts-2). The reason was the nature of the exam. In this exam the expected answers were supposed to be somehow mugged up to be reproduced during the exams. I thought it was so un-IIT like. Students used to guess the likely questions for mugging up the answers   and my guess turned out to be wrong. The instructor was also unforgiving. Due to this I had to repeat this course with junior students which I did not like at all and at times felt sad.",
      "",
      "In view of this, I suggest that whenever an instructor fails some body it should be reviewed by someone independent and then only the decision to fail should be taken. In fact if students fail in any subject the matter should be investigated by higher authorities and the teaching content, teaching style etc of the instructor should be thoroughly examined.",
      "",
      "One of the reasons that I never felt too depressed was because of my involvement in sports.",
      "",
      "First sporting activity is always a very good stress-buster and so reduces the chances of getting depressed. Secondly my achievement in sports which includes gold medal in inter IIT meet made me well recognized in the institute and possibly because of which I never felt too isolated from others in the institute. Chances of depression are more if someone feels himself/herself isolated from others.",
      "",
      "What is important is to identify your passion and run with it.",
      "",
      "It has been more than 20 years since I graduated. I now realize that I should have paid more attention to developing soft skills e.g. conversational skills, relationship building, people skills etc. instead of CPI.",
      "",
      "Many graduates do not pursue engineering as profession and extra effort put in by them at IITK to get high CPI, while neglecting to develop life skills, is a wasted effort.  The fact that CPI is not very important should be instilled in the mind of these young students, their parents and the faculty.",
      "",
      "High CPI, may indicate that the person is goal oriented. However, low CPI does not necessarily mean that the person is not goal oriented or that he cannot become a successful person later on. I was goal oriented but my CPI was low because of intense competition and various other reasons. What is important is to identify your passion and run with it.",
      "",
      "I think IITK should emphasize the importance of developing of soft skillsamong students. These are the skills a person will find very useful no matter what profession he/she chooses after getting engineering degree. The academic institutes should realize that they are not making students just an engineer but as fully developed human being who can learn whatever hard subject he is needed in course of his/her professional life. There is no need to force them to learn something which they may not utilize in their life later on. There is no need to teach heavy curriculum. The purpose of teaching should be to make students aware of concepts. If any student later on pursues career in engineering he can always do self-study to better his professional engineering skills. The campus should cultivate happy learning environment with emphasis on creativity and innovation.",
      "",
      "Sneak out and experience “life”",
      "",
      "I would say there should be more social activities, sports activities, and cultural activities in campus. The time for these activities should be provided by reducing some curriculum related stuff. I suggest frequent arranging of cross country races and other sports activities which enjoy wider participation. To facilitate social mixing occasional group lunches, easy seminars could be organized more frequently. IITK campus is isolated from the city. There should be more efforts to make sure that these young students go to the city/outside campus. Group visits to nearby parks, zoos, cinemas should be done frequently.  In short I suggest that the students should be encouraged to be part of the community, to have friends, to be engaged in sporting and social activities and the curriculum should be reduced to make sure that they have enough time for all these things.",
      "",
      "IITD has the lowest suicide rates which I feel is because of the fact that it is not geographically isolated from the city which provides more opportunity for students to sneak out of campus and experience the life outside. IITD courses are also not heavy. In spite of this its students are no less capable or less successful.——",

      "All my friendsare going to USA. I must join the ratrace. But heart wantshappiness in India among family, friends and the people who are like me. Head wants money – without which there is little security. Will my journey to USA bring happiness? Will money be answer to my prayers? Will I finally realize that true joy is in the sense of belonging?",
      "I am Vivek Kumar Singh, Class of 1996 B.Tech. from IIT Kanpur and this is my story.",
      "It is more than an autobiography. It is the story of millions of Indian youths, who enter the job market each year, with an overpowering ambition to succeed and make money. They run in every possible direction to grab money – perhaps the only indicator of success in their eyes. Mid-way through the pursuit of money, they lose focus or rather gain focus and think about the purpose of all the running around behind mega bucks. They realize that there is more to a blissful journey than money. “Is this I want to do for the rest of my life or there is something else?” The question starts haunting their minds. However, materialistic urges and fear of the unknown, keeps them trapped in the vicious cycle.Sometimes, it is sheer pressure – to do what everyone else is doing – that holds them on the dreaded path, also known as the “rat race”.",
      "Brain creates fear psychosis. It keeps sending stimulus to tell, “If money is lost, comfort will be lost. You will become nobody. Keep garnering cash. Do not digress or you will be a loser.”",
      "Heart’s rumblings are often ignored by the brain. However, if the heart is strong enough, brain will concede and look for a middle path (commonly called compromise). Alignment of heart and head is a must for a contended journey of life. An emotional heart and rational brain will figure out a middle path, which satisfies both.",
      "More often than not, head and heart are in a fight for supremacy. We are torn between what ‘we want to do’ and what ‘we are supposed to do.’",
      "Initially, my head conquered my heart. Finally, the heart won the battle and I am now back home in India with no regrets. I do not want to preach you anything. I just want to share my journey of struggle between the head and the heart; most common in every life. There is no one fixed answer that one must choose. The ultimate goal is living with oneself and be happy. And there are as many ways to be happy as there are to be unhappy. I hope you will choose to be happy; regardless of your past decisions & choices.",
      "Beginnings…",
      "I was born in a middle-class, educated family in Bihar. My father’s salary was the only source of income for the family. He was a UGC commissioned lecturer – least corrupt but most demanding job. My mother was also a lecturer in a private college, which never paid any salary, ever. She continued with the hope that sooner or later government would overtake the college and regularize it and she would get the arrears due. She retired with that hope. My siblings and I had to wait until the end of each month to buy any personal items – till father’s pay check. Still we felt loved and pampered. My mother was very strict with our studies. She knew that good education is bread and butter for middle-class. We used to study with kerosene lamps. Electricity was rarely available.",
      "My family was proud when I was selected for a prestigious residential school, situated at south Bihar, now Jharkand, called Neterhat. I was among sixty selected for my batch from all over Bihar and Jharkand. I was twelve years old. I learned the pain of separation with family at an early age. It was a boys’ school, only exception was teachers’ daughters. Teachers also used to live in the school campus. I spent next five years at Neterhat, achieving adolescence, learning discipline, and understanding the meaning of friendship. After 5 years in Netherhat, I completed Intermediate with Science and Math and appeared for IIT JEE exam – the only way for a middle-class student to get decent education as we could not afford to attend high-fee charging private engineering colleges. With a bit (or lot ?) of luck and great deal of hard work, I cleared JEE and chose IIT Kanpur.",
      "Neither a Dude nor a Desi",
      "America was very much alive at IITK. There was a group of students who knew more about America and the American way of life than about the country of their origin. This group was called DUDE. Snobbery and arrogance were considered interweaving threads of this Dude group. Another name for this group of students was  Dropped. The logic behind this name was that God was sending these people to USA but accidentally dropped them at IITK. The not so-elite group of mostly Hindi speaking students was called ‘Brahmin Boy’, ‘punter’, anddesi. These two groups were always at loggerheads. Fortunately, I was neither adesinor a dude; I was in the good books of both groups. Reason being, I did not have strong preferences for any language, culture, region or other related things.",
      "Those four years at IITK went off like sitting next to a beautiful and talkative lady. There were a lot of memorable moments. During ragging, I was asked to propose a girl in Hindi and say exact translation of words “Hello Sexy, Would you like to go on date with me” .. Another instance in which, a department topper tattooed initials of his crush in Blood on his arms and still got rejected by the girl. The evergreen fights and squabble between Desi Vs Dudes were always interesting and didn’t let you get bored. And then continuous classes and activities. It seemed that destination came fast and we had to get off. But there were  some brave-hearts, who continued for their college journey for another couple of years by flunking some courses. It seemed a big deal that time, but they might not be repenting now. In 80 years of lifespan and a career of 50 yrs, 1 or 2 years hardly makes a difference, so a bit of extra fun is OK. I am of the opinion that spending extra time in college is always good. Friends from earlier part of life become support for the later part of life. Earn as many friends as you can.",
      "So, with some broken hearts, rationality overtaking infatuation, we graduated and most of us took software jobs without actually knowing what software was. We shrugged off the warnings of our esteemed faculty – “In software, you will be dead meat in ten years.”",
      "Bangalore — a Mecca for a College Graduate from Kanpur",
      "I got job in a reputed Indian software company in Bangalore. Bangalore has fabulous weather and equally fabulous pubs. For the next two years Bangalore was my home. I had everything in Bangalore – a salary that was ten times more than the pocket money, pubs, free weekends, lots of college friends who like me landed in Bangalore, free internet in office and email-id. Those days internet and e-mail were privileges. We were in constant touch with our friends who went to US for higher studies.",
      "I was making as much salary as my father was getting and he had just five years left to retire. When I told him my salary, he was so concerned with the higher wages of the software industry that he wanted to write to my company to reduce wages for software engineers. His argument was that so much money in young hands would lead to various social evils. My father used say, “Have lust for life, not for money.” However, slowly, money started playing mind games with me. A year later, I started feeling that what I was making was not enough. I was getting restless for more. Easiest way out was to go overseas, particularly America – where green bucks were flowing for the software industry. Lot of young engineers were leaving Indian companies through placement agencies (derogatorily calleddalals) and taking up jobs in American companies. Money played the central role but ‘exposure to cutting-edge technology’ quoted as an alibi for going abroad. I was now getting bored in my job so I began toying with the idea of going to USA and multiply my salary many times. Bangalore also ceased to give fresh kick. Friend circle was shrinking. Many have left for USA.",
      "The time was right and I had enough reasons to convince that going to USA was necessary. I reasoned, many Indian software companies work for foreign clients. Very few companies work for Indian clients. Therefore, whether you work in India or abroad, you end up working for foreign clients – mostly Americans. “So why not work where there is more money,” my brain has now convinced me that there is nothing wrong in going to America and making more money. Looking back, I find it interesting that when I was at IITK, I never prepared for GRE or GMAT kind of exams which were a must for going abroad. I had, in fact, observed the lives of foreign students at IITK who were highly alienated from most of us. I did not want to live like them in a foreign land myself. But now I had found enough reasons to convince myself that going to America is what I need to do. Mind is a powerful thing!",
      "Pilgrimage to America for a better life?",
      "With the receipt of visa papers from the consulting company, my pilgrimage to USA started.I took overnight train to Chennai and was in Visa queue by 5 AM. By that time, three aspirants had already beaten me! After being in queue for couple of hours I started thinking, is it really worth it? Finally, I went in and after waiting almost the entire day, I was one of the lucky ones who got visa. The journey back to Bangalore became more scenic. As my days to leave Bangalore approached, it started looking better. Idli, Sambar, Kesri bhat started tasting better. MG Road girls became slimmer and prettier. I sent my first resignation letter. I spent rest of the time in Bihar and Delhi.",
      "From Delhi, I took the first flight of my life to USA in mid-May. My elder brother came to see me off. He did not say anything. But I could sense he was proud of me. There were many Indians in the plane on the Delhi to Frankfurt leg. In fact, vegetarian Indian food was served during this segment. I was very comfortable. But the second stretch from Frankfurt to New York was different. There were few Indians. Suddenly I was an ethnic minority. The minority is skeptical of everything because of a feeling of not belonging. Even the best of intentions of the larger group may be viewed with suspicion. Certainly, I was not one of them. I, however, found comfort in the fact that America is supportive of immigrants. Immigrants – European, African, Spanish, and now Asians, have built America. America has a pluralistic society and the rule of law prevails. And soon I was going to be a part of it. I was sitting next to the window and trying to take in and memorize everything my eyes saw. These eyes could now claim to have seen everything – from dusty, rustic Bihar village to New York City – literally a world apart.",
      "The cab drive from Airport to my hotel via office gave me time to reflect on lots of philosophical questions and compare India to America.",
      "I started working from Monday. I shared a three-bedroom apartment with my college friends. They were employed by another software company. One of them had an American girlfriend. She loved the attention she used to get at Indian gatherings and Desi parties. I got exposed to America and American way of life. I learned a lot about America and the way of thinking of Americans. I liked in America how fun and work can co-exist, Americans’ passion for what they are doing, their work ethics, kids are not taught that their goal is to make parents happy/proud rather to pursue their own dreams, appreciation and support for good work without prejudice, openness to new ideas and willingness to move into uncharted territories, corruption does not affect day to day life of commoners, sincerity of community to find solutions and discuss problems openly, and their love for books. However, something was missing. When you are in America, you miss Indian culture. In India, you miss “the quality of America”. We don’t seem to be happy anywhere.",
      "My life was becoming routine – get up early to go to office and return late. The initial euphoria about residing in America was subsiding. Travel to NY City was getting more frustrating every day. Magnificent buildings, flyovers, bridges, wallet full of plastic cards stopped impressing me. My frequency of calls to India was increasing. I had started feeling lonely. If I was not traveling on weekends, I was on the phone. It was same for my roommates as well. I needed change.",
      "I switched to a New Jersey based company with substantially higher salary and less commute. I attended my school’s (Neterhat’s)  Alumni meet in NJ. I was very comfortable at Edison, NJ. NJ has it all – beaches, casinos, nightlife, farmland, good universities and lots ofdesis! I got opportunities to visitdesifamilies’ social gatherings.  I also found a roommate who was fond of cooking! I realized that as a bachelor, you should be careful of your choice of roommates – they should have girlfriends and love cooking. Then your life will be smooth and interesting. I bought a Jeep Wrangler, learned to drive and got a driving license. With driving license in hand, nothing was unreachable.",
      "India Calling",
      "I spent couple of more years in NJ. I visited India often. The idea of settling down in India was getting dominant. In spite of all the fun and night life, my life in USA was getting listless and lonely. Sitting eight hours in front of computer screen and then at home phone calls to family and friends for another couple of hours was very much how I used to kill my day. Everything looked so lonely, individual and methodical. Looking at the job, culture, society and money separately, I like American way of life. Then what was making me restless or probing me to go back to India? Was I missing the chaos of living in India? I am not sure. I talked about my desire to return to India with my friends. They all gave their own highly rational suggestions. Going back to India became a recurring theme in my head.",
      "I was become restless. Serious accident of my Jeep in which I fortunately survived, even though the jeep got totaled, only added to my resolve. The whole night I thought about the accident – shaken. It could well have been my last working day. I did not want to die in an alien land. Friends consoled saying that, “Don’t worry about what would have happened? It did not happen. It’s over.” But it was not over for me. My friends asked: Why do you want to go back to India to get stuck in the traffic and work for 1/10th of salary to do mundane and perfunctory work? There are so many people and so few avenues in India; it’s so competitive and a dog eats dog world out there. But my counter arguments of offices are lively in India and competition and comparison is a way of life in India and I grew up with that did not seem to convince them. Then I thought of happiness of my family members. Can I really be happy if my family members are not happy? Counter argument came, “Indian society is so intrusive and judgmental at times. They decide what is good for you. It is irritating. In USA, your individualism is intact. No one tells you what to do.” Another friend said, “America is richer, open and meritocratic. What’s wrong in settling here?” I thought for a moment and replied, “Look, my father is not the richest person on earth. But I will not leave him for a richer person. My mother probably is not the most gracious woman on earth. I will not exchange her for another more gracious mother. I am sure my future wife will not be the most beautiful woman on earth. I will not divorce her for a more beautiful woman. Why should I leave India and settle elsewhere? I belong to India.”",
      "My friends were silent. They were looking for an answer, but I got my answer, “I want to go back because I belong to India.” I had found the reason for the void.  I did not belong to USA. The feeling of belonging was missing in USA. It was not a natural habitat for my kind of breed. Adapting to the systems of USA, howsoever perfect they might be, was not natural to me. In USA I felt that I was like a plant being forced to grow in the lab even though the conditions for growth were optimum.",
      "For me growth is not just a biological or chemical process, it is also an emotional process. Emotionally, I would like to grow up where I belong. Regardless of how many years I live in USA, I will always feel a foreigner. I just cannot pretend to fit-in.",
      "Although I felt in peace with my decision, my friends continue to find holes in my argument.  “Do you mean to say that you belong to India because you were born there? If this is the case people will not move from one place to another. Everything will be so static, no exposure to new things.” I argued, “No, people must travel, get exposure to new ideas, improve their current societies. Belonging does not mean any change. I know people who are born in India and lived all along in India but they don’t belong to India. They have been fishing to move out of India.",
      "You belong to a place where your mind and heart aligns not necessarily where you are born and where you have lived.” India is a place where my heart and mind coincides. Both feel comfortable. It spurs me intellectually as well as provides emotional stability.",
      "I am glad I found where I belong. Some people spend their lifetime without being able to make up mind as to where they belong. You can make a short-term compromise on belonging but in long term, it becomes melancholic to live with a feeling of not belonging. I had reached that stage.",
      "I gave 2 months’ notice to my employer. The night before the D-day I spent time talking nonsense with friends. In the morning, I was ready to fly back where I belonged.",

      "My father was a well-known political figure in Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) politics. He was a regular columnist in Hindustan – an influential Hindi daily paper. His editorial articles on political matters of U.P. molded the opinion of important people in New Delhi. My father and Shri Ratan Lal Joshi, the editor of daily Hindustan, were in jail together during 1942 independence movement and were close friends. Shri Joshi was also at one time a close confidant of Mrs. Indira Gandhi. My father was also very close to Shri H. N. Bahuguna who was a popular chief minister of U.P. and a strong candidate for future prime ministership of India. I am not dropping these names to impress upon you my upbringing in a politically well-connected family and my exposure to Indian politics from childhood.  You will see its relevance shortly.",
      "Years and Experiences at IITK",
      "In 2009,  a well known film maker of Mumbai, Shri Sunil Shanbag made video interviewing IIT Kanpur Alumni & former Faculty about their experiences of IITK.The one hour film was released in July 2009 at IIT Kanpur to commemorate its Golden Jubilee celebration and it is a very good watch happenings at IITK during that time. The youtube link  for my interview (20 mins) is athttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK7ZDSRAXYg",
      "Trip to USA",
      "After B.Tech, I got a couple of job offers through placement office; however the desire to go to US was strong. I got admission in several universities but no financial aid. I took admission in M.Tech at IITK and decided to apply for PhD later. During M.Tech, I got interested in solar energy. I was lucky to get Government of India Scholarship for Studies Abroad so I did not have to depend on financial aid from US universities. I chose, University of Florida for PhD in mechanical engineering with specialization in solar energy. When the Air India flight took off at midnight on December 29, 1974, I cried. It was a strange experience for me since I always considered myself to be a strong person but a tremendous love for India– the motherland erupted within me. I vowed that I was going to US to learn about technologies that I could come back and use for India’s benefit. I am amazed even today about how that feeling came but it did come with a tremendous force. There was sadness in leaving my family behind but this overwhelming emotion for India was amazing.",
      "When I landed in University of Florida (UF), I did not know a soul. Fortunately, soon I ran into my batch mate Udai Pratap Singh, who I did not know very well in IITK. He was extremely helpful and offered to have me stay with him till I found my own place and agreed to lend me money till I got my scholarship! As I settled, I started taking all sorts of classes that interested me. I did well in my courses. I was not a genius but a hard worker all my life. The hard work paid off. In one of the courses, the professor gave me 150 marks out of 100 due to my extra effort in solving a problem. I took advantage of the opportunity to attend guest lectures of visiting scholars and engaged with them in discussions. I wanted to soak in as much knowledge as possible. I enjoyed my studies and I also enjoyed the quality of life which was so different at that time from that in India.",
      "During my stay at UF, l was lucky to be able to attend a speech by the then candidate for US Presidency Jimmy Carter and meet with the father of US space program Dr. Wernher Von Braun, distinguished professors of mathematics Dr. Ulam and Dr. Popov, and Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Dr. Eigen. I used to attend their lectures and also invited them in graduate seminars that I used to organize.",
      "It was a great experience learning, listening, and just being in the presence of scholars of such high caliber. I thoroughly enjoyed the rich intellectual life that UF offered.",
      "In collaboration with my IITK classmate Udai Pratap Singh we also launched Indian Students’ Association – organized movie screenings, picnics, and newsletter.",
      "During my PhD, I met Nandini – a graduate student in the department of Agronomy. Nandini was smart, tall, opinionated, determined, and came from a very distinguished Maharashtrian family. What attracted me most to Nandini, besides many other things was our common desire to return to India after studies. Though Nandini was born in Tucson, Arizona, and was a US citizen by birth, she, however, grew up in India and had renounced her US citizenship. We developed liking for each other and in spite of a difference of 4” in height (Nandini is 4” taller than me!) we decided to get married in 1976. Both sets of parents accepted our decision. We got married in Florida – unfortunately neither of our parents could attend the wedding.",
      "After my PhD, I stayed back for about 2 ½ years to teach at UF. This was my opportunity to obtain Green Card but I was against getting it because once I had it, it would have been difficult to go back to India. The university administration was very surprised by my decision and my father called me an idiot.",
      "Normally people were ready to give an arm and a leg to get a Green Card and here I was refusing to apply. We also decided that we will not have children in US even though that meant denying them an opportunity to become US citizens by birth. We desperately wanted to return to India. But then I have always been a foolish and arrogant person!",
      "Why did I return to India?",
      "It has been little more than 30 years since I came back from US. In late 1981 when I returned, few Indians with an IIT background used to come back. Even the ones who did come back went to big cities like Bombay, Delhi, Bangalore etc.",
      "Instead of accepting job offers from IIT Bombay, Tata Energy Research Institute, BHEL, or join Piloo Mody’s Swatantra Party,   I chose to work for rural development and went straight to rural Maharashtra to join hands with Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) founded by my in-laws in Phaltan in 1968. Phaltan was as alien to me as any foreign country since I hardly knew the local language or the milieu; I had mostly spent my life in cities in Northern India. Had I gone crazy? Was I following the Sanskrit adage,Vinash Kale Vipareeta Buddhi– before a person’s downfall, his intelligence and ability to make good decisions fail? I was hung up on doing something useful with my life. Was that such a bad decision?",
      "I came back to India because of my arrogance. I thought, with my father’s political and other connections and with the help of scientists like Dr. Atma Ram I would be able to get involved in the energy and technology scene at the National level. Also the inflated notion about my own ability made me believe that I could help change India. How wrong I was! Instead of me changing India, India changed me. I consider my coming back as the detoxification of Anil Rajvanshi! In fact I thank the higher forces for making me think irrationally so that I left everything to come to rural Maharashtra!",
      "I chose Phaltan because this was the only place I knew at that time where I could do something on my own. Thank God for giving me a place, no matter how small, where I could think deeply on issues of rural development, renewable energy and spirituality, reflect on them and write about them. At the same time remaining connected to the outside world via the Internet allowed me to share my thoughts with like-minded people on a much bigger scale.",
      "My decision of coming back to rural Maharashtra was never dictated by altruistic desire of helping India but was due to the selfish reason of doing something meaningful in my life. The challenge of using technology for rural development was tremendous. However, at that time with the knowledge and wisdom that I had, I never planned for long-term goals. I just crossed the bridges as they came. In fact I have never done any long-term planning and have accepted events as they come.",
      "It was not smooth sailing",
      "Initially, there were many struggles. Very soon after coming back the ground realities hit me and all my romantic notions and arrogance vanished. Those days Phaltan was a very difficult place to live and work in. I and Nandini lived for 2 years in slums of Phaltan in a small rented house. We moved into our present house that I designed in early 1984. It is a comfortable house and has a passive cooling system which is very useful for Phaltan climate. Both of us used to daily bicycle to the Institute – a distance of about 3 kms one way. In 1984 my brother who was going to Saudi Arabia as an orthopedic surgeon took pity on me and gave me his old scooter which he had got in 1975 from Chief Minister’s quota. That was our first motorized vehicle.",
      "Just 6 months after coming back to India, with reality and frustration setting in, I decided to return to USA. So Nandini started packing our household goods. After half an hour of packing I suddenly realized that if I also go back to US then I would become another data point among the millions of Indians who are in US. I asked myself “why am I quitting now when I was so proud of taking a different path?” This was the last time I ever gave a thought to quitting. Though I had to suffer through many trials and tribulations later on, the thought of leaving Phaltan never crossed my mind again.",
      "In those days for purchasing even small things one had to go to Pune – a town 100 kms away. When I came to Phaltan there was a flat piece of land where I was supposed to start building my energy lab. The Institute had a small building with almost no other infrastructure. I got an old fan fitted in my office and that was the only fan in the whole Institute. Besides one rarely had electricity so the fan was mostly non-functional! In the early days of setting up my lab, it was very difficult to get engineers and scientists. It took me nearly 4 years to get the lab to become functional and hire decent staff. Even now there is a tremendous problem in getting good staff. The situation has become worse because we cannot compete with the very high pay packets being offered by the industry. The biggest drawback in setting up an Institute in a rural area is getting good people to come and work. The rural infrastructure precludes any long-term commitment by people to work in such institutes. This has been the main reason why NARI has remained a small Institute.",
      "Was it worth it?",
      "Am I happy? Did I accomplish what I planned to? Did I make a difference in someone’s life? Are people better off as a result of my work? The answers to these questions, is resounding YES!",
      "Even with a small staff and infrastructure at NARI we have been able to do commendable work with lots of firsts to our name. Our Institute is well-known nationally and internationally. Our work at NARI has mostly focused on developing devices and policies for rural development with special emphasis on the use of high technology for holistic and sustainable India. It has been an exhilarating experience when some of these technologies and ideas have been picked up nationally and internationally. A glimpse of our work can be seen on our websitehttp://www.nariphaltan.org/which is extensively accessed worldwide. For our efforts in rural development we have also received quite a few prestigious national and international awards. Examples of what we have done include:",
      "Could I have done more? Certainly. However, I believe that  all these pioneering efforts have not only improved lives of people around us ,they also have inspired people all over the world. This has given me a great satisfaction.  Working at NARI has also given me time to write.  You can see my blog on Speaking Tree athttp://www.speakingtree.in/anilkrajvanshi/blog",
      "I invite you to join me in living a simple but meaningful life",
      "I came back with tremendous idealism to see a change in India for the better, to see the rural areas become progressive and the general level of living of majority of people to improve. In 30 years I have seen the tremendous rise of middle class in cities, the wealthy becoming ultra-wealthy and the corruption increasing manifold. With a large number of shopping malls full of consumer goods and an improvement in their so-called “standard of living” the upward bound middle class in cities gets a feeling that India has arrived. Yet 60% of our rural population lives without electricity and without the basic amenities of life. India is a young society with 54% of its population being below 25 years’ of age. The aspirations of this young generation, majority of whose members live in rural India are not being fulfilled. It is these people who are the future of India and yet it is sad to see that there is no national debate or seriousness of purpose on how to improve their lot.",
      "Educated and smart youngsters, who can play a very important role in rural development, are not interested as they define success in terms of a big car, a big house and a huge salary. They need to stop thinking on these lines. Sometimes I also feel that there is a shortage of good role models for these youngsters for developing their minds and reshaping their thinking.",
      "If you are looking for a challenging career, problems of our rural population offer the greatest challenge for any engineer or technologist.  I feel that simple as well as high-tech solutions are available to solve these problems; only if we are willing to solve them and willing to endure initial hardships. If we can improve the lives of our rural population then we would have solved the problems of 1/5th of mankind! I challenge youngsters to come forward by giving up corporate cubicles for fresh air of open fields to solve the problems of the masses.",
      "I have no regrets about coming back to India and especially to Phaltan, because I cannot imagine having done the things that I have done here anywhere else – more so in the US. Besides, living in rural Indian setting teaches you many things.",
      "For a starter it makes you spiritual! With hardly any avenues to spend money on and availability of very few amenities, one starts living a simple life which is the first step towards spirituality. Initially one does not like it but with time one starts to enjoy the benefits of simplified life.",
      "One can live a simple, high thinking and emotionally satisfying life in much less energy. This does not mean that we should live a primitive life. What is needed is to curb our consumptive lifestyle which promotes greed for resources.",
      "I, therefore, feel very lucky to have come to rural India so that I could develop this feeling of simplicity in my daily life and now I feel that it is my duty and responsibility to spread the message. I invite you to join me in living a simple but meaningful life. I have always believed that the purpose of human beings is to first become happy and self-contented and then give something back to the society. Coming back to rural India has helped me to do both.",
      "As I have become internally more secure, the level of contentment has also increased. I also feel that through our work we have been able to give back something to the society.",
      "Nevertheless in these matters one should try to follow one’s inner voice. If the parameters of success are to be dictated by others then one cannot claim to be internally secure and content. The measures of success and failure should be honestly evaluated by oneself.",
      "To a lot of people, I may have been a failure when after so much promise in US I left everything to come back to rural India, but I use the measure of my contentment and find that I have not done that badly!",

    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",
    "authors": [],
    "content": [
      "We had our convocation on 18th June, 2014. This time we tried a new format. For the last few years, we had one main function where there will be speeches, a few awards, in some years, PhD degrees were awarded, and then we had two more ceremonies later, one for just giving away PG degrees and the other for just giving away UG degrees. These degree giving ceremonies neither looked like a formal occasion nor a celebratory one. They did not have academic procession, or any invocation, no speeches, or even the National anthem. It was just a photo opportunity for the students and nothing else. In fact, the students were keen to slip out of the auditorium just after they received their degrees and they had to be stopped by closing the doors or having security volunteers at those doors.",
      "This time we changed to two full-fledged convocations, a morning one and an evening one. Both had a procession, both had their respective Chief guests, all the speeches, invocation, national anthem, etc. In one function, all the PG degrees and awards were given, and in the other all UG degrees and awards.",
      "It was extremely well received, but for one problem. The previous format discouraged students and parents, while the new format was attractive to them. Also, the number of graduates was higher this time compared to previous years. Both these things combined, the number of students who came to receive their degrees in person increased substantially, and we could not accommodate some of the parents in the auditorium, leading to some heartburn.",
      "What is the way forward. In the informal discussions with graduating batch, two points come out very clearly. One, they would like the convocation to be held as soon as possible after their completing the requirements. Two, their parents and possibly other family members be able to watch them receive degrees. Also, students did not like being given degrees without any ceremony. One also has to note that the number of graduates will increase further next year.",
      "The options are as follows (at least those I could think of, I am sure there can be more):",
      "1. Keep two ceremonies on the same day, like this year, and inform students in advance that parents will not be allowed, or at most one parent will be allowed.",
      "2. Keep two ceremonies on the same day, but shift the convocation to a later date, say in October, which would be inconvenient for many graduates, attendance will reduce, and we will manage to permit both parents of all graduates.",
      "3. Have three functions serially on the same day. Of course, we can not have three full-fledged convocations on the same day. So it will have to be the earlier model of one main function and then just the degree distribution functions for providing photo opportunity. But it is not clear if this will really allow both parents of all students to be present in the degree distribution ceremonies. It will be touch and go and may cause heartburns if more students attend.",
      "4. Have three (or more) functions on the same day, but allow parallelism. More on this later in the blog.",
      "5. Have three (or more) functions on different days. Again, more on this below.",
      "It is obvious that with the increasing numbers, we will have to have three (or more) functions to accommodate all graduating students and their parents in the convocation. The issue is whether everyone gets degrees on the same day, or is it ok to give degrees on different days. So, options 4 and 5 are really what we need to focus on.",
      "Option 4 can be implemented by having one function in the morning, and having two (or more) functions in the afternoon. For example, we could have PhD and Master’s degrees granted in the morning session, and in the afternoon, have one session for engineering departments, and another for non-engineering departments. This model is extensible to even larger numbers, since we could introduce more and more parallel sessions as the number of graduates increase. Thankfully, we will soon have another lecture hall with a capacity of 600 which could be used for this purpose. The hall will be available in time for the 2015 convocation.",
      "Option 5 can be implemented by either having the multiple sessions on two consecutive days, or having one or two sessions in summer and having another one or two sessions in the winter. For example, we could continue with the two functions in summer as we did this year, and have one function in winter where all those who graduate in July and December can be given their degrees.",
      "While it will be possible to have two parallel functions in the afternoon, there will be issues. First, one function will be larger (in auditorium with 1200 capacity) and the other will be smaller (in L-20, with 600 capacity). So their relative importance would not be equal in everyone’s mind. Further, we have a very strong notion of batch in the student body. To split the graduating batch into two may not be appreciated by students, since they also want to receive their degrees and specially awards in fron of all their batchmates. Also, in our system, Chairman, Senate gives all the degrees, and he cannot be present in two places at the same time. Also, in our system, DOAA office manages the convocation, and managing two convocations in parallel would be a challenge for the staff. But, these are minor issues. (For example, the functions in the afternoon can be split based on year of joining.)",
      "The other possibility of having convocations in winter and summer does not have above-mentioned issues, and it really helps those who are graduating in July and December. They don’t have to wait for the next summer to receive their degrees. So it is a very attractive option, but it comes with a cost. The convocation organization requires a lot of preparation and substantial funds. Doing it twice in a year would increase the costs both in terms of human resources as well as monetary costs.",
      "Sooner or later, Senate will have to take a call on this. But as of now, there is no consensus, and unless a quick decision is taken between option 4 and option 5, a lack of decision will eventually result in choosing option 1 by default, and a lot more heartburn amongst our graduating students and their parents.",

      "Mrs. Vijaya Ramachandran, or Vijaya didi, as she is affectionately known, came to IIT Kanpur in 1968 with her husband, Prof R. Ramachandran of the Physics Department. She resides in the hearts of many people as one of the founders of the Opportunity School and the Karamchari Sangathan in IIT Kanpur and 21 other schools for the kids of migrant laborers in Kanpur. Few people know that she is also the inspiration behind Prayas and had actively fought for workers’ rights on campus while she was here and even fewer people know that she is the daughter of the former President of India, Dr. R. Venkataraman.",
      "A few days back, I took a rickshaw to the gate. “Vijaya didi agar yahan par hoti toh sab theek ho jaata” I heard the rickshaw puller say to the cyclist riding beside him. From the back of the rickshaw, I promptly said, “Vijaya Didi?”. I had heard her name several times in Prayas. Before I could say anything more, he said “Aap Vijaya didi ko nahi jaanti? Unhone bahut kuch kiya hai hum logon ke liye.”",
      "The Vox team meets her at her present residence in Barasirohi, Kalyanpur. She welcomes us with a broad smile. As we enter her modest apartment, we see a framed photograph of her father and mother on the wall. She fondly remembers the day her father became the President of India, in 1987. In an age of no internet, TV and mobile phones, unaware of the news, she was gardening in the lawn, when reporters and journalists flocked to her Type 4 quarter (in IIT Kanpur), delivering the news.",
      "Back in 1970, when she was leaving her house to get her son admitted in the Campus School, her household-helper’s son started crying, saying that he too wanted to go to school. Touched, she wanted to get him admitted as well. However, later, she found out that a few of the faculty members had an objection to servants’ children studying with their children in the same school. These events played a pivotal role in planting the idea of Opportunity School in Vijaya Didi’s mind.",
      "Little did she know that the Opportunity School, that was the result of her and Professor CNR Rao’s efforts, would make a remarkable difference to the lives of many, over the years to come. When it was founded, some faculty members contributed a part of their salary every month towards it. The teachers were IIT Kanpur students and faculty members.",
      "The Opportunity School is situated behind the Media Centre and is funded by the Alumni Association, contributions of IIT Kanpur employees and a nominal fixed grant from the Institute. It caters to provide education from classes I to VIII to underprivileged children in and around IIT Kanpur.",
      "One day, while returning from the (Opportunity) school, Vijaya Didi saw a group of poor children playing. These children were those of the construction workers employed for the construction of the wind tunnel. They lived injhuggis(temporary houses)near the tunnel. On being asked if they attended school, they replied “School?… school kahaan hai hamare liye?”. Vijaya Didi was moved to see how deluded they were about the lack of education in their fates. With an aim to be more accessible, came the “Evening School” which she established in her house in collaboration with the Vivekanand Samiti, for children who worked. The Evening School would later go on to become what we now know as Prayas.The school was attended not only by children but also by a few parents who wanted to be literate. As the Evening School gained momentum, they realised the need for more space, and shifted to Old SAC, where it remained till last year, as Prayas.",
      "Vijaya didi tells us that the contractors were startled and worried when the workers began signing documents! She laughs as she remembers her kids asking her where were they supposed to study, with all the rooms in the house brimming with children!",
      "As she taught in the school, she learnt about the problems the workers faced on campus. They were paid just Rs.16 a day as compared to Rs.50, which was their salary according to the contracts. Due to rampant illiteracy and lack of guidance, they were helpless. To support them, she helped establishing the Karamchari Sangathan in 1987, which still fights for workers’ rights on campus.",
      "Her activities, as expected, didn’t go down well with the contractors and the authorities. The houses that the workers occupied were demolished and the families relocated to outside campus. The same year, Vijaya didi’s husband shifted to Chennai but she stayed back to continue the school. Amidst all the opposition from the authorities, she struggled to provide education to the families that were far away from campus. She visited brick kilns to convince parents to send their children to schools. During one of those visits in 1992, she met with an accident.  She left for Chennai, and the Vivekanand Samiti then managed the school. The Samiti struggled against dwindling strength and administrative hurdles but the school could not be sustained beyond 1995.",
      "She returned to Kanpur in 2001. Disheartened by the slump in the activities of the Evening School, she spoke to the students involved with the Vivekanand Samiti. Some of the students visited the Vivekananda Vidyalaya at Lothar, which was set up by the Samiti and Vijaya Didi back in 1994, and were inspired to contribute something back to the society. Education seemed a direct way of contributing and they took over the responsibility of reviving the Evening School. It became a club under the Students’ Gymkhana and was renamed as ‘Prayas’.",
      "Today, Prayas has more than 100 children who come to study from surrounding areas and around 30 volunteers. They recently shifted base from Old SAC to New SAC. Although the Prayas team tried their best to stay in Old SAC, they were forced to move. Old SAC is an isolated place in the evenings and is centrally located for all the kids. On the contrary, New SAC is bustling with a lot of extra-curricular activities at the OAT during the evenings. The disturbances at OAT, added with the increased distance for the kids always remind the Prayas team about the peaceful times at Old SAC. Vijaya didi often visits Prayas and teaches music to the kids. She feels happy to see that the foundation she had laid down was strong enough to sustain new initiatives and inspire students.",
      "Vijaya didi teaches children in her house as well. She misses the days when she taught in the Old SAC. She misses the zeal, the unity and the feeling of social responsibility among the students then. She believes that if the authorities, the students and the working community joins hands and works together, the system can be strengthened. She believes in education. In her words, “No child is born intelligent or dull. If given an ‘opportunity’, every child will grow up to shine bright.”",

    "title": "Branch Change: Finally we are back to being very liberal",

      "Recently, the Senate approved the branch changes for the 2013 batch students. In a batch of 820, the number of students who have received a branch change after the first year is 54 this year, a significantly higher number compared to recent years since we liberalized our branch change rules last year. Given that we also allow more branch changes after the 3rd and 4th semester, one would estimate that after those two semesters, about 8 percent of the batch would have got a branch change. I believe that this would be amongst the highest percent of branch changes in the IIT system (perhaps with the exception of IIT Gandhinagar), a sign of a very liberal system.Of course, getting into Computer Science and Engineering continued to be extremely difficult. Students needed a CPI of 10.0, and 10 students with that CPI could move to CSE. Getting into Electrical Engineering required a minimum CPI of 9.4, and I am surprised that only 10 students moved into EE. Getting into Mathematics and Scientific Computing as well as Mechanical Engineering was equally difficult, and both could accommodate students with a CPI of 8.7 or higher. Interesting to see Mathematics becoming so popular compared to many of the Engineering programs. And finally, Chemical Engineering was up for grabs at a CPI of 8.0. Branch changes to all other 7 programs was available at any CPI. This is really strange. Just a year ago, all these students would have been complaining about their rank and how they could only get Material Science and not Aerospace or any other such combination, but now when the change was available to anyone on demand, they did not apply. May be they did not expect that rules have become so liberal, or they have realized that there are exciting things happening in all branches.It does not mean that everything is alright with the branch change process. A restriction on granting branch change only once means that if someone could get his/her 2nd choice as a branch change now, would not be able to apply for his/her 1st choice next semester or change his/her mind altogether. Prior to this restriction, there usually were either 0 such cases or 1 such case in a given batch. So what is being achieved by placing this restriction is not quite clear. But for that odd student, this is a terrible restriction.The second problem is the minimum student strength. Departments which do nothing to attract students should not be supported artificially by placing a minimum student strength below which a branch change will not be allowed, or that limit should be low enough that every student with a decent CPI should be able to leave the department if s/he so desires.",

      "",
      "first semester. I proudly declared to my friends in Hall 2 Mess, “A mistake and fluke. I will score 10 in each subsequent semesters and will end up with a final CPI of 9.6.”  That was 30 years ago… But the moment and incident is still etched in my memory… Did I score 10 each semester? Did my grades matter later? How did IITK transform the once shy, socially inept, grade-driven teacher’s pet into a Dramatics enthusiast and a Security In-Charge of all IITK Events? How did my later choices transform me, someone who started with a Sales Job into a Coach at IIT Mentors?  If you want to find out, please read on…",
      "Hi, my name is Chandra Kant and I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1985.",
      "Beginnings",
      "My father worked for the Indian Railways, was posted mostly in small villages and got transferred frequently; causing disruption in my early schooling. When, one day, I returned from school after having learnt some of the choicest swear-words, my mother declared that we should forget about the small village Railway job and settle down in one city. We settled down in Bokaro, a small upcoming town, where I had all my schooling. In Bokaro at that time there was little social company for children of my age. I was a shy person, especially in this new environment and did not interact well with others. But I did develop a deep love for reading (novels in addition to my text books). I was among the top 10 students academically throughout my school life and was a teachers’ pet. I thought highly of myself, had an inflated ego, believed that I could do anything, and that I did not need anyone. Well, to be fair, to a school boy academics and marks are everything, and I exceeded all expectations all the time.  As a side effect, I continued to remain socially inactive and awkward, a low priority for a school boy. I did not develop any social skills, only academic skills.",
      "The JEE Dazzle & Subsequent IITK Welcome",
      "I cracked IIT JEE with an All India Rank (AIR) of 101 and dazzled the City of Bokaro. IIT-JEE was the most coveted exam and produced excellent Engineers and I joined the company of some of the best minds of the country. I selected Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur and went forth to conquer IITK. Back then, I was academically good, socially terrible, overweight and very sensitive. Those days, IITK had the tradition of physical ragging and I was a butt of lots of physical ragging. Fortunately I had a relative as local guardian. So to escape ragging, I started to stay at my relatives’ house nearby. Psychologically, I could not cope with it.",
      "The whole of first year, because of low self-esteem, I was plagued with respiratory problems and was hospitalized often.",
      "Once the ragging was over, I emerged from my cave.In the very 1st semesterI realized that there are lots of things to do, apart from studying. Since all my life I had studied, I went the opposite way, counting on my past ‘brilliance’ for good grades.Dramatics interested me and I quickly got involved in a play, rehearsing late into the nightand missing morning classes while catching up on sleep. Since I had not interacted with seniors during ragging, I did not understand the level of competition for good grades and the amount of study required.  In my arrogance, I also ignored all advice from well-wishers and roomie.",
      "In the first semester I scored 6.7. That came as a shocker. How could the Brilliant Guy, The Consistent School Top 10, Teacher’s Pet, IIT JEE Rank 101 get a 6.7/10?  Must be a mistake.  So “Nonetheless,” I famously declared to my friends in Hall 2 mess,“I will score 10 in each subsequent semesters, and therefore end up with 9.6.”(We were the last 5 year batch.)I dropped Dramatics, attended all classes and sure enough, I got great scores…7.9.  Oops !!…",
      "The Introspection & Enlightenment",
      "After getting 7.9 in the 2nd Semester, I did a lot of introspection. Empirical data of the 1st year made it clear that I was not cut out for academics and somehow I had to survive.  My brilliance had failed me; even dropping Dramatics resulted in only a minor improvement.  So, I started depending on my friends to get me through by teaching the barest minimum required to get by. I focused on what I loved doing best and was getting passionate about, Dramatics. In hindsight, I suppose Dramatics was a way of avoiding the truth about my laziness in studying, and an escape to keep me busy and justify my laziness in studying. I had applied to join the Counseling Service as a student counselor / guide, as I felt that I could be of service. My application was rejected. I think it was because I told the interviewers that I still believed that I could get a CGPI of 9 or above. I suppose it meant that I was still not in touch with reality.",
      "Dramatics, Technical Drawing, and My Big Size Became My Saviors",
      "My involvement in Dramatics saved me. If I had not get involved in Dramatics, I think, I would have been miserable. I did go through a bad phase and even tried “stuff” to numb down the pain.  I changed my circle of friends and rooms often because I could not adjust to their style of functioning.",
      "Dramatics helped me create a lot of friends; people recognized me and I gradually gained self-esteem from their appreciation of my dramatics skills. I also got me noticed by my professors (whom I diligently invited to all my plays) and I was able to have conversations with them which helped me not to fear them, regardless of my grades.",
      "The biggest boost to my grades and confidence came when I topped the Technical Drawing course. I started taking tutorials for the juniors, which were better attended than the professor’s class!!  It helped me to build the much-needed rapport with my juniors and batchmates, which would have been impossible based on the grades. I used whatever talents I had to build rapport and I actually became popular among juniors and my batchmates. Also, I had academic help from my friends. Life once again looked good.",
      "My respiratory issues miraculously disappeared in second year, therefore could be considered psychological in origin.",
      "I re-applied for a position in the Counseling Service. Due my rapport with the juniors, I got selected. I really worked hard with my counselees and they appreciated it so much that they canvassed on my behalf for Hall 2 General Body Representative Elections. I did not even go seeking for votes, assuming that since people knew me, they would vote for me.  I learnt that helping people selflessly was good for me. I also worked on the computerization and process creation of the counseling process. I discovered computers and I spent all my free hours doing programming. I had found my other passion!",
      "My huge physical size also turned out to be an asset. I got appointed in-charge of security for most cultural events like SPIC-MACAY!! Although I was not interested in classical music etc., by virtue of being security in-charge, I attended all such events and learnt to appreciate Indian music, dance and western classical music.My friends, too, introduced me to poetry, old Hindi songs, pop and rock music. Coming from a small town in Bihar, I had no exposure to this wealth of knowledge.",
      "Academics In Retrospect",
      "In retrospect, I realize that I didn’t pay enough attention on academics throughout my stint at IIT Kanpur. I took electives because other friends took them, without knowing whether they would be helpful or whether I would pass them. Some of these courses were tough and were really bad choices for me.",
      "Interestingly, I think I passed one of them because I offered a Professor a smoke during end-semester exam. I was a smoker and the professor had run out of tobacco during the end-term exam; I offered him mine!!… Thinking back, now it looks ridiculous but I need to tell the sort of ideas I had.  I had no idea what sort of jobs were available, what I wanted to do in the future, and I lived life one day at a time.",
      "This carelessness and care-free attitude showed its result during placement season,when the only job I could get was in sales and not in technology, that too, for a princely sum of Rs. 1,000 per month. I suppose this had also to do with the fact that I was so unclear about placement, that I did not know what I was supposed to do in order to get a good job. My interviews were terrible. Other friends around me had better ideas about what they wanted to do – Civil Services, Higher Studies and applying to companies like Tata Unisys and Tata Consultancy Services to go abroad. They took the advice of their seniors and prepared accordingly. I remained blissfully unaware.",
      "This dumbness continued even after IITK.The same superiority complex and expectations, that I am an IITian and people should look up to me, and that I am capable of anything, made me botch up 2 years of corporate life and corporate relationships,and if I had not been selected in IIM Calcutta, I would have been out of a job. I was lucky. IIM Calcutta sort of woke me up from my stupor and I got a bit worldly-wise.",
      "But, I suppose that naiveté saved me from a psychological breakdown as I did not worry about the future. I also believed that good things will always happen. I was lucky to have friends who supported me, and to have parents who did not question what I did or what I planned to do in the future. Depression happens when you think about the future and you seem to have no choices. Fear happens when we imagine a future that has all negative things happening. Living a day at a time helps when the future is not clear.",
      "30 Years Later",
      "Life has come full circle now.I have now become a professor.I left corporate life at the age of 45 to teach in a private business school founded by an IIT K alumnus, in Bangalore.",
      "I had learnt in corporate life that technical skills are not enough, and we need the right attitude and relationship skills to do well in jobs.",
      "This is what I teach in my courses and even published a bookon how to be an effective manager. I also became a certified counselor and do emotional counseling and career mentoring for all my students and ex-students, who have similar issues about academics and pressure.",
      "What Did IITK and My Life After IITK Teach Me?",
      "For me, IITK was the place that taught me everything I know about culture, friendship, loyalty and different types of people, although, I daresay, I did not learn much academically.",
      "The lessons I learnt at IITK and now during my counseling practice:",
      "1.  Friends and relationships are important",
      "2.  Don’t Expect or Seek Parental/Teacher Approval for Everything",
      "3.  Become Emotionally Resilient",
      "4.  We need to find our strengths and work with them",
      "In conclusion",
      "I hope you find my story helpful. I remained a not-so-great student academically, but I gained a wealth of knowledge in other ways.  What life has taught me and I want to communicate to you all and emphasize on is “Find your own path, focus on your strengths, and follow your passion.”  If you need any advice on dealing with emotional problems, career mentoring or what really matters in the corporate world to survive and grow, please do contact me atcoach@chandra-kant.com",

      "Today I am working towards my Ph.D. with the #1 professor in my field. Don’t lose hope. If you really want to do something, you will find a way ….",
      "From as far back as I can remember I have always enjoyed teaching and that was mylong term goal.  After finishing my BTech from the Bengal Engineering and Science University (formerly known as Bengal Engineering College), Shibpur, I joined IIT Kanpur for MTech in 2007 with a simple plan: I wanted to do PhD from a reputed university so that I can then get to teach in some engineering college. But 6 months down the line, my plan went haywire.. my CPI at the end of semester 1  was 7.5; in MTech a CPI of 8.0 is considered average and my rank at one point was 14th or 16th out of 20. During a casual discussion with my supervisor I was told that with a CPI less than 8.0 there was “zero possibility” of getting into a top 100 PhD program.",
      "No margin for error",
      "Well, I think my relatively low CPI was mostly due to two things. First, I got exposed to a lot of activities all at once. At one particular time I was the student placement co-ordinator, student guide in the counselling service and was also taking French and guitar classes. I think this happens to quite a lot of students who come from colleges where there are not too many “non-academic” activities.",
      "Secondly, the grading system at IITK is particularly unfair for post-graduate students. We were exposed to a completely new system of exams and we take only 8 courses during the entire program. With even-point grading system (A=10, B=8, C=6, D=4, F=2), a small slip-up gets your CPI down by 0.25. I remember, one of the mid-semester exams where we were allowed to carry with us one sheet of paper filled with any information we deemed fit. I had no idea about what to include on the sheet of paper; so I decided to add as many things as possible keeping font size as small as I could read. I managed to stuff the entire syllabus in the sheet! I went to the exam hall very confident but found that my sheet couldn’t help me solve even one question; and I got a zero in an exam for the first time in my life! Luckily it was just a mid-semester exam. I think it took me time to understand the nuances of open book, take home exams and the likes. By then it was too late and since we only had 2 semesters worth of course work, one couldn’t really bounce back from such setbacks.  The second semester was not too great either and by the end of it I was convinced that there was absolutely no way I could get admitted to a decent PhD program.",
      "A point worth noting is that more than half of the time spent during the MTech program is on thesis work (about 12-14 months out of 22). Quality of the thesis is also more important to professors looking for PhD students. However there are no grades awarded for thesis; thus I think CPI is not as important in the context of MTech.",
      "Is there really NO way I could do what I wanted to?",
      "Maybe people around me were right. Maybe there was no way I could do what I wanted to do, i.e., have a career in academics. My supervisors and seniors managed to convince me that I would probably not get a PhD in a decent place with only masters degree from IIT and a CPI of 7.33; so I stopped preparing for the GRE and decided to enjoy my thesis as much as I could. Also 2009 was a year of recession so my duties as the placement co-ordinator kept me really busy and pre-occupied. Initially I was not too worried about landing a job, but when companies one after the other started refusing to come for placements, I started suffering from sleepless nights. This was when I started questioning my earlier decision to not accept a job offer at SAIL (Steel Authority of India Limited) after BTech and instead join IITK for MTech. Suddenly help came from an unexpected corner. During a candid discussion with my thesis supervisor I told him how much I was enjoying the thesis work, but how I was also regretting my decision to refuse a placement offer with SAIL and do MTech instead. It was then that he assured me that he would help me get a job in case on-campus placement efforts don’t work out, provided I didn’t let the intensity of my thesis work go down.",
      "I never really felt any peer pressure. Perhaps this was due to the fact that my friends had similar grades as mine. All of us by now had decided that CPI was important only if we wanted to pursue a PhD somewhere.  We all agreed to have as much fun as possible during the thesis and forget the PhD goal. Joint GRE preparation session turned into simpleaddaat the canteen. My parents never put any pressure on me with regards to grades; in fact the last time they enquired about my marks and grades was way back in 2002 when I was in class 12th. I think it was mainly due to the fact that my parents had enough confidence in me. So there was no real problem there.",
      "Once on-campus placements started, in my first interview, the interviewer asked me something about Finite Element accuracy, I had no clue as to what he was asking. I just mumbled “physical intuition”, to which one of the interviewer remarked “That is a top answer” and my interview was over; just one question, no discussion about having the lowest grades among those selected for the interview. Later I was told that I had topped the written test for the job. I was offered the job but as the luck would have it, the company suffered several reverses and the project I was selected for got postponed by a few months. I thought a 4-6 month holiday at home was not really an option and so I started teaching in a private engineering college close to my home. It was a wonderful experience for me, I really enjoyed giving the lectures. I loved the fact that I managed to get a lot of attention from my students, I liked talking about engineering and liked being surrounded by people interested in hearing me talk. This experience also further confirmed that without any research experience, I could never be a good teacher. All I felt I was doing was translating stuff from the text book and narrating it to the class. To put it simply, I was just indulging in “high school teaching.” I realized that I didn’t really have enough knowledge to be a good teacher in a college/university. PhD was an absolute must.",
      "Why are you so ambitious? Do you want to be Kalpana Chawla?",
      "I finished my three months’ contract with the college, accepted the earlier job offer and started working in Bangalore. Things in my company were depressing to say the least. The project I was hired to work on got further delayed and I was benched indefinitely. I just had to login to work. I had access to the internet and lots of free coffee to drink. This continued for about 6 months.  This was when the memories of my experiences of teaching started hitting me. There was not a single day when I didn’t think about how good it felt to have people listen to my lectures. I knew I had to somehow look at a career in full time teaching long-term and for that I needed to somehow get a PhD. I turned once again to my supervisors who told me that with my CPI they couldn’t take me even in IITK without an interview. I applied for the PhD program at IITK and got an interview call. I was fairly confident that the interview in itself was just a formality, since my M.Tech supervisors wanted to keep me. I didn’t apply to any other institute.",
      "What happened in the interview room was pure horror for me. The first sentence that I heard was from one of the professors in the panel who actually told me that it was evident from my grades that I was not really interested in studying and the only reason I want to do PhD is due to the fact that I got fired from my job.",
      "The panel just refused to look at my MTech thesis and also disregarded the fact that my supervisor wanted to recruit me, he obviously had confidence in my abilities.",
      "I came back to Bangalore feeling a mixture of emotions; I was embarrassed, angry and also wanted to prove a point to the panel that what they were thinking was wrong; I had to find a way. My friends and colleagues thought it was very stupid of me not to apply to other IITs, to this day I am called “Ek goli-ka shikari”- a hunter who goes hunting with only one bullet in his arsenal.",
      "So I started randomly applying to all PhD programs that were even remotely linked to my thesis and experience. The free internet and coffee of my company helped me a lot during this search. It was also during this time that the project I was hired for finally got approved and now my company wanted me to work. It was fair from their point of view, but I now wanted to prepare a bit for the impending interviews.  With no PhD offers in hand I decided to quit my job. I had saved enough money to sustain myself for a few months.",
      "However, I experienced a lot of pressure from relatives, neighbours and the society in general. One of my uncles told me “tum ko kaunsa Kalpana Chawla banna hai- pata nahin kyon itna ambtion hai? XYZ ko dekho tumhare saath engineering kiya, ab 50k earn kar raha aur tum ghar main baithe ho” (Do you want to be Kalpana Chawla, what is the reason for so much ambition, look at your friend who was your classmate in engineering, he now earns 50K a month and you are jobless).",
      "Those were really tough days, but my parents never doubted my abilities and that helped a lot.",
      "A Rank of 257 in GATE was more diagnostic of my worth than an M.Tech. CPI of 7.33",
      "Finally, after waiting for a couple of months, I got a few interview calls (a couple from top 100 universities list of Times Higher Education). I was very apprehensive about interviews; my previous interview for a PhD opening was horrible to say the least. Even though my CPI was low, I believed that IITK had prepared me well for PhD in two ways. First, it instilled a certain level of confidence and faith in my ability. Second, thesis work is taken seriously by professors at IITK. It is great preparation for PhD, no amount of course work can ever replicate that in my opinion.",
      "I had a telephone interview with a professor at Katholieke University of Leuven, Belgium – one of the top universities in the world in the field of composites [www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2011-2012/europe.html]  I was pleasantly surprised when there were no questions at all about grades, my to-be supervisor asked me about how I got into IITK? When I told him that there were about 25,000 students appeared in GATE and I was ranked 257, he found the numbers absolutely stunning. In fact he reconfirmed whether I meant 25,000 or 2500. The project I was hired for was a good match with my thesis work and I duly got the offer. I am now doing PhD work at Katholieke University of Leuven, Belgium. My research group is well known in the field of composites. In fact, according to Microsoft Academic Search database, both my supervisor (Stepan Lomov #12) and co-supervisor (Ignace Verpoest #1) make it to the top 12 of the most prolific researchers in the field of composite materials. [http://academic.research.microsoft.com/RankList?entitytype=2&topDomainID=12&subDomainID=3&last=0&start=1&end=100]",
      "One day I asked my supervisor why he was not bothered about my MTech grades before giving me admission to PhD program. He said that if I was good enough to execute my master thesis so well, I was also good enough for the PhD. He said he looked at my grades keeping in mind how tough it is to get into IIT and that competition must be really hard within the class as well.",
      "I recently finished my first year of PhD with the world’s best professors in my field. On the yearly review my professor remarked that in terms of where a PhD student should be at the end of year one, I was way above average. I felt really happy with his remark. I have finally proven that I am indeed capable of doing PhD quality work irrespective of my grades or what my professors at IITK told me. I am finally doing what I am genuinely interested in.",
      "Ignore the people who tell you can’t do something, because you absolutely can if you put your mind to it",
      "The best advice I ever got and would like to share with others is that our admission in IIT is not a matter of chance; there is a reason – we are intelligent, focused, and hardworking and that needs to be kept in mind even when things don’t go as planned initially. I don’t want to sound elitist but even the student who is at the bottom of his class in IIT was at one time in the top 1% of the country. So don’t listen to people who tell you can’t do something because you can and you are good enough.",
      "During my MTech program, I had 4 interviews: one job interview through the placement office just before finishing the MTech and 3 interviews for admission to PhD program after leaving IITK. There were absolutely no questions asked regarding my CPI and grades. It was enough for the interviewer that I had been accepted into the IIT and that my thesis was relevant to their work. Keep in mind that it is generally believed that grades are sacrosanct for admission in the PhD program.",
      "On a somewhat unrelated note, another piece of advice I would like to give is to be responsible in dealing with people. For a lot of people low CPI is a cause of worry because it doesn’t help you get a good job. This can be avoided if you behave responsibly and have good relationships with professors. During my stint as a placement co-ordinator, I met different professors from my department to request them for help with placement. My plea to all of them was quite simple, there are about 30 BTech students, 5 dual degree students and 15 MTech students adding to a total of 50 students looking for jobs. If all the 25 odd faculty members help two students each then there would be a 100% rate of placement. Almost all the professors remarked that this could indeed be done but in the past all of them at some time or the other had bad experiences with students “who would join a rival company even if the salary offered was one Rupee higher” which had resulted in a loss of face for the faculty who had helped the student get the job in the first place. I understand that everybody wants more money but maintaining transparency and responsibly dealing with people would definitely lead to more participation from the faculty. Responsible behaviour from students would therefore be part of the solution towards ensuring that even students with low CPI get jobs.",

      "The Counselling Service joined hands with the Student’s Gymkhana to organize a ‘Session with Professors’ in all the Undergraduate halls intended for the Y13 batch . The session, a part of the extended orientation held by the Gymkhana Review Committee was meant as a means to bridge the increasing gap between students and Professors and provide the incoming batch with an informal channel to voice  their concerns and clear their apprehensions .This session was also intended as an experiment to replace the now obsolete Faculty Guide System.The Professors who visited the halls of residences were provided  with a specific  agenda for the session. First and foremost it was  to emphasize academic importance  – Career, Research, Scholarships, and Awards etc. It also was meant to emphasize the various opportunities the campus offers them to hone their technical, interpersonal, sporting and other skills and lastly, efforts were also made to make students aware about how uncivilized behavior can affect their day to day lives even though they might unknowingly assume themselves to be civilized.The turnout for the session was  high across all the halls as it was ensured that no Gymkhana Activities clashed with the session. Few questions were somewhat general across all the halls ranging from issues concerning time management to the professors’ own experiences as students. However the style of conduction in each hall was unique. Hall 3 and GHT sessions consisted completely of questions being answered, while professor Manindra Agrawal himself asked a few questions for around 20 minutes before answering questions in Hall V.In hall 2, A K Ghosh and Nitin Saxena were the professors who were invited to the session . The Assistant Coordinators of hall 2 summarized the entire event as extremely informal which was  exactly opposite of what was expected from the event by the students. The DOSA made the students sit where the professors were supposed to sit which helped in breaking the ice with the students right from the start. The Professors enlightened the students about the freedom bestowed upon them within the campus . Professor Saxena shared his experiences from his Hall 2 days which the students looked up with keen interest. However, a section of students felt the presence of seniors demotivated them from opening up freely in front of the Professors, especially the Hall Executive Committee members. Kirti Anand, a resident of the hall, said “The timing of the session wasn’t good. It should’ve been held before the Gymkhana General Secretary’s session because a lot of issues were already dealt with previously.”.In hall 3, the session consisted mostly of questions. Professors Sanjay Mittal, Shobha madhan, and Prabhat Munshi had been invited to the Hall. The Professors did not stick strictly to the guidelines making the Session more student centric. Professor Prabhat Munshi was extremely informal, talking nostalgically about his old room in hall 3 . The students quickly opened up to the professors and began to ask more personal questions about themselves. The questions , especially those on time management and previous experiences were answered well by the professors according to a resident of Hall 3. The students agreed that the session would help them open up more freely with Professors and would certainly interact more with professors in the future , on a lighter note, at least for the treats promised by Professor Munshi in CCD.Professor Mukesh Sharma and M K Harbola visited the Hall 10 premises for the scheduled session . Angad and Shashwat , two students present in the session expected it to be a pro – academic session .However, to their surprise as well as that of the majority of the 140 students who turned out , the professors instead chose to focus on issues ranging from interaction with girls for making new friends and also laid emphasis on the motivation behind living life at IITK. The professors , with their rich experience, created a very friendly atmosphere which made the students at ease to ask whatever they wanted to . Shaksham added , “ We felt as if we were talking to our parents . The two hours passed away very quickly. I hope such sessions are held every month.” The session was modified from its fixed objective by the Professors in consultation with Pranav and Abhishek, the Assistant Coordinators present . Professor Sharma gave everyone a take home message saying “ Do everything here in campus what you want to , but, do try and put in that extra effort in doing something out of the box.”",
      "There were quite a few glitches in the conduction of the event in Hall 5. Professors Manindra Agrawal and R. Venkatesan were supposed to come to the the event but professor venkatesan backed out the last minute and professor manindra agrawal arrived late. Professor Mukesh Sharma had however come back from hall 10 in the last 20 minutes to ease the load.Atul And Shreshth,the assistant coordinators were of the view that the delay was minor but the students  complained that around 40- 45 minutes  were wasted waiting.  The session consisted of a 20 minute discussion with professor  Agrawal in the Quad followed by a questionnaire session in the T.V room in which the professors provided solutions to the problems. There were issues with audibility from the behind while the session was held in the quad but were resolved in the TV room. The session on the whole has received good reviews from the students as well as the Professors with Professor Agrawal wanting to come again later.The session in GH Tower drew a mixed response from the girls .  Some responded positively about the session whereas others had a few complaints regarding audibility issues and lack of a specific agenda. Suchitra Mathur and A R Harish , the two professors who were conducting the interaction, were asked questions ranging from time management issues to approachability issues. Professor Mathur said anyone could come to her house if they were facing any issues and she would be more than willing to help. She also emphasized that academics should be one’s sole priority and in case of advice instead of approaching seniors , the best option would be to talk to one of the professors instead . However, a section of the girls were of the view that in these early days, they might not feel very comfortable approaching them directly . They also strongly opined against HEC members justifying the problems while they were expressing those to the professors.Overall,the sessions in all halls were received with a positive response from the students and the faculty . Both parties  felt that  more meets should be held to increase the interaction.",

      "After completing M.Sc. in Chemistry from IIT Kanpur in 1986 and PhD in Environmental Toxicology from Cornell University in 1990, Delhi-based Rahul Ram should have been a top grade scientist or an ace academician or both. But Ram chose to be lead singer and bassist of the band Indian Ocean.",
      "It is very unlikely that you will come across another IITian like Rahul Ram. To begin with hehas Masters in Chemistry from IIT Kanpur, a PhD in Environmental Toxicology from Cornell and has been involved in social movements like Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA). But he is most famously known as the lead singer and bassist of the bandIndian Ocean.",
      "Education",
      "Rahul Ram comes from a highly educated family. His parents were professors; as a result very high academic standards were maintained in the family. Rahul Ram decided to pursue chemistry and started preparation for IIT JEE but he didn’t like the intense preparation required and subjects like trigonometry, so instead he chose to join St. Stephens College, Delhi. While studying chemistry in St Stephens, he played guitar in various college bands.",
      "After graduating from St. Stephens, Rahul joined IIT Kanpur for his Masters degree in Chemistry. At IITK due to the rigorous system he was completely engaged in studies. He was still uncertain about his career path. In the final year, students in his batch coordinated with each other to get to the best universities in US and he managed to get into Cornell to do a PhD in Environmental Toxicology.",
      "Cornell was a happy time for him. The flexibility of education system there allowed him to take the courses he wanted to study. “I picked up the subject of my interest and spent the next four years (1986-90) studying social and development sciences along with my research work,” he says. Ram put music on hold but “heard a lot of it”. He completed his PhD in 4 years. With an all A score and strong research behind him, he looked for work with leading environment NGOs. But no good offer came his way. During his PhD, he also got married to Amita Baviskar who was doing PhD in Development Sociology from Cornell and was girlfriend of Rahul since Stephen’s days.",
      "",
      "",
      "Return to India",
      "Though Rahul thoroughly enjoyed his stay at US, he did not want to settle there. He hardly had a career plan and just followed his passion. He believed he had to be good in what he was doing and education is an asset. In September 1990, he returned to India and joined Narmda Bachao Andolan (NBA) Support Group in Delhi as an associate activist for Rs 2,000 a month. The experience of living in villages with tribal’s and in various jails completely transformed Rahul’s life. He realized that material pursuits and happiness were not related. Adivasis he met had no wealthy possessions but they were happy.",
      "Indian Ocean",
      "After the agitation he returned to Delhi and started playing music again to earn money. He had been playing bass guitar since junior school and continued to play by joining bands outside of Stephens and performed in events. In 1991, he took up his classmate Susmit’s offer to be a part of Indian Ocean for a show but continued to do his own things. Periods of uncertainty never bothered Ram as his parents and wife were extremely supportive. His sources of earnings were concerts, playing atjagrans and creating pamphlets for the NBA; Ram cruised through with ease. He enjoyed freedom more than money. While music continued, he started giving guest lectures in various colleges including the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi.",
      "Money was tough for the band too. Though their music had grown its own strong following not being mainstream music, it was rejected by music labels in India and abroad. Slowly as media abroad started to appreciate Indian Ocean music, the conditions for them started to change in India too. With the release of its albumKandisain March 2000, the band went on to acquire cult status and it changed the fortune of the band. Later, band worked on music for films such as Black Friday, Gulal, Peepli and many other projects. The international scene opened too. After their first concert abroad in London in August 2001 to touring the US thrice in 2005-6, there has never been a dull moment. The four-member band has held over 70 shows in the past one year.",
      "From managing his day for Rs. 10 a day, today Rahul Ram earns in seven figures. But it was never the money; it always was about freedom and passion.",
      "Follow Your Passion",
      "A strong educational background, single mindedness and passion are usually the ingredients of a successful career. Even if the choice of career is unconventional, which may include no one fixed career at all.",
      "In his own words at IIT Delhi, foundation day speech he says “Your notion of what makes you happy is what you need to figure out in your head. If you are willing to do what you want to do, I think there are some things which are very clear. You will be poor for a very long time but I don’t think that matters.”",
      "Watch his very interesting hour-long IITD Foundation Day Speech. It is worth your time.",
      "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrWvPAUwn1I#at=81",
      "",
      "“I hardly had a career plan. My choice of subject to study and the career I wanted was based on my passion. Two things I was certain about—I had to be good in what I was doing and education is an asset,” says the bassist and vocalist of one of India’s premier bands, Indian Ocean.",
      "Ram’s attitude to a career may not be conventional or ideal. But it may just be the sign of an emerging trend, where a tunnel vision to career doesn’t work. There are ways one can productively follow one’s passion and that’s by being sincere and hardworking in whatever you undertake.",
      "Ram discovered his two passions— environment conservation and bass guitar—rather early in life. “I started learning to play the guitar in school,” says Ram, who was also a very vocal member of a local eco-group that even went to meet Sunderlal Bahuguna in Tehri. Influenced by the Rachel Carson’s bookSilent Spring, he could hold discussions on impact of pesticides for hours. “I also honed my argumentative skills with facts and figures,” says Ram.",
      "The environmental activist in him has taken a back seat as finally Ram has found a job he is content with. From an annual earning of Rs 30,000 in 1990 to a seven-figure yearly earnings, Ram considers his monetary success spectacular. On the career front, he is rocking.",

      "The frailty of genius is it always wants to push boundaries; moral, social, ethical, personal. A young student sitting in his attic somewhere in England with regular gizmos could get through the firewalls of NASA and Pentagon as a hot knife through butter. While, no one on campus has attempted, or more accurately put, succeeded in pulling off something of this magnitude, the number of cases of hacking has been on the rise.",
      "A harmless hack of Facebook or G-Mail accounts is understandable and can be brushed off as a prank; but incidents have come to light in which the boundaries of ‘prank’ were evidently overstepped.It is well known that the webmail account is not very secure in the sense that it is easy to get the passwords. However, Facebook and G-Mail accounts seem to be the new targets.",
      "In some incidents that came to light, the Facebook profile and G-Mail accounts were not only hacked, but the information vis-a-vis, emails and chats were stored and anonymous mails were sent regarding the content to disturb the concerned person. On talking to people who understand the jargon of hacking better than the editors, it was told that in most of the cases it is difficult to get to know who hacked the account without involving the authorities which might lead to disciplinary actions. It was also brought to light that IIT-Kanpur with it’s Computer Centre facility gives ample opportunity to wear the garb of anonymity and indulge in such pranks.",
      "It is however to be noted that while people might indulge in a one-off incident involving such pranks, the Computer Centre in the information it provides on the usage of the facilities clearly states that such acts come under “misusing the facilities” and if reported may certainly lead to disciplinary actions. Boundaries can be pushed both ways. So much for online privacy.",

    "title": "Grading Schemes for Evaluating Students",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",
    "authors": [],
    "content": [
      "It is well recognized by educationists all over the world that having evaluation in terms of discrete grades is better than giving continuous marks out of 100 (or whatever be the maximum marks). IITs and several other good quality institutes have been awarding grades for decades. Slowly, other universities in India are catching up with the practice. UGC recommends this. And even school boards are now coming around to the view that giving grades is better.",
      "There are two questions that arise. Better in what respect. What kind of grading pattern is to be selected, in particular, how many different grades be there in the grading scheme. Actually, the second question cannot be answered without understanding the first.",
      "The grades are better than marks because they reduce stress on the students. The world over, people have realized that performance metrics are extremely important for students, and they work hard to improve their measured performance. There are very few students who learn for the sake of learning. Normally, in a grading system, the students do have a sense of where they stand in a course, and therefore, what grade they can expect. They can estimate the effort they need to put in to maintain that grade, and the effort that is needed to improve the grade.",
      "Basically, when they are studying for marks, then every extra hour of studies before the exam, could lead to possibly a few more marks, and that pressurizes the student to study more. While ingrading system, a few extra hours of efforts on the last few days may not give him an improved grade, and therefore, the student can be more relaxed. He can spend more effort on courses where the chance of improving the grade is higher.",
      "Of course, we do want some stress on the students. We don’t want them to be completely relaxed throughout the year/semester to the extent that they don’t attend any classes, don’t do any assignments, don’t study for exams, etc. If we take the grading system to an extreme and have only two grades – Pass and Fail – there is absolutely no pressure on the student to study, and that leads to very poor performance on an average. (Many universities have tried pass/fail grades for a few courses, and have had the same result.)",
      "On the other hand, if we have a finer gradingsystem, and if we consider the extreme situation of a different grade for every percentage mark (basically the good old marks scheme), then there is tremendous pressure on the student and that is not good for the learning either.",
      "So, we need to find a balance. What is the right balance – there is no unanimity on this, as can be seen by the diversity of grading schemes in universities of the world. But what is of concern to me is that the grading schemes get changed for wrong reasons.",
      "Just before I assumed the role of Director at LNMIIT Jaipur, they had decided to change the grading scheme, and many students and even faculty were not happy with that, and therefore, I had occasions to listen to lots of arguments  in favor of the older scheme. Similarly, we have gone through lots of debates on this issue at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Basically, students want a finer grading system. Let us look at a system where there are 5 grades – ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, and ‘F’. The students in such a system would argue that if they are missing an ‘A’ grade and get a ‘B’ grade, it is too sharp a drop. If there was an intermediate grade, call it “A-” or “AB” or whatever, it would appear better on their transcript. This is a flawed argument since the assumption behind this argument is that whoever is getting an ‘A’ grade in the current system will continue to get an ‘A’ grade in the finer system. They don’t imagine that if there were a finer grade, some people from higher grade will be reduced to the intermediate grade as well. In fact, if we look at a 5-grade system on a 10 point scale, where passing grades have numerical equivalence of 4, 6, 8, and 10, and if we assume that the students will be equally divided in 4 bins, then the average CPI (or CGPA) would be 7. On the other hand, if we had finer grading system, and we had grades with numerical equivalence of each number from 4 to 10, and the number of students were equally divided into 7 bins now, the average CPI would remain 7. There have been many universities who have changed from coarse to finer grading and vice versa and have seen absolutely no change in their CPI/CGPA. So, the finer grades will only mean a slightly higher grade in a few courses, and a slightly lower grade in some other courses – with the overall impact on CPI being zero. So it really does not help the students.",
      "On the other hand, while students wouldn’t agree – since comparing the impact of two systems on the stress levels is impossible for an individual student – the experts agree that the finer grading system would lead to greater stress – more competition amongst the students. So, each university has to consider whether their students are too stressed out, spending too much time on examination related learning – then make the grading system coarser. On the other hand, if the students seem to be taking the exams and other evaluation mechanisms too lightly, it is time to consider a finer grading system.",
      "At the end, I will like to point out that the grades reduce stress primarily when the student can do a trade off between the effort and the expected grade. This trade off is possible only when there is a continuous evaluation process, whereby the student can correlated the effort and performance over a period of time before the final exam. Hence having exams/quizzes/assignments/projects and other evaluations throughout the year (or semester) is important for success of grading schemes. (Continuous evaluation is anyway a good idea, even if one is not implementing any grading scheme – so that the students learn at a smooth pace throughout the year/semester, and not having to cram everything at the last minute.)"

      "Mrs. Vijaya Ramachandran, or Vijaya didi, as she is affectionately known, came to IIT Kanpur in 1968 with her husband, Prof R. Ramachandran of the Physics Department. She resides in the hearts of many people as one of the founders of the Opportunity School and the Karamchari Sangathan in IIT Kanpur and 21 other schools for the kids of migrant laborers in Kanpur. Few people know that she is also the inspiration behind Prayas and had actively fought for workers’ rights on campus while she was here and even fewer people know that she is the daughter of the former President of India, Dr. R. Venkataraman.",
      "A few days back, I took a rickshaw to the gate. “Vijaya didi agar yahan par hoti toh sab theek ho jaata” I heard the rickshaw puller say to the cyclist riding beside him. From the back of the rickshaw, I promptly said, “Vijaya Didi?”. I had heard her name several times in Prayas. Before I could say anything more, he said “Aap Vijaya didi ko nahi jaanti? Unhone bahut kuch kiya hai hum logon ke liye.”",
      "The Vox team meets her at her present residence in Barasirohi, Kalyanpur. She welcomes us with a broad smile. As we enter her modest apartment, we see a framed photograph of her father and mother on the wall. She fondly remembers the day her father became the President of India, in 1987. In an age of no internet, TV and mobile phones, unaware of the news, she was gardening in the lawn, when reporters and journalists flocked to her Type 4 quarter (in IIT Kanpur), delivering the news.",
      "Back in 1970, when she was leaving her house to get her son admitted in the Campus School, her household-helper’s son started crying, saying that he too wanted to go to school. Touched, she wanted to get him admitted as well. However, later, she found out that a few of the faculty members had an objection to servants’ children studying with their children in the same school. These events played a pivotal role in planting the idea of Opportunity School in Vijaya Didi’s mind.",
      "Little did she know that the Opportunity School, that was the result of her and Professor CNR Rao’s efforts, would make a remarkable difference to the lives of many, over the years to come. When it was founded, some faculty members contributed a part of their salary every month towards it. The teachers were IIT Kanpur students and faculty members.",
      "The Opportunity School is situated behind the Media Centre and is funded by the Alumni Association, contributions of IIT Kanpur employees and a nominal fixed grant from the Institute. It caters to provide education from classes I to VIII to underprivileged children in and around IIT Kanpur.",
      "One day, while returning from the (Opportunity) school, Vijaya Didi saw a group of poor children playing. These children were those of the construction workers employed for the construction of the wind tunnel. They lived injhuggis(temporary houses)near the tunnel. On being asked if they attended school, they replied “School?… school kahaan hai hamare liye?”. Vijaya Didi was moved to see how deluded they were about the lack of education in their fates. With an aim to be more accessible, came the “Evening School” which she established in her house in collaboration with the Vivekanand Samiti, for children who worked. The Evening School would later go on to become what we now know as Prayas.The school was attended not only by children but also by a few parents who wanted to be literate. As the Evening School gained momentum, they realised the need for more space, and shifted to Old SAC, where it remained till last year, as Prayas.",
      "Vijaya didi tells us that the contractors were startled and worried when the workers began signing documents! She laughs as she remembers her kids asking her where were they supposed to study, with all the rooms in the house brimming with children!",
      "As she taught in the school, she learnt about the problems the workers faced on campus. They were paid just Rs.16 a day as compared to Rs.50, which was their salary according to the contracts. Due to rampant illiteracy and lack of guidance, they were helpless. To support them, she helped establishing the Karamchari Sangathan in 1987, which still fights for workers’ rights on campus.",
      "Her activities, as expected, didn’t go down well with the contractors and the authorities. The houses that the workers occupied were demolished and the families relocated to outside campus. The same year, Vijaya didi’s husband shifted to Chennai but she stayed back to continue the school. Amidst all the opposition from the authorities, she struggled to provide education to the families that were far away from campus. She visited brick kilns to convince parents to send their children to schools. During one of those visits in 1992, she met with an accident.  She left for Chennai, and the Vivekanand Samiti then managed the school. The Samiti struggled against dwindling strength and administrative hurdles but the school could not be sustained beyond 1995.",
      "She returned to Kanpur in 2001. Disheartened by the slump in the activities of the Evening School, she spoke to the students involved with the Vivekanand Samiti. Some of the students visited the Vivekananda Vidyalaya at Lothar, which was set up by the Samiti and Vijaya Didi back in 1994, and were inspired to contribute something back to the society. Education seemed a direct way of contributing and they took over the responsibility of reviving the Evening School. It became a club under the Students’ Gymkhana and was renamed as ‘Prayas’.",
      "Today, Prayas has more than 100 children who come to study from surrounding areas and around 30 volunteers. They recently shifted base from Old SAC to New SAC. Although the Prayas team tried their best to stay in Old SAC, they were forced to move. Old SAC is an isolated place in the evenings and is centrally located for all the kids. On the contrary, New SAC is bustling with a lot of extra-curricular activities at the OAT during the evenings. The disturbances at OAT, added with the increased distance for the kids always remind the Prayas team about the peaceful times at Old SAC. Vijaya didi often visits Prayas and teaches music to the kids. She feels happy to see that the foundation she had laid down was strong enough to sustain new initiatives and inspire students.",
      "Vijaya didi teaches children in her house as well. She misses the days when she taught in the Old SAC. She misses the zeal, the unity and the feeling of social responsibility among the students then. She believes that if the authorities, the students and the working community joins hands and works together, the system can be strengthened. She believes in education. In her words, “No child is born intelligent or dull. If given an ‘opportunity’, every child will grow up to shine bright.”",

      "Rajeev Motwani, wanted to study mathematics and become another Gauss! His father, however, persuaded him to study computer science. Little did he know how closely the two are related? He graduated with B.Tech. in computer science from IITK in 1983 and PhD from Berkeley in 1988.  Rajeev was a wise theoretician that had the rare knack and desire to turn theory into practical applications. Whenever you use a piece of technology, there is a good chance a little bit of Rajeev Motwani is behind it.",
      "Rajeev played an important role in the founding of Google 15 years ago. He was snatched away from us on June 5, 2009, at the age of 47, in a drowning accident in the backyard swimming pool of his Atherton home after a party celebrating the end of the school year!",
      "Growing up",
      "Rajeev Motwani was born on March 24, 1962 in the Indian city of Jammu to Lt. ColonelHotchand Motwani, an officer in the Indian Army, and Namita Motwani. His family included brothers Sanjeev and Suneev. Given his father’s army career, Rajeev’s family moved often and lived in various parts of India before settling down in New Delhi.",
      "When Rajeev was seven, his father was stationed in the scenic town of Devlali near Mumbai, India. His family would walk a kilometer to the local library to get books, and the seven-year-old Rajeev would be seen reading the books they had borrowed from the library as they walked home! His brothers recall that not a single day would pass when he did not read a whole book.",
      "Young Rajeev wanted to be a mathematician, like Gauss. “This was partly shaped by the books I had at home. My parents for some reason had a lot of these books – 10 great scientists or five famous mathematicians – their life stories and so on. As a child, whatever heroes you read about you want to become,” adds Rajeev. Rajeev would read books of all types, including novels, comics, autobiographies and scientific books. Rajeev also loved music, particularly rock music. One of his favorite bands was Indian Ocean. His friend from Berkley days, Rathin Sinha recollects Rajeev’s love for books by Asimov, music by Pink Floyd, and canned chili and rice meals!",
      "A turning point in Rajeev’s intellectual development came when his family moved to New Delhi in 1974. Rajeev’s father wanted to send his children to the prestigious St Columba’s High School in New Delhi. St Columba’s High School administered a difficult entrance exam to admit students, and Rajeev studied hard the night before taking the exam. Not only did Rajeev pass the exam, he did so well that the principal admitted all three brothers into the school!",
      "Reluctant Computer Scientist",
      "After 11th grade (in the 10+2 program) in 1978, he appeared in JEE earning third place in the northern zone of India. He did not stay at Columba’s to finish the 12th grade instead joined I I T Kanpur, which at that time had just started the undergraduate program in computer science. “I truly wanted to be a mathematician, and my parents were hesitant because how do you make money as a mathematician, how do you support a family. I was basically forced into going into computer science even though I did not want to, but it turned out to be a wonderful surprise that computer science is actually quite mathematical as a field,” recalls Rajeev in an interview.",
      "Even though IIT Kanpur had an outstanding computer science faculty in the late 1970s, formal computer science education at the undergraduate level was still in its infancy in India. Rajeev was a member of the very first cohort of undergraduate computer science students at IIT Kanpur. Rajeev often recalled that IIT Kanpur had attracted an amazing group of people, and there could not have been a better environment for studying computer science in India. As a student, Rajeev was inspired by Professor Kesav Nori, who taught Rajeev’s first class on programming — TA 306: Principles of Programming. Rajeev recalls, “Wonderful thing about Prof. Nori is that he was a very inspiring person. He did more than just teach. He created such a wonderful ecosystem and developed a personal connection with his students.”",
      "Prof. Nori thinks Rajeev gave him more credit than he deserves. It has been 35 years but he is still so enthusiastic talking about Rajeev – the chubby, smart boy. In a recent phone conversation one could sense enthusiasm in his voice when he said, “Rajeev knew that purpose of programing is not just coding; it is to formulate the problem. Rajeev’s thinking was clear; his expression direct. No unnecessary stuff.  Rajeev had a knack for creating the most elegant and brief answers to the hardest of programming problems. It was a joy to read his papers.”",
      "Another instructor at IITK recollects, “Anyone who had taught Rajeev could not but be impressed by his class. At the same time, he was not at all competitive — if he did well, which he did, it was because doing well was so natural for him.”",
      "Gautam Bhargava, a classmate of Rajeev at IIT Kanpur remembers him, “As a fun loving, rock-n-rollin’ party guy, a super-smart classmate. Hardly anyone in IIT-days called him Rajeev. To us he was, and still is, Mots, which was not short for Motwani, as you would expect, but rather short for Motwayne!  After the younger brother of the movie star John Wayne! But this alleged younger brother of John Wayne was never seen wearing a 10-gallon Stetson; rather he was most often seen in akurta, jeans,chappals, with a cloth book-bag slung across his shoulder!",
      "Rajeev’s amazing brilliance might lead you to believe that Rajeev was this immensely studious type who spent all his waking hours studying and hitting the books hard. On the contrary, Rajeev was an incredibly fun loving guy always ready for a party! In his dorm room, next to his bed would always be a stack of science-fiction books waiting for eager consumption. Rajeev would spend endless hours solving the hardest crossword puzzles, playing bridge or volleyball, and hanging out with friends — then he would show up for the tests and magically ace them! Now if a course were “crazy hard”, say, like the one on Number Theory, Rajeev would effortlessly breeze through, with amazingly elegant answers to even the toughest of problems.  However, if the class were “easy”, Rajeev could easily lose some interest.  Rajeev thought time could be better spent listening to music or hanging out at the canteen eatinghakka chowmeinoranda parathas.”",
      "Gautam continues, “Rajeev was also quite a music lover with a particular fondness for Rock’n’Roll. During IIT years Rajeev was also the “Audio Club Secretary”. This was indeed a prestigious job as the Audio “Secy” controlled the keys to the Rock’n’Roll kingdom – and decided when and where the amps and the speakers and the other equipment would be made available. As usual, Rajeev took great joy in running that club and recruited a bunch of his friends to lug those heavy amps around! When this got too much he decided it was more fun to play the bass … his favorite tune for riffing on bass was “Badge”! Later he started doodling on the keyboard … and as our friend Madhavan recalls, they only played songs in the key of A-minor so Rajeev could just play on the white keys!!! Rajeev could also create musical wonders with another “instrument” – you just had to hear him use a wine glass and a fork to play the tune for the Bollywood hitChura Liya Hai.”",
      "Rajeev’s undergraduate thesis (joint with Chilukuri K. Mohan and Amitabh Shah; advised by Professor Somenath Biswas) was quite theoretical: “Specification and Verification of Computer Communication Protocols.” This simultaneous interest in theory and programming percolated through Rajeev’s career. Rajeev’s friends recall that in college he was not only brilliant, but also incredibly fun-loving and always ready for a party. There would always be a stack of science-fiction books waiting for eager consumption in his dorm room, and he would spend endless hours solving difficult crossword puzzles, playing bridge or volleyball, and hanging out with friends. He never lost this undergraduate spirit. Through his time at Berkeley and as a faculty member at Stanford, Rajeev approached research and entrepreneurship with joy.",
      "Never do work today that you can defer to tomorrow",
      "Everybody else was coming to the US for PhD or Masters or whatever. Actually Rajeev did not want to come to USA for some unexplainable reasons. He got a job at DCM Data Products because getting visas at that time (1983) was a big problem. He was also interviewed by the top three guys at Wipro – a small enterprise then. The interviewer said we would love to give you a job looking at your track record but isn’t every one with your kind of back ground going to the US on a scholarship? So have you applied to US? Rajeev said, “Yes I have an offer from Berkley.” He asked do you have a scholarship. Rajeev said, “Yes, but I am not sure if I will get a visa.” He got the visa and landed up at Berkley.",
      "In 1983, Rajeev became a PhD student at UC Berkeley. He found Berkley to be a very politically charged university – he would call it the JNU of the US. For 3 years Rajeev had a blast. Did not do any work and fully enjoyed the environment. His advisor was Prof. Richard Karp, who won the Turing award – which is like the Nobel Prize in computer science in 1985-86. When Rajeev had finished those 3 years without publishing any papers, he thought that he was not doing anything and letting this man down. So from then on he worked really hard and was quite productive for the next two years.",
      "In an advanced course on algorithms taught by Prof. Richard Karp the class was asked to solve a homework problem. With a fellow student and Prof. Karp, Rajeev developed this problem into a theory of deferred data structures: data structures that are built-up incrementally. This resulted in Rajeev’s first published paper, and he summarized it jokingly as his philosophy in life, with the words: Never do work today that you can defer to tomorrow.",
      "This is how Rathin Sinha remembers his days with Rajeev at Berkley, “Rajeev was perhaps my closest friend in UC Berkeley. We arrived in the same August of 1983 and I remember spending countless evenings at his Durant apartment going through his full collection of Isaac Asimov, having tea and ending the evening with fried chili and rice. …and then we went our separate ways. I discontinued my PhD program, took up a job, but lived in the neighborhood.",
      "When I got laid off in 1986, he helped me with my resume, in job search, and most importantly kept me motivated. He even gave me his answering machine in case an interviewer calls and I am not there to take the call. He was always smiling. Very mellow and soft spoken. I never saw him getting frustrated or rattled in spite of his heavy work load. He never complained about life, teachers, tests, or grades. He knew how to enjoy himself.",
      "10 years later – one email and we were connected again. His first request to me was to see if I could help a budding entrepreneur who was looking for some technology. So was Rajeev. For me it was like growing up with Greatness. Rajeev was always ready to help. ”",
      "In 1988 Rajeev was about to graduate from Berkley with PhD (His Dissertation: Probabilistic analysis of matching and network flow algorithms) and was wondering what to do next. Go back to India or stay in the US. Again other people made the decisions for him. Don Knuth, one of the founding fathers of computer science, came over to meet Rajeev’s advisor and told him that they wanted to hire someone young for algorithms at Stanford. So Karp suggested Rajeev’s name. Rajeev was then invited by Knuth at Stanford for lunch. Rajeev was wondering why this great man wants to have lunch with him. Anyway, Rajeev went to Stanford and met him at a restaurant near the church at the quad. He then told him to be with Stanford for a year and see if they liked him and vice versa after which if things worked out well they would hire Rajeev.",
      "He was offered a visiting faculty position at Stanford. He did not want that job as he was getting better offers and permanent jobs at other places but since it was an offer by Knuth it was hard to turn down. Rajeev thought, “It’s the like Einstein inviting you to Princeton for a job!” He joined Stanford and taught several courses and had a very good time.",
      "Stanford liked what they saw and he was appointed as tenure-track faculty. Based on his thesis work at Berkeley, Stanford realized that it was getting an extraordinary and promising theoretician in this 27 year old man. However, everyone underestimated the incredible scholar, teacher, advisor, colleague, entrepreneur, and friend that Rajeev would become.",
      "3 – 4 months after his first year at Stanford he got married. Rajeev met his soon-to-be wife Asha Jadeja in May 1989. Asha graduated from the University of Southern California and relocated to the San Francisco Bay area. Rajeev and Asha were married on March 22, 1990 in Delhi. They liked living in Stanford, and decided to stay. Asha started graduate school at UC Berkeley in 1991, studying urban planning and urban transportation, and joined the department of political science at Stanford in 1994. Two daughters were born from their marriage, Naitri (b.1991) and Anya (b.2003). In their tribute to Rajeev, Asha’s younger brothers, Yashwant and Yogi said, “Rajeev, who we calledJamaisaheb, was to the world a famous scientist, entrepreneur, and mentor. For us, he was the rock star of an elder brother that we never had. When our dear sister Asha married Rajeev, we used to pinch ourselves and wondered how we ever got so lucky — that this brilliant, humble, and incredibly handsome man entered our family and immediately became part of a large, cantankerous family — with such ease. In our 20 years of close association, we never saw Rajeev ever lose his cool, was always generous even to people he did not know, and became the darling son of our parents, and all aunts and uncles in the family. He will be with us forever.”",
      "Robots Taught Him Something Special",
      "Rajeev enjoyed teaching at Stanford. Since so many people were retiring or leaving Stanford there were a lot of courses to be taught. Rajeev ended up teaching variety of courses. He even created and offered his own courses such as topography and algorithms and complexity theory. Since he did not know a lot of these areas but he learned a lot by teaching these courses.  He did not get enough sleep! He used to say, “I am a perfectionist and I still get nervous to talk before a class even today. I get nervous, what if someone asks me a question and I find myself unable to answer it. So for this reason I always over prepare.”",
      "The nervousness taught him more than what he learned as a student. He landed up working in many different areas and it broadened his thinking, knowledge, and experience.  It also helped not get bored. He used to say, “I have tendency to get bored easily and so if I stay in one area for too long I quickly move over to another area. My threshold of working in one particular area is about 5 years.”",
      "Jean Claude Latombe from France, in robotics area, inspired him to see robots from a very different angle. He told Rajeev that there were a lot of algorithms in robotics which are needed to plan the actions of the robot. Robots require very high dimensional planning. It is like having a starting point A and end point B in space, and moving from A to B without being hit by any obstacles. The same task would be easier with 2 points on the table. Rajeev worked on solving robot related problems for 5 years, putting high dimension geometry and randomization together. Seeing the robots move and perform using his algorithms, he realized that he could do something mathematical but practical. He realized that his ideas, his work could have practical implications.",
      "He could now move over from the paper pencil world to the real world. He gave lot of credit to Stanford for creating an environment where people in different areas could work together making the whole greater than the sum of its parts. He spent one third of his time in doing his work in a theoretical and mathematical way and the rest in collaborating with people.",
      "Pfizer wanted to fund research on computational drug design. And while finishing the work on random motion planning in robots he realized that molecules and robots actually behave in a very similar way. His team came up with software based on his theory and they added some new theories. The project was called RAPID (Randomized Pharmacophore Identification for Drug Design). It went very well. Rajeev learnt a lot. He said, “It was an intriguing experience. I had to go back and learn my high school chemistry and biology and the other fun stuff.” The software is being used by Pfizer labs for their drug design.",
      "There wasn’t a startup he didn’t love",
      "Rajeev was fascinated by the transformation of academic ideas into commercial ventures. To quote his friend and coauthor, Madhu Sudan from MIT, “Having worked with Rajeev at an early stage of my career I knew how smart he was, but it really took Stanford to bring out his true talent, which was the ability to recognize the importance of ideas quicker than anyone else around.”",
      "Rajeev was active in the venture industry, and had a reputation of being extremely helpful to entrepreneurs. Rajeev’s students and industry colleagues remember him for his uncanny ability to connect people: he was a catalyst in bringing teams together and getting companies started with an element of inspiration and strategic guidance. Through Deutsche Bank, to which he had been an advisor, he became one of the first investors in PayPal, and Rajeev and Asha started a venture fund called Dot Edu Ventures in 2000. He was also a special advisor to Sequoia Capital, and was active in entrepreneurial student groups at Stanford, including Business Association of Stanford Engineering Students (BASES) and Stanford Student Enterprises.",
      "Sep Kamvar, a student of Rajeev who later became an entrepreneur recalls, “Rajeev had a selfless heart. At one point early on in our company, I had a conversation with somebody who told me he thought our company wouldn’t succeed.  Upset, I called Rajeev the next day, met up with him at the University Cafe, and told him about this conversation. After he listened to me rant for half an hour about how I was going to prove this guy wrong, he smiled and simply said: “Yes, you will.  That’s why you’re an entrepreneur.  Now your challenge is to use that energy to do something good for the world.”",
      "Another former student and now an entrepreneur remarked, “His ability of porting ideas from one to the other was unparalleled.” Jennifer Widom, fellow faculty from Stanford in her tribute to Rajeev said, “In entrepreneurial circles, many call him “the world’s greatest connector.” He had an uncanny ability to recognize that by bringing together certain people, magical things would happen. On a smaller scale, I recently realized that’s exactly what he was doing in our research enterprise. He clearly had a knack for matchmaking. deeply thought-out insights on most any issue, a willingness to help anyone anytime, and an understated but ever-present sense of humor.",
      "We faculty have a tendency to blather on. Rajeev, on the other hand, would sit quietly and then get right to the point. Rajeev left one hole that simply can’t be addressed. He forged a unique connection between the department and the entrepreneurial world—a connection that was broad, deeply technical, and full of integrity. That is something we simply can’t replicate with any other human being known to us.”",
      "Ram Shriram, a family friend remembers, “Rajeev had a photographic memory and seemed to have a limitless capacity to remember people, numbers, events, companies and the like. He was always accessible and approachable. His business acumen rivaled his technical prowess which made him a unique and potent force in the venture community.”",
      "Gaurav Garg noted, “Rajeev was one of those rare people who operated at the highest level of excellence in multiple disciplines. He was exceptionally observant, practical, thoughtful, yet decisive, with an unerring instinct for the right questions or issues around any topic, be it the game of cricket or a startup. I was always impressed by his kindness, fondness, and open door policy with young entrepreneurs.”",
      "Rajeev was a nurturing force for many startups, according to a close friend and GigaOm editor Om Malik. As an investor and advisor, he sat on the boards of Google, Kaboodle, Mimosa Systems, Adchemy, Baynote, Vuclip.",
      "Then Came the World Wide Web",
      "Around this time the world wide web was coming up and Rajeev got sucked into it. Rajeev in his interview with Shivanand Kanavi in 2002 recollects, “There was this guy Jeff Ullman, another one of the grand old men of computer science, who retired this year. He was in the office next to me and was in database. I was talking to him and a new student – Sergey Brin, and I remember at that time we were using Mosaic, and we were looking at the web and I was sitting there and thinking that we could randomize the web in some way because that was going to grow and become big and randomness was going to be important; though I did not know how and why. So I thought about doing random walks on the web and there was this problem of crawling on the web. At that time a search engine called Inktomi had just come out of Berkley. Excite and Yahoo had come out from Stanford so we had seen the first signs of all of this.",
      "I remember going to Inktomi and searching for the word Inktomi and it could not find itself. I don’t know if that is still true but at that time if you went to Inktomi and typed in the word it said no results found. My Godelian past induced me to do these self-referential queries but what amazed me was that this is a simple thing that people screw up on. So in the context of all this I was listening to some people from IBM talk on Data mining and Ullman had just introduced me to some problems in databases. I broke them down with a student and was getting pretty excited about the concept of databases. Ullman took me for this talk on data mining which sounded very interesting to me. So Sergey and Ullman and we decided to do some data mining on the web because it sounded like a nice mix. We then formed this research group called Midas which stood for Mining Data At Stanford. We did a lot of good work on data mining. Then there was this guy called Larry Page who wasn’t really a part of the Midas group but was a friend of Sergey and would show up for these meetings. He was working on this very cool idea of doing random walks on the web.",
      "When I understood what the World Wide Web would look like, I knew I had to somehow force randomness into it. When Larry showed us what he was doing, it was like a complete epiphany, we thought it was absolutely the right thing to do. So Sergey got involved and it became a sub group inside Midas. I was really a good sounding board for Sergey and Larry and I could relate to what they were doing through randomness. They then created a search engine called Backrub. It was running as a search engine from Stanford just like Yahoo ran till the traffic got big and the IT guys sent it off the campus. So these 2 guys would come to the office and say “hey we need some more disc space”. They were completely non respectful of me, which was a wonderful thing. They treated me like an equal. These 21 year old guys were demanding things from me. They needed more disc space because it’s getting bigger. So we need more disc and more money. There are still pictures around the building of how they used to use Legos, to create a box inside which the discs were being put. These discs were those cheap ones bought from the back of a truck and were generating a lot of heat. So they put it in Legos to allow for air circulation.",
      "For me it was a fun research project. We had a lot of ideas which we shared. At some point this thing started getting very serious and we wanted a better name for this than Backrub. So somebody came up with the name Google. Google means 10 raised to the power of 100. It is actually spelt as GOOGOL but somebody miss spelt it and that’s how the search engine got its name. Of course the official story is we deliberately spelt it that way but my guess is we miss spelt it.",
      "So Google started and pretty soon everybody in the world was using Google. The results were much better than all the other search engines going around. It was by word of mouth like I tell my brother to use it, he would tell his wife, wife would tell her kids and so on. At some point these guys said we want to start a company. Everybody said it was not worth it. There were 37 search engines already there. How would you raise money? How would you form the company? But they decided to do it and they did it. There were some big names which supported the company. Andy Bechtolsheim, an ex-Stanford guy who along with Vinod Khosla had founded the Sun Microsystems, put in a little bit of money. They managed to raise a million dollars. They started the company and it was right here in the university avenue. It used to be on my drive home so I used to go and hang out with these guys. It used to be wonderful.",
      "Then they took over the world!",
      "Right now the other search engines don’t even compare and I remember people who I don’t want to name saying why do you need another search engine? Today it is the most used search engine. Feels like I was part of a little bit of history and contributed to that history.”",
      "Sergy Brin and Larry Page founded Google on September 4, 1998.",
      "In his tribute to Rajeev, this is what Sergy Brin said, “Officially, Rajeev was not my advisor, and yet he played just as big a role in my research, education, and professional development. In addition to being a brilliant computer scientist, Rajeev was a very kind and amicable person and his door was always open. No matter what was going on with my life or work, I could always stop by his office for an interesting conversation and a friendly smile.",
      "When my interest turned to data mining, Rajeev helped to coordinate a regular meeting group on the subject. Even though I was just one of hundreds of graduate students in the department, he always made the time and effort to help. Later, when Larry and I began to work together on the research that would lead to Google, Rajeev was there to support us and guide us through challenges, both technical and organizational.",
      "Eventually, as Google emerged from Stanford, Rajeev remained a friend and advisor as he has with many people and startups since. Of all the faculty at Stanford, it is with Rajeev that I have stayed the closest and I will miss him dearly. Yet his legacy and personality live on in the students, projects, and companies he has touched. Today, whenever you use a piece of technology, there is a good chance a little bit of Rajeev Motwani is behind it.",
      "This is how Larry Page remembered him, “Rajeev was a wise theoretician that had the rare knack and desire to turn theory into practical applications. Rajeev was always willing to lend an ear and a brain to anyone, even to me as a confused student. With his always open door and clever insights, Rajeev was instrumental in the early work that led to Google.”",
      "Ron Conway, early stage investor in Google, Ask Jeeves and PayPal, recollects, “Rajeev was always so generous with his time. I was talking last night to Rajeev’s brother, Sanjay, and we concluded that there must have been THREE of him!!! ….one was always at university café and another was always at Stanford and the other one at google!!”",
      "Humble to the Core",
      "David Hornik of August Capital remembered Rajeev as a friend, “It is one thing to be friendly with someone in the business world. It is another thing altogether to consider them a friend. Rajeev genuinely liked people and people genuinely liked him.”",
      "One of his instructors from IITK recalls, “I met him only infrequently since 1983, but I’d get in touch with him whenever any need arose, either for myself or for a student. Rajeev would render his help promptly and he’d answer e-mails without any delay. Only now I realize, reading about him, how busy though he had been all through. I recall that in 1999 June I went to his office to meet him. When I reached, an undergraduate student of his theory of computation course was there to clear some doubts. From the questions the student was asking, it was evident that the student had put in hardly any effort in the course. Most of us would be very impatient with such students. Rajeev, however, was not only patient but also friendly– I still remember how beautifully, without using the whiteboard, Rajeev explained, just through words, why the problem of checking if an input TM would ever make a left move when started on a blank tape is decidable. I could see that the student understood the argument, and he left the office very happy. It was a lesson to me — I realized that people of true excellence have no problems at all in accepting shortcomings in others.”",
      "When Rajeev received Godel Prize in 2001, this is what he so humbly said, “I got the Godel prize for my theoretical work. In science it is said that one guy stands on the shoulders of another and another on his and so on. The guy on top gets the prize. In my case I was on the tip of the pyramid and so got the prize. Everyone forgets the pyramid.”",
      "Rajeev was a school mate of Shahrukh Khan, the Indian film star, at St Columba’s High School in New Delhi and had great admiration for him. In his self-effacing style he would say, ‘that guy (Shahrukh) is brilliant and will be the No.1 in anything he takes up’. Pushing into background his own remarkable intellectual achievements.",
      "Not feeling so lucky!",
      "Prakash Tripathi met Rajeev as a 17 year old at IIT Kanpur campus in 1979. Rajeev spoke to Prakash, ironically, by the IITK poolside.",
      "“Can you jump into the waters?,” Rajeev asked.",
      "“Yes, I can,” Prakash replied.  Not because Prakash knew how to swim, but as a fresher in a campus of India’s engineering schools, in a hot summer afternoon in Kanpur, dying in a pool was a far dignified way to reject life’s conditions then to submit and surrender.",
      "Rajeev didn’t tell Prakash whether he could swim. Nor Prakash had the courage to ask. But Rajeev inspired Prakash to convert our lies into truth as a homage to future. First thing Prakash did, after graduating from IITK, was to learn to swim in IIT Delhi pool. Prakash recollects, “It’s traumatic to me today that Rajeev didn’t. That was his failing as a human.”",
      "Rajeev, 47, died June 5, 2009 in the backyard swimming pool of his Atherton home after a party celebrating the end of the school year.

      "Academically, I went through a really tough time at IIT Kanpur. It is not an experience that I boast about or am comfortable sharing publicly. I have, therefore, concealed my identity so that my co-workers do not stop taking me seriously. I have not yet mustered enough courage to share the truth with many others who are very close to me. Still, there are enough details that I am willing to share so that the readers may find my story helpful in their own struggle.",
      "Humble beginnings",
      "I was a good student like most of you. In high school, I was a District topper in Bihar Board 10th exam and had topped School from 8th onwards. For the 12th grade, I received Rotary Scholarship, scholarship from local MLA, and my community also gave me monthly money for studies that I was to pay back without interest. I also tutored to support myself. My father, a 4th grade government employee, had limited income. I am the oldest of three boys. My mother is a house wife with little education. I wanted to get a job after 12th grade so that I could help my family. I applied for several jobs including a job as an Airman; but got rejected.  I started studies in a BSc program but did not complete it. Someone advised me to take the IIT-JEE. I was successful on my second attempt and secured a rank of 1600. I got admission at IITK in metallurgy. Rotary and our MLA did not give me any financial assistance to go to IIT. Lion’s Club, however, provided me with some financial assistance and IITK gave me merit-cum-means (MCM) scholarship. Things were looking good.",
      "I could do it if I wanted to, but …",
      "At IITK, I was like a kid in a candy store. There were too many things to do and try. I joined the Book Club, played computer games all day, read dirty books, etc…. You get the picture. In the first semester I got an SPI of 6.6. In the 2nd semester I failed all Courses and got an SPI of 2.0 and was put on academic probation. I lost my MCM scholarship. I needed to improve my CPI to get back the scholarship without which I would not be able to continue in the program.  I lied to my parents to get some money to survive. I also borrowed money from the Students Benefit Fund at IITK.",
      "I did very well in my 3rd semester and got a SPI of 9.1. This got me back the MCM scholarship. The late Prof. R. Balasubramaniam was especially very helpful to me. But in the 4th semester again, my SPI dropped to 5.1. I took summer courses, and failed 2 out of 6 courses.",
      "During the 4th semester, I developed romantic feelings for a local girl (not an IITK student). Things did not work out. It took me three years to get over the heartbreak. That did not help with my academics either.",
      "I failed the Engineering Graphics course 3 times (skipped the exam all 3 times) , had to drop it in my 9th semester because of a time table clash and was the only course left in the 10th semester to do and passed it with a D Grade. Engineering Graphics professor Dr. Banerjee explained the need to pass the course and went out of his way to allow me to complete the labs that I had missed. However, that was something which was offered to me by other professors too. I did not accept their offers as I felt that they were doing me favor and would think less of me because of those favors. However, Dr. Banerjee appeared to be an educationist first and a grader second, which was why I felt comfortable in attending the extra labs.  When the F list came out and my name wasn’t there, I asked Dr. Banerjee if he had passed me out of mercy and he said, “No, you passed it on your own merit.”  I felt good.",
      "I failed my B.Tech project thrice. (The professor failed everybody the first time. I didn’t appear for the presentation on the second attempt) and finally did both parts in the 9th semester. I wanted to do an excellent job on the B.Tech project and really put in some effort. Fortunately in the end I was able to find a topic which was interesting enough and a guide who was demanding but encouraging as well. Dr. Ashish Garg, my project advisor, was strict but was a perfectionist. Once I got interested in the project work, I realized that I too was a perfectionist. I enjoyed working with Prof. Garg. I did a great job on the project and got an A grade and also won best poster award in an international conference.",
      "By the time I graduated with a BTech in MME, I had 10 A’s and 11 F’s and a grade sheet full of F * and FR * with a CGPA of 7.2/10.    Failing courses at IIT was a nightmare and I barely managed to survive that. I couldn’t get a job on campus though getting F’s had less of a role than my inability to clear the interviews. I had little communication skills.",
      "What is surprising is not that I finally graduated in 5-years instead of 4, but how I kept going. How did I manage not to take the extreme step that some in my situation would have taken? What helped me? What can help others?",
      "I almost killed myself…….What kept me going?",
      "I got interested in Shiksha Sopan. The experience helped me understand that there are people who are in worse shape than I am. How can I give up? I have so much more. If they can see hope, I certainly can. I realized that I NEEDED an IITK degree. I deserved it! I could DO it. My conversations with Prof. H.C. Verma and my interaction with Shiksha Sopan kids kept me in touch with my roots.  I never got frustrated enough to lose faith in myself. Besides Prof. Verma, Professor Banerjee and Prof. Brahm Deo were very sympathetic and understanding.",
      "During the 3rd semester I also attended the Art of Living course offered on campus on Yoga and Sudarshan Kriya. It gave me peace of mind.",
      "After our 7th semester, the whole department went for an industrial tour of 10 days to Mumbai and Pune as part of the curriculum. I had a near death experience in Mumbai when I tried to board a running train in which my classmates had already boarded. It wasn’t a suicide attempt, just a mistake which could have ended my life.  I still remember it, train speeding up and I am trying to hold on to gate desperately trying to get in and suddenly I am thrown on the ground. Train is still running. Those few seconds, I thought I was under the train tracks and I was going to die. Those few seconds, my life flashed in front of me, my failings, my successes and my loved ones. All the cherished dreams and I remembered my mother, my family, the girl who had broken my heart and I realized I wanted to live. I was not ready for death. I loved my family and I wanted to see them, to go back home, to laugh with them and help them in their struggles. Who would be stupid enough to die when you have such loved ones to live for and so many dreams?",
      "The reality of it was an eye opener. Having been so near death, I was convinced for life that suicide is simply not an option for anyone and even those who do it must be terribly afraid in those last few moments of their life. But perhaps by that time it would have been too late for them. Regardless of my failures and whether or not I got the IIT degree, it was clear to me that I would never do anything to harm myself. My life wasn’t my own. I owed it to the people who brought me to this world, who trusted me and gave all they had so that I could have a better life and were counting on me to graduate and help them. I owed it to all those people who had enriched my life by just being there for me. I couldn’t die before I had fulfilled my duties to them, not even by accident, forget by suicide.",
      "When I went back home that year, I told my parents about the incident. Even before I told what I saw and remembered, my mother was in tears. My father told me that my mother had dreamed about it almost at the same time I had the accident. (It was about 8 pm in winters and people sleep early at my home) and I realized the world is connected in more ways than you can imagine and perhaps there is a God after all. I turned to God for my answers. Soon afterwards I joined ISKCON.",
      "My experience with ISKCON was very positive. It gave me emotional resilience. The philosophy of “leave results to Krishna, just do your best” encouraged me whenever I found myself in a hole. And I was in hole often! How can it get worse? I just have to stop digging the hole.",
      "I realized that everything changes. Nothing is permanent.  I learned to keep going believing that this phase will pass too. Many who take extreme step of committing suicide remain bottled up. They take every failure too seriously. They take every failure as a reflection of poor self-worth. I never let my failures frustrate or depress me enough to give up believing in myself.",
      "There was one more reason why I didn’t take the extreme step. Everything that bothered me, everything that gave me shame or guilt, I had it discussed with at least one other person; and people didn’t reject me. There was one thing, that could have caused me to take extreme step … it wasn’t academics or grades. But it was a cause for my poor grades. I still cannot talk about it even to my closest family members. I discussed it with Dr. Alok Bajpai, the psychiatrist at the counseling service at IITK. He gave me a medical reason for my problem and said it was okay. While his acceptance didn’t take away the guilt, however, it gave me enough support that I didn’t think about taking the extreme step. Overall counseling service staff was very helpful especially Mrs. Sharmishtha Chakraborty and Dr. Onkar Dixit. However, my academic performance continued to be lackluster.",
      "Life after IITK",
      "Life did not go smoothly even after graduation from IITK. I felt maladjusted in my first job. I was not getting along with my co-workers and roommates. I changed 5 houses in 4 years. A friend recommended and agreed to pay for the Landmark Education coursehttp://www.landmarkeducation.co.inHis condition was that he would pay for the course and I would return him the money only if I found the course useful. It proved to be a life saver. The course helped me to be at ease with myself no matter what the circumstances were. It gave me the power to effectively act in those areas that were important to me. It made me aware of my thinking process and guided me in my action plan. It released me from the clutches of my past and helped me look at the future. I felt like I could now move on.",
      "Didn’t employers care about my 11F’s?",
      "I couldn’t get a job on campus though getting F’s had less of role than my inability to clear the interviews. I had little communication skills. I sought friends’ help. They conducted mock interviews and helped me improve. A friend of mine who graduated from IIT Delhi, who himself found a job after being rejected 25 times, gave me an e-mail address of the CEO of his employer. I got hired because I demonstrated my analytical skills, logical thinking, and ability to learn fast. I could convince them that I was passionate about things that interested me and overall I am a hardworking individual.",
      "Many of my interviewers were not convinced by my explanations for why I ended up getting so many F’s. There were also several companies that did not care about grades — to them what mattered was that I had graduated from an IIT and had done well in the written test and interview. Most of my F’s were in the courses that I did not care about. I was good at software. That is what I wanted to do, but I could not change my branch at IITK. In interviews I emphasized what I was good at and did not try to explain my weaknesses. I submitted my grade sheet everywhere and HR or background verification team didn’t have an issue.",
      "Fast forward 6 years. I am currently working at a multi-national technology company. Drawing about the same salary as B.Tech CSE guys (I am from MME) with equivalent years of experience, performing the same roles. I also had a pretty satisfying stint at a startup which I joined as the 4th employee with one year of experience and stayed there for 3 years.",
      "What would I tell someone struggling for grades?",
      "Find what you are good at. Do well in those courses. Don’t invite Fs, Don’t purposely Fail Courses and do not think that getting an F is perfectly fine or a celebration time. However, if you do get F’s, do not despair. Do not take your failures too seriously.  Even if you genuinely struggle, Remember, there is nothing permanent; this phase will pass too. Talk to people. Talk to even Mean professors. They are not as mean as they appear to be. Have faith in yourself. Connect with the community. Look at the people who are in much worse situations than you are in. Finish the degree. Get a job, any job. (specially in software field). Prove your worth. IITK has taught you more than you think. Switch to another job if you are not happy. You have to find your passion; you have to find what you are good at and go after it. Don’t worry what anybody else thinks about your “success”. Don’t get in the rat race.",
      "I found following books to be specially helpful. Reviews inline.",
      "3. Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by Marshall B. Rosenberg",
      "Initially I thought this book wouldn’t be relevant to me since I didn’t consider myself a “violent” communicator. A few pages into the book however, it became evident to me that despite my easy-going nature, I had much to learn about communication. Dr. Rosenberg identifies learned communication that disconnects us from each other and is at the very root of violence. He then offers a simple yet powerful 4 step model that leads to respectful and compassionate communication. One catch – while the model is simple, it can be challenging to apply, especially when we’re upset. That’s because most of us have learned to blame others when we’re upset and it’s hard to unlearn this behavior.",

    "title": "Should New Programs at IIT Kanpur be Available to Existing Students",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",

      "In the last few months, IIT Kanpur has made its academic programs more flexible. For example, it has discontinued admission to five year BTech MTech dual-degree programs. Now, the students take admission to the BTech program, and in the 3rd year decide whether they want to spend an extra year to get an MTech degree as well. Similarly, it has started dual-major programs, whereby the student in the 3rd year can decide to get a second BTech degree in one extra year. Yet another change is re-introduction of minor programs, whereby a student can do 3-4 courses in a specified area and the transcript will mention that s/he has completed a minor program in that area. The flexibility is same for science programs also. The student gets admitted to 4-year BS program, but will have an option to do BS-MS dual-degree, or BS-BS or BS-BTech dual major, or a minor in another discipline. IIT Kanpur has also introduced an Engineering Science degree for which there is no admission through JEE, but students can chose to get into this program as a branch change option.",
      "All these changes are applicable to students who are getting admitted to IIT Kanpur in 2011.",
      "In my opinion, the Institute should attempt to make all options (or as many as possible) available to existing students as well. What that means is that the existing BTech-MTech dual-degree students should have an option to change to BTech degree only (this should be easy to implement for Y10, Y09, and Y08 batches, if not Y07 batch). It should be possible for an existing student to spend extra time and get another undergraduate degree. Again, this should be easy to implement for Y10 and Y09 batches, while Y08 batches may have to spend not just 2 semesters extra, but 3 semesters extra. It should be possible for existing students to opt for a minor. Again, trivial to implement for Y10 batch, and certainly something can be worked out for most Y09 batch students.",
      "Why should such a flexibility be extended to existing students is the question many faculty members have asked me.",
      "My argument is simple. Whenever we decide on a change, it is because we think that in today’s context, the new rule/system is better than the old rule/system. Otherwise, we would not have decided on that change. If the new system is better, then the benefit of that “better” system should be available to as many people as possible.",
      "So any change that we approve for Y11 batch, we should also look into the possibility of making it available to existing students. Of course, we may come to the conclusion that there is no easy way to incorporate the new system into the old, and therefore, we can’t extend the benefit to the old students. But, in general, the benefit of any good idea should be extended to as many stake holders as possible.",
      "Now, of course, those stake holders may have a different point of view, and they may consider the old system to be beneficial to them in some way. Therefore, most good universities, when they decide on something new, give an option to the existing students that they can follow either the old system or the new system (except, as I said above, in cases where adapting new system for old students is very difficult).",
      "Faculty members argue that if we extend any benefit to existing students, then we will be unfair to those students who did not take admission to IIT Kanpur, because they were told about the existing rules then. Hmmm. So we want to be more fair to those who did not take admission to IIT Kanpur, and less fair to those who did take admission to IIT Kanpur.",
      "By this logic, we cannot provide any significant benefit to existing students that we did not announce at the admission time. We cannot, for example, change branch change rules for existing students. An extreme example of this logic would be the following: We should not allow existing students to use the latest sporting facilities, since they were not told about it at the time of admission. If we had told about the upcoming facilities then, perhaps others would have been attracted to IITK, and the current students would not have been able to get admission. So by allowing such an access, we are being unfair to all those who did not take admission to IITK then.",
      "Peace!"

      "The act was deemed professional suicide, yet professor Purushottam Kashinath Kelkar accepted the post to become the first director of IIT Kanpur. The beginnings were uncertain, the institute had no campus until 1963 – 4 years after its establishment – classes were initially held at the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, but Kelkar persevered. He recruited young, highly qualified individuals in whom he injected his enthusiasm for building an institute to drive India forward.",
      "At the beginning of the institute, the government of the United States, under a pact with India, had agreed to develop it. This program – called the Kanpur Indo-American Program (KIAP) – helped to set up institute laboratories and academic programs in the initial years, leaving outlines that have shaped our current academic system. A three man team sent by MIT headed by Norman Dahl to study the status of undergraduate education, though initially skeptical, found in Kelkar a man who shared the same visions and ideals as they did, together they began to mold the institute into what it has become now.",
      "The first Academic curriculum was Kelkar’s brainchild. It was born out of his belief that the institute should not just make mindless machines. A large part of the curriculum consisted of sciences and humanities. He believed that humanities would make the individual cognizant of his responsibilities to the society while the sciences would help him create technology for a future India, a viewpoint that was agreed upon by Dahl. The institute continued receiving assistance through KIAP until 1972 when India’s involvement in the Bangladesh liberation war strained its relationship with the United States.",
      "The Student’s Gymkhana started in 1962, a wee little body with only cultural and general councils headed by the DOSA as president. Designed to voice students’ opinions, the students’ gymkhana has done a remarkable job in and out of the campus since its inception. Soon the body became solely run by students after 1968 when the post of president became open to students.",
      "The close contact with American professors coupled with the exciting opportunities abroad inspired many students at IIT Kanpur to pursue their education abroad. By 1975 more than 50% of the students went abroad for higher education or jobs, a ticking time bomb considering that most of the education in IIT was subsidized by the government. In the early 1980s disaster struck, brain drain had become a political issue and the government had made drastic cuts to the funding to the IITs. The problem went to such an extent that they had to borrow money to pay salaries to the faculty. Even simple stationery like pens were rationed. A committee was set up to look into these problems and changes were suggested. IIT Kanpur was advised to generate its own funds to counter the shortage. This was done by making collaborations with industry, a tie up while funding the institute, reduced its academic freedom.",
      "Antaragni kicked off as “cultfest” in 1964, marking the beginning of the first intercollegiate cultural festival. Techkriti, however, started late in 1995. After the inception of Techkriti, other intercollegiate festivals began to spring up too. The films and media council began Umang; the sports council, Udghosh; an entrepreneurship festival called Megabucks was also started. Soon the academic calendar became cluttered with festivals and student activities. To remedy this a festival pruning committee was set up. The committee, in its initial reports wanted to limit the maximum budget of festivals to just 25 lakhs and allow only two festivals, Antaragni and Techkriti. The gymkhana however opposed the initial proposals of the committee, a view that was taken in consideration by the institute. A newer set of proposals was redrawn and the budget limit was withdrawn. However, the limit on the number of intercollegiate fests was still set to two. Udghosh however was given the clean slate as it provided much needed practice for the institute’s sports teams. Udghosh still does not have a holiday on its start, a reminder of the efforts that the student body has taken and the role it plays (vote carefully)",
      "The institute’s unique education has produced many prominent people who have brought about sweeping changes in their respective fields, be it Narayana Murthy who helped found Infosys, Manindra Agrawal who co-created the AKS primality test, or Ashoke Sen whose paper on S-duality helped changed the course of research in string theory.",
      "While it is enjoyable to reminisce about the past, we must also remember that a future lies ahead of us, a future that should be built with blood and sweat and a future to be remembered.We should not only be proud of our institute but make it proud of us.",
