      "‚ÄòWhat does this place truly offer? Academia? Placements? Endless walls we call hostels? Or is it something deeper, learnings, late night chaos, friendships that felt like family, memories etched in corridors, and a quiet confidence that built over time?",
      "It‚Äôs all about how we perceive, how we mould ourselves, and how we ‚Äúchange‚Äù ‚Äô",
      "In this 31st edition ofAs We Leave, Vishal Himmatsinghka, a graduating Y21 student from Electrical engineering department shares what these 4 years, this college gave, took, and ultimately made of him. To know the breakdowns, the breakthroughs, and versions, have a read.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "So, it‚Äôs that time, the AWL time. Time for class of 2025 to leave, time for me to leave. Before I start throwing random thoughts tangled with some facts and advices, a little disclaimer that writing this was never easy. Sometimes, it‚Äôs too short, sometimes, out of words and all the time emotional to pen down this journey of 4 years in a single blog. So this is going to be about me who came here and the one who‚Äôs leaving. It‚Äôs going to be a long story short where a guy with a lot of ambition, immaturity and yes ‚Äòenthu‚Äô survives between the brightest minds of the country.",
      "So Hiii, I am Vishal, first I will introduce you to the Vishal who came here, yes we both aren‚Äôt same. So when He came here in the 2nd sem, ugh he was a bit unlucky and our college actually started in the 2nd sem when we got the chance to get back to campus (Post covid batch). He was from a small city Dumka somehow managed to crack JEE and get admission here at EE. Yes he was overwhelmed and scared. Scared because it was the first time he was stepping out of home, was not sure what he likes, hobbies??, insecurities? Many, academic bts (yes already had), surrounded by doubts that if he could make it. On top of all that, due to personal reasons he came here late, missed the orientation, which is counted as the stepping stone to make friends, know people, get acquainted with places on campus (Ig that‚Äôs why I still do not know places on campus :/) Knowing him, it must be quite obvious that he didn‚Äôt have many online friends either. Though he knew that it was a blank slate and a lot is ahead and he just wanted to make this count, wanted to make everyone proud.",
      "There is so much to pen down but Ik I am out of time and words (Today is deadline and it‚Äôs what IITK taught me). So will add some key events which help you understand how he became me (Ugh It‚Äôs already getting complicated. Also an advice to get used to acronyms, I use many :P).",
      "Ofc a memorable one for everyone. Mine was a bit different from the batch, 16th April 2022. Already missed an Antrangini too (yes woh Ritviz wali). Wandered in the scorching heat to get my ID card trying hard to remember the paths (Just to mention, I lost them both) looking around the overwhelming campus, the flora, the roads, bought a cycle too (close to me) and then I entered a lecture hall L19 for the first time, the biggest I had seen ever 400+ students sitting in a set-up of a competition, you wanna know which one? Guesstimate by FAC. Will make more sense as the story proceeds. It all felt like a dream which that lost kid wanted to live at fullest. Meanwhile I met my wing, my roommate (talked with him for the first time, not a surprise). I remember the next day having a quiz later on, of course MTH102 (Hated by all defeated by none). I just slept at 11PM, which was very normal for me, then I saw my roommate Praneat started studying and then I woke up at 6AM. He was still there on the desk and I realized what an all nighter is üôÇ Quite shocked trying to sink in how it works, it was kinda the first hit for me.",
      "Now this was how it started for me. The rest of this semester went into getting used to how things work here, followed by a disciplined life (For me it‚Äôs eating mess food daily and attending all the classes). And then clubs (Gymkhana wale :)) came into picture, in which I was involved the least earlier. Wanted to get in one as I thought it was important from ‚ÄòPOR‚Äô POV. Which laid the foundation of the next chapter.",
      "It wasn‚Äôt a great start tbh, had an operation dealing with health issues (dropped to almost 40 Kgs, yes real). But but, that kid wasn‚Äôt going to give up this early. Collected the will and tried getting into places he likes (which was itself uncertain). Found my first club, Chess club, got into it for creativity but it helped me relieve my passion for chess once again. Now comes SnT clubs, I definitely wanted to get into one. PClub tasks came and seemed out of league (Luckily) and had some past with finance so I tried to be in FAC which later became more than just a club to me. I am very grateful to my seniors (if you are reading this) for believing in me at that time, even though I wasn‚Äôt able to do the same. Worked hard as a secy, as finally I got something I like, a place I feel I belonged to and later on continued to become the Coordinator of the same club I attended the first event of. I got a chance to represent IITK in 2 Inter-IIT tech meets, and it brought me to the new definition of competition, teamwork and trust. The fight the GradCap team and Zelta team made, the sleepless nights had awakened something in me, a sense of purpose, the will to keep going, giving best and never stopping. It was my honor and definitely the highlight of the journey in between. Since we are talking about tough times, there comes the internship season at the end of 2nd year, dw won‚Äôt take much time you can find my journey here ‚Äìhttps://medium.com/@ug_anc/the-more-you-know-1-sde-8e04336dc07a(thank you AnC for capturing this). And I feel third year is the best as it challenges the most, being coordinator helped me to think like a leader, take upfront responsibilities and become accountable for others as well. I bonded with my team and luckily accepted by all. Someone told me I have this unique power to make people like me, I felt it here, it felt like a family where they looked up to me and it always kept me going. The journey in between wasn‚Äôt just about clubs, was much more than that, I belonged from hall 2 (I LOVE MY HALL), have special place for it where I became part of TEAM CANTEEN, a friend group that formed with the love of canteen food (Or the hate of mess) but stayed for much more than that (in and beyond). Being part of takneek, fests, elections, the grind, the unsaid walks, cycling and roaming around the campus (and ending up getting lost :P) are all core memories of this chapter as I move ahead with the final lap.",
      "And just like that the senior year started. Going back to college after an internship is never the same. An entire batch is gone, Some people close to you are not there anymore. This time when we have seen how the world actually works, we value campus life much more. Started on a rough path by losing two of my best friends to a different hall (H9, but actually never lost them and ended up even closer). And the stress of placements looms and odd sem being an odd sem brought many challenges.¬† Everyone nervously waited for the PPO results, so did I. But but but, I got lucky, before I started making a resume I got the offer, a dream got fulfilled. Was it easy onwards? Never. There was an emptiness, now there was no place I had to go. Days were spent mostly in the room, it was the time I spent with myself, learnt what I like, worked on my hobbies. Started appreciating nature. A peacock in the morning was making my day beautiful. It was a strange time, which left a huge impact on me. Meanwhile, did the placement season end here? No. Winter was coming, not me but my close ones were there, some trying, some helpless and I wanted to be there, it‚Äôs not even a choice. This was the highlight of the sem giving tests all day in G113 followed by attending the last Antrangini (gotta see Ritviz this time). It was a special one, like a break between the chaos until it turned into chaos itself. Then December happened, my people got placed and the final lap (the fun part) started. Time to finish the unplanned trips, Remember completing four trips in this duration, was finally able to decide I am a beach person over a mountain, winters over summers and my gallery was filled with the endless memories. Last semester is just bittersweet, it‚Äôs the time you want to stop, meet as many as you can and create as many memories. I wandered around to discover some new places in my last days at campus, visited some unvisited rooftops and also the places that I associated with. Parties all around‚Ä¶ Discovered another side of me. (Being a senior you have to give many, so be prepared :)) This time you care less about things once most important for you (yes talking about acads). This final lap helped me find myself.",
      "Finally, let‚Äôs meet up now. Hiii, I am Vishal and I find myself lucky to spend most of the time in college on this beautiful campus. Now in a big city, Bangalore somehow managed to crack a decent job. Yes, now I am confident because of the love and experiences I got here. Hobbies?? Many ‚Äì You can find me scratching my pen on a diary trying to pen down a thought, a poem or a story. Or maybe doing some sort of digital art. And yes sometimes sliding over the candlesticks (I meant markets, weird hobbies ik). Can talk about N series and anime, started reading books and ofc chess, I love it. Though still clumsy and messy, lost in directions and yes some things never change, maybe for the good. On top of all that, I participated in all the final year rituals, including batch photoshoots, or dance extravaganza, writing emo wale testimonials, or scribbling day, or writing letter to 10 years future me (talking with future and past, yes Dark is going on:)) and finally farewells, the parties and writing this AWL. This Vishal didn‚Äôt miss any of them. And now knowing me, it must be quite obvious that I met many amazing people on this journey. The blank slate is filled with memories of lifetime, learnings to stay forever and people to stay close. And yes, the first year me, made everyone proud from where he is, leaving with gratitude!",
      "So thus I learnt, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant. Embrace it, don‚Äôt differentiate it‚Äù (else it will be zero) üòâ",
      "The family I made here. Ones who loved me unconditionally and were there for me. This one is going to stay. No words can describe its importance. ALWAYS TOGETHER.",
      "The smallest wing that made me feel included. Always felt a special bond, will remember the parties, fun and trips. Thank y‚Äôall.",
      "FAC:My club, that helped me grow the most.",
      "The best people I met, the place that gave me confidence. A part of me will always be there and a part of FAC with me. V0DK@S forever.",
      "That random group with not so random yaari. Most comfortable people to joke with,sit with, and share with. Matlabi aise ho toh matlabi duniya hi sahi hai!",
      "Ones very close to me. Always respectful and supportive, fun to party with. Motivated me to work harder. Will miss them a lot and wish them all the success. Thanks for your not so legal testimonials!",
      "Thank you for getting here, believing in yourself and never giving up. Now it‚Äôs my turn to make you proud.",
      "As he leave, he leaves with pride,High on emotions, nothing to hide.A lot to carry, a lot in sight,He is leaving, but something of him will live inside.",
      "When he came, was like a broken vase,Tough to find pieces, touching gives scars.He felt alone, in a sea of crowd,Always thinking what this missing all about.He was scared, inside his room,Hesitant to step out like there is some goon.",
      "But his will was stronger, he wanted to fight,He wanted to live, even its wrong or right.He got some people, some purpose to chase,Seems he is now getting use to this maze.But ups and downs always came his way,Again he broke, again he stayed.",
      "He was getting good, the prison is home,Not leaving this is the only thing he hope.Solving the puzzle, he found himself,In a place where he just wanted to escape.The new him loves whatever comes by,Applauding whatever the old one went by.",
      "Though time to part had drawn in near,The broken pieces of vase reappeared.He wanted to live all once again, but someone said it right,Good things last like that one magical night.He will miss the streets, the sky the trees around,Like they helped to get him found.",
      "As he leaves, he leaves a lot behind,Taking things all in his mind.He will miss his friends, his people around,Ahh he is crying while writing this down.But yes we know, now he is strongSo when he leave he will leave with a smile,And when he returns, wave ‚ÄúHiii‚Äù from a mile!",
      "Thanks to the reader if you stick it till here. I hope you can relate or learn something from my story (Everyone has their own, create yours). Ever need BTS of any chapter just ping I am here ‚Äì @_.vishal_03._ and professionally I am here ‚Äì https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-himmatsinghka-a82831240",
      "Thanks to Vox for giving me this opportunity of pouring my thoughts for this last time and my CGM Suhani for the patience.",
      "Lastly, thanks to my family, friends for being there for me in this journey and all along.",

      "In this 30th edition of As We Leave, Dwija Kakkad, a Y21 from the Department of Mathematics pens a story not of milestones, but of moments‚Äîof growing up, faltering, recalibrating, and learning to simply be. What began as a pursuit of ‚Äúcool‚Äù slowly gave way to quiet confidence, built on reflection.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "I always write methodically, professionally, afraid to let my feelings show. In this AWL, I will try to pen down my thoughts as they come, unfiltered. I have been reading all the AWLs Vox released since my first year, and the AWLs I enjoyed reading the most were the ones which offered a window into the writer‚Äôs mind, the ones which told the story of a person, of their campus experience. I intend to write a similar AWL.A story of my three and a half years here, consisting of anecdotes, some unsolicited advice, and more importantly, my emotions.I do not remember my years here in a linear fashion; some instances stand out more than others. If I sit back and think about what I remember‚Äì it‚Äôs random things‚Äì getting locked on the OAT rooftop with two other idiots yelling ‚Äòghost, ghost!,¬† listening to Ed Sheeran‚Äôs Subtract album on loop in KD during the intern-prep summer, late night ice-cream at Doaa canteen in study ‚Äòbreaks‚Äô, getting ready with the wing during fests, endless yap sessions at CCD. I am also more inclined to remember the highs than the lows. Perhaps that‚Äôs why my heart is full with the memories I made in my last semester here.",
      "I have prided myself in being someone fairly emotionally detached from places and things. Unlike my friends, I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòsenti‚Äô or nostalgic during the last fest, or farewell, or the batch shoots, or even on the last day of classes. I felt a little guilty, too, for not feeling like I will miss this place or the people. I now realise that I was in denial. I don‚Äôt believe that this is the end. Every time an event occurs, my mind finds solace in the fact that at least we have that next thing planned. After attending the last ‚Äúthing‚Äù, sitting at the airport waiting to board the flight back home, I have nothing to look forward to. And that‚Äôs when it hits, the sentimentality, the nostalgia, the feeling of leaving a piece of yourself behind in a place, and taking a piece of everyone you loved back with you.",
      "Recency bias plays a big role in me feeling so fondly towards this place, as I can confidently say that my 8th semester here was probably the best four months of my life. My journey here was far from linear, with me experiencing a myriad of emotions. I had started off as an ignorant kid, determined to leave her nerd self behind, and become ‚Äòcool‚Äô. I blatantly ignored academics in the online semester, I didn‚Äôt even have a benchmark on what a good CPI was. I remember asking a friend during the first ESC101 class if ‚Äòhard code‚Äô meant using ‚Äòharder‚Äô code for a simple task :). After coming to campus, I started caring a lot more about having the best college experience ever. I was determined to make a bunch of friends ‚Äòfor life‚Äô, determined to balance studying and making memories (they are not mutually exclusive, I realised much later). I even bought into the mindset of a few seniors I interacted with initially: ‚Äúacads toh hota rehta hai, make sure you do something worthwhile in your time here‚Äù. As a result, I stepped a little too much out of my comfort zone and allowed people to come much closer to me than I was comfortable with. I blindly followed the ‚Äòin‚Äô things to do: study all night the day before exams, join all the clubs you can, don‚Äôt attend classes. This bit me in the back (quite heavily, I must add). By the end of my third semester, I had dug myself into a deep academic hole, I felt suffocated in my friendships, and as a result withdrew fully, I stopped working for all the clubs I had joined. One great decision I made, however, was to apply to be a student guide. The 9 days of orientation were the highlight of that semester. The winter break after the third semester was spent doing almost nothing at home; I had even given up hope on preparing for the upcoming internship season.",
      "I remember less the consequent semesters. Determined to do well in courses, I became antisocial, interacting with very few people, and started attending all classes. A ‚ÄúComplex Analysis‚Äù course I had to take in my fifth semester, a particular professor I started working with, a friend I made in my fourth semester, collectively helped me get out of this rut, although they probably don‚Äôt know it. I started enjoying math (just enough to get myself to study), actively started figuring out what I wanted to do in life, and started making new friends. I even went on my first college trip to Goa! I had always wanted to go for higher studies, but I had always restrained myself, thinking it almost impossible with my grades. However, I regained optimism after a few semesters of better performance, and somewhere in the 6th semester, I started toying with this idea again. Halfway into my corporate internship, I made the decision to apply to PhD programs in Statistics, and that summer was the busiest I had ever been‚Äìworking on projects, learning skills, preparing for the GRE, exploring Mumbai, and working just enough to justify my stipend :). My last semester was the zenith of my days here. I went on a trek with my equally unfit wingies, had a little too much fun in Techkriti üòâ , peaked academically, got into my dream program, and most importantly,I found a bunch of people, who I care about enough to make a serious effort to keep in my life.",
      "Having experienced every possible emotion, from heartbreak to finding new love, losing friends and gaining new ones, seriously considering dropping out and joining a local college to making the decision to pursue (and hopefully complete) a PhD, trying to change my personality to fit in, to abandoning that and living the way I want and eventually finding people with whom hanging out felt effortless. Sleeping at 11 pm and faking headaches to avoid 12 am birthday celebrations to pulling all-nighters with friends, picking up multiple PoRs in a semester and abandoning them all to work on my abysmal grades. Religiously running home every break to planning multiple trips a semester (and running home on long weekends because some things don‚Äôt change), begging a prof relentlessly for three semesters to give me a project to end up publishing with her, not attending classes to pursuing professors even in office hours and back to not attending classes in my last semester, I feel like I‚Äôve had my fair share of college ‚Äòexperiences,‚Äô regardless of whether they conform to others‚Äô ideas of ‚Äòworthwhile‚Äô. Do I have regrets? Yes. I wish I had been smarter about managing my academics, I could have been more involved in the clubs I was a part of. I wish I had explored the campus more. I wish I had performed in at least one ME. But eh, you win some, you lose some. It‚Äôs all part of the story.",
      "If anything, these years here have taught me that coolness is subjective, and running behind an arbitrary definition of ‚Äòcool‚Äô does no good at all. There is no set-in-stone bucket list of things one ‚Äúmust‚Äù do at IITK to truly live the ‚Äòcollege experience‚Äô. You make your own bucket list, and each is as good as the other. You write your own story. Advice from seniors and professors is highly personal and what works for one mostly doesn‚Äôt for another. All you can do is listen to this advice, make what you can of it, and try to do your best. Be comfortable with yourself. The confidence you get when you don‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone you‚Äôre not is worth it. One last piece of advice, or rather observation I will share, is that seeking help shamelessly has no loss and potentially infinite rewards. Go ask that professor to explain that proof, ask that topper to share their notes, ask seniors about what clubs to join, what internships to apply for, ask that friend to help you drape your saree. Not only will your effort be reduced, you might just find a bond for life.",
      "I entered IITK an ignorant kid, desperate to leave her nerd self behind, and I am leaving IITK an ignorant adult embracing herself the way she is, and ready to make her fair share of mistakes in another country.",

Before writing this, I was in complete mayhem, where to begin, where to end, what all to include, and most importantly, how to conclude everything in a single extract with a perfect moral to it. C‚Äômon, life isn‚Äôt perfect, and neither am I, especially in the writing part, God forbid! So here‚Äôs my feeble attempt at bringing to you the journey of a boy, an introvert, so much so that he won‚Äôt leave his room for days, to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt even get the chance to come to his room for days. Throughout my journey, one thing I came to believe was ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",

      "The old me, who was rejoicing in a corner for getting IITKGP MnC in the first round, had no idea how his table would turn around in the 5th round with his seat upgradation to IITK EE. I didn‚Äôt have enough rank based on the past cutoff of EE here, how could it happen? Let‚Äôs just say it was all pre-destined, as I had only filled IITK EE above in choice, I was certain I won‚Äôt get it. But that time, I couldn‚Äôt regret it more. The academics of Kanpur, and on top of that, Electrical, the one thing that not only Facebook and Quora (c‚Äômon, it was really popular then) but my own physics solving capabilities refused the most. I couldn‚Äôt regret my life choice anymore than.",
      "",
      "Fast-forwarding to the online semester. The fear of how I would sustain competition here, since now everyone around me is better in their own way, at least that‚Äôs what I thought. All the struggle of the past 2 years of JEE prep came up, all the work I did had gone to vain? My fears came to life when I got TA101 as one of the courses. As a person who can‚Äôt, for my own life, draw a single straight line, having to draw all 4 views of random objects, was nothing short of depression to me. My introvertedness was only adding to it, and with it being online sem, the only person to whom I could reach out for help was my elder brother, who would help me do my assignments. I was so much of an introvert that even during the online bulla sessions, I wouldn‚Äôt connect with anyone, switching off my cam & mic all the time, I didn‚Äôt even know any of my wingies‚Äô names (or what does wing mean), no contact was made, I was as solitary as you can imagine me to be. Somehow, I managed the online thing by simply doing nothing except ranting about my choice.",
      "Then one very fine day, when we received mail about our offline return, it was nothing short of happiness for me, but there, in hindsight, was this introverted person with low self-esteem and confidence owing to his fear of disinterest in chosen major, whispering in his ear all the things that could go wrong. There I was on the IIT Kanpur campus, trying to make myself a little place in this huge suburb. We started with orientation, everything was fine until the bond and connect. My introversion took a toll on me, and the nervousness of communicating with such a huge group forced me back to my comfort zone. I made a health excuse and left the place, thus skipping even the following day of orientation.",

Seeing everywhere apply at multiple places, I too applied for SPO and SnT, and guess what? Being a secretary was not as big of a deal as I thought it to be.",
      "First time an introvert got out of his little box was certainly overwhelming. Though I still couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear of speaking publicly, I did use this opportunity to gain much more than experience, a network of all these seniors and batchmates. With cold, wispy winter air came the buzz of Inter IIT Tech Meet. Shivam Singhal, a close senior, introduced me to it and suggested I prepare in advance for selection, and man, did it take more than just preparation. After facing multiple rejections, it was the Team Humanoid and Robo club that came to the surface and got me selected into JLR Mid Prep PS. Those 15 days of bunking in Hall-12 Robo club room (our new home on campus) with a bunch of us inexperienced 2nd years were all worthwhile, with the happiness I felt after seeing my visible contribution in the PS. The memories I made, the bonding I developed with the best Y20s and Y21s SnT ever had, and oh, not to forget, the celebration after achieving the gold medal, are still as fresh as new.",
      "As y‚Äôall would have already there‚Äôs always something happening on campus, if you are active enough. Thus, with the end of Inter-IIT, came soaring high dreams of multiple sophomores to stand in elections, and after initial doubts I was no exception. Giving wings to my dream, in one such Inter-IIT party hosted by Y19s and Y20s of JLR PS, in a totally unconscious state, I said and I quote ‚ÄúArnav, mujhe bhi gensec banna hai‚Äù. This was just a mere start of my seriousness and devotion toward council activities, without the slightest idea how it would become my whole identity. Can‚Äôt thank that one senior enough for motivating me enough to participate.",
      "",
      "But everything you desire requires sacrifice, hardwork and difficult decisions to be made, which eventually embarks us on the journey we are meant to be ( or what we think we are meant to be). One such decision, where I had to drop MSO201 after midsems in the most overwhelming 4th semester of EE, with too many doubts in my mind regarding the upcoming intern season, was one of those starting steps to the journey ahead.",
      "",
      "With summer came the passion to take up as many things as possible, projects under prof, summer projects mentoring, Summer course, and just to ice this whole cake up, acting general secretary for a month. Of course, my newly ignited council passion wasn‚Äôt going to die anyway soon. During the same time, I was running around the Admin offices, interacting with deans whose positions and their significance were way above my mind, managing SL booking, and came up with the idea of organising SnT‚Äôs first Tech Hackathon. Oh, did I forget to mention the intern prep in which I was lagging with no solid prior background in DSA of any kind? I was under the impression of learning new things every day I loved and which I did, but at the expense of my intern prep. If I could somehow turn back time, I would definitely rethink the duration for which the suffered intern prep could be compensated for.",
      "",
      "This summer felt like a storm I had willingly walked into. Between the projects, internship work, internship prep, Council work, mentoring for the summer project, and to top it all off‚Äîa summer course‚ÄîI was stretched beyond limits. There was barely a moment to breathe. Calls with family became infrequent, and my closest friends‚Äîthe people who had meant everything to me in college‚Äîstarted to feel distant. Not because I wanted that, but because I couldn‚Äôt keep up. I thought I could handle it all. Turns out, I was wrong.",
      "The summer passed in a blur, and before I could even process it, the intern season was at the doorstep. Thankfully, by then, I had covered DSA and probability & stats thoroughly. I was somewhat confident. The OPCs, whom I met during my CoCo period, hinted at the shortlisting of the techno-managerial and consulting roles by looking at my profile. Given my past experiences, I genuinely thought I‚Äôd at least land a shortlist in the techno-managerial domain.",
      "But no‚Äînothing. Not a single shortlist, except a random shortlist (yeah, that‚Äôs what various major banks and MnCs do). No shortlists for the roles I had prepared for, not even from the software and banking firms for whom I‚Äôd painstakingly completed every test. One after another, rejections piled up like unanswered questions. It was exactly 10 days after Day 1 that finally two shortlists came my way‚ÄîOracle IndiaandBarclays India. I wasn‚Äôt too keen on the SDE path and was genuinely hopeful about Barclays‚Äîit felt aligned with what I wanted. But fate had its own plans. The Oracle interview was scheduled a day before Barclays. I knew I had one shot. That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep. I packed my bag, skipped breakfast, and walked into the Tutorial Block that morning with nerves and caffeine in equal measure. Dozens of students were already there. I waited patiently, anxiously, as nearly 40 candidates were interviewed before I got my chance.",
      "And then, something just clicked. Maybe it was my survival instinct, or maybe all the pain and pressure just melted into clarity. But in that room, I was at my sharpest.Three rounds‚Äîeach one smoother than the last. I didn‚Äôt fumble. I didn‚Äôt doubt. I simply performed. For the first time in weeks, I felt in control again.",
      "During the intern season, the most disheartening thing for me how my resume pointers‚Äîsomething I had worked so hard on in the summers‚Äîdidn‚Äôt help me score at all. Not once was I asked about it, not even in Oracle. Every round boiled down to dry technical questions. Then came Round 3‚Äîthe manager round at Oracle. This time I expressed myself who I really was. I spoke about my extra-curriculars, my passion for leadership, and desire to pursue a managerial position while taking up the leadership role. The interviewer actuallyseemed impressed. But for god‚Äôs sake was it of no use. They had already picked 12 candidates (the number they promised SPO). I returned to my room crushed, trying to keep it together while my wingies tried to console me.",
      "And then‚Äîding. A mail. Recruited by Oracle India. Wait‚Ä¶ WTF just happened?!",
      "Turns out, two of the initial offers were revoked. They ended up offering the internship to me and one other person. Ta-da, suddenly I was on cloud nine.",
      "Intern season did more than just give me an internship‚Äîit was a reality check. It showed me who genuinely stood by me and who were just around for their own convenience. I drifted away from friends I was once really close with. If only I had stayed grounded, maybe those friendships wouldn‚Äôt have needed repair in the semesters that followed.",
      "Burnout hit me hard over the next 3-4 months. I was emotionally drained, and¬† just wanted to escape‚Äîfrom college, from the toxicity, from everything. I stopped interacting with most of my batchmates, especially the ones from batti. It felt like I was slowly disappearing from the very circle that once felt like home.",
      "I started spending almost all my time at the Electronics Club‚Äîeither brainstorming new initiatives or simply chilling and chatting with mybacchas(secretaries). This was, hands down, the most wholesome position I held in my four years at IITK with no pressure, no burden‚Äîjust pure involvement and joy. I grew so close to all of them that it started feeling like my own separate family where I was their bada bhai, sharing our life pieces, doing random backchodi and of course the club work. Beyond work, the movie nights, Diwali celebrations, and endlessbullasessions kept me hooked on. They gave me something to look forward to. And as a bonus, the club‚Äôs performance and reception on campus improved significantly. Everything felt smooth. Organic. Happy.",
      "Then came Antaragni‚Äîand with it, a sudden surge of political undercurrents around the upcoming General Elections. Until then, I had stayed away from anything even remotely political because a senior once told me,‚ÄúSnT mein politics nahi chalti. That‚Äôs not our culture.‚Äù I held onto that.",
      "But now, out of nowhere, it was like a storm had hit. ‚ÄúBhai‚Äôs 2 Hall me collusion hogya, ab ye ye bhi jaaenge, isko is hall ke hec ka support h, usko is hall.‚Äù",
      "I was just standing there thinking‚ÄîSeriously? This is how it works?People I once believed would make great candidates simply backed out. That‚Äôs when it hit me: politics wasn‚Äôt just creeping in‚Äîit was taking over. Now after seeing everything in 4 years, I can easily affirm this bitter truth: to become an effective leader, you need both‚Äîthe will to work and the political instincts to survive. Lacking any one could bring a lot of instability in any council.",
      "I got serious about my preparation. Reaching out to seniors, trying to understand the landscape better, drawing a map of the people across batches whom I could possibly tap into later (let‚Äôs just say‚Äîthat‚Äôs a story for another day üòÇ).",
      "But due to the emergence of a dummy candidate from my hall and the usual pitiful hall-level political maneuvering, I decided to step back from the General Elections. Instead, I shifted focus to Inter-IIT high prep PS this time and secondly, the Winter Camp, which a few Y21s and I revamped, pushing it into the core team spotlight.",
      "Through a combination of teamwork and a bit of luck, our problem statement earned a gold medal‚Äîmarking my second Tech Meet gold. In that moment, the sense of accomplishment felt especially genuine, and I was quietly glad to have avoided the election whirlwind.",
      "Right after the Inter-IIT contention meet in Madras, a few close seniors asked if I wasreallysure about stepping away and how I might regret it later. I just smiled and replied, ‚ÄúKaam hi toh karna hai, ISec jaaunga‚Ä¶ wahan election ka dekh lena aap sab üòÇ .‚Äù",
      "By then, my mind was already made up. Of course, things took an unexpected turn on January 5th, nomination day for GE‚Äô24. I‚Äôll leave those details for another time‚Äîbut they did change the course of my college journey.",
      "That day, I chose a side. And from there on, I threw myself headfirst into Students‚Äô Gymkhana politics. For the next 20 days, I spent most of my time at Hall 5‚Äôs I-Mid, especially Prakhar bhai ka room, with every plan, every meeting, every idea, a lot new memories and connections were brewed there. Going along with Dhruv & others almost all the time‚Äîcampaigning, strategizing, sitting across hostels with different people. And somewhere in the chaos‚Ä¶ I started to enjoy it.",
      "",
      "The same politics I had kept myself away from‚Äîso consciously, even for the sake of my ambitions‚Äîwas now becoming something Igenuinelyenjoyed. It was about the people, bonds, and a sense of purpose.",
      "",
      "Within just a week of GE‚Äô24 ending, the nominations for Institute Secretary were out. And even before I could soak in the aftermath of the elections, I had already received asoftNOTA threat and little resistance due to my recent involvements as well as actions.",
      "And then came D-Day. Despite all odds, I got elected‚Äîwith an 18-4 vote from the council. It was the first time I ever presented in front of so many people in my life and realised how important role communication can play.",
      "Over time, I became deeply familiar‚Äîalmost too familiar‚Äîwith the student politics: collusions, dummy candidates, covert recordings, betrayals. Thatnaiveversion of me? Long gone. Instead of being disgusted, I got more drawn in and wanted to be present. Gymkhana wasn‚Äôt just a thing to me anymore‚Äîit felt personal.",
      "All the ambition I thought I had lost urged me more to fulfill my responsibility.",
      "I started working on everything I had proposed and from that, came some of the most impactful external collaborations I‚Äôve ever been a part of.¬† Working withUP Police, cold-reaching out to multiple startups for partnerships in HackIITK, all these efforts meant something and I finally got what I wanted, Networking with Alumni, Startups & great minds outside.",
      "And just when you thought this chapter was all about politics and councils?",
      "Nope.",
      "All the days I spent with Chitresh and Patil (divyansh), they supported me all the time, taking care of me like their own brother (and damn, they are my own brother). How can one forget Hall-3 F block, my room F267, the place I liked most in the entire campus. That room and those roommates will never go out of my memory. All the time spent with them 2 (& my wingies), all the nights we simply stargazed from F block rooftop, is the most valuable thing I have in this academic year of 2023-24.",
      "",
      "The 6th semester also gave me something I didn‚Äôt even know I needed‚Äîrekindled friendships. The people I‚Äôd slowly drifted from during intern season found their way back into my life. From a random, spontaneous plan to Ayodhya to watching an IPL match in Lucknow‚Äî(and making Ridin realize how good the place near Ekana Stadium actually is)‚Äîit was wholesome. Full circle.‚Äô",
      "",
      "It was a strange, beautiful transition‚Äîfrom being a little innocent guy who hated politics‚Äîto getting knee-deep in the dirt‚Ä¶ and genuinelylikingit.",
      "",
      "As for Summer ‚Äô24 and my time in Bangalore? Let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ skip that chapter.",
      "Fast forward three months‚Äîhere I am, back home after wrapping up my internship at Oracle, waiting anxiously for the PPO result with uncertainty about even accepting it. The thought of balancing placement prep, 65 credits (thanks to the three courses I had dropped earlier), council work, and Inter-IIT responsibilities felt overwhelming. After a lot of back and forth, I decided to accept the PPO‚Äîand with that, shifted my focus completely away from placement.",
      "",
      "7th semester, the toughest phase of college ‚Äì academics, career, personal life, and professional commitments‚Äîall came crashing down in waves.I began the semester with Tech Sprint, gearing up for Inter IIT. We aimed to cover almost every domain. It quickly became clear how much we lacked in several areas. Every task I took on felt heavier than it should have, mostly because of my packed schedule. Still, I somehow kept things afloat‚Äîat the cost of my classes (all thanks to Ridin for covering my assignments).Things went relatively smoothly‚Ä¶ until mid-September, when CL nominations arrived. Once again, politics stirred. The same frustrating questions resurfaced: Do egos matter more than service to the college? Where is the line between fairness and favoritism? It was draining.",
      "Amid this, I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to the Gymkhana stakeholders and the friends who stood by me. But the timing couldn‚Äôt have been worse‚Äîthis all blew up right around midsems. Add to that some already ongoing personal struggles, and suddenly the one thing I had been most passionate about became a source of emotional anxiety..The fallout, you ask? My midsems took a hit, and I had to drop my fourth and final course‚ÄîTheory of Computation. And just like that, I missed out on completing one of my minors.",
      "Somehow, after nearly a week of intense discussions, negotiations, and closed-door conversations, things finally got sorted. I was back in it‚Äîthe very thing I had almost thought to walk away from. There was a moment when I was so disgusted, but I got back to the grind to adhere to my sanity.",
      "Next up was attending the first offline Tech Board Meet, representing IIT Kanpur at IIT Bombay. Aligning with the Council Core Team and Tech Sprint mentors, mapping out strategies to tackle all the problem statements, managing the heaps of administrative work, and looking after the entire contingent, everything was smoothly working out.",
      "We practically lived in the Senate Hall and DJAC, nights blended into days. And right there, beside me always, were Mohika and Anunay. This phase was the most emotionally charged part of my college life; everything I had done, everything I had pushed through, culminated here.",
      "An amazing team‚ÄîAnunay, Mohika & me‚Äîworking with insane synergy, but not everything was smooth sailing.As for the results? They didn‚Äôt land in our favor. And honestly, that deserves an entirely separate article. But even then, I walked away with a ton of positives, the dedication from the contingent, especially the current and incoming core teams, was truly unmatched. I still remember the sleepless nights, living on barely 3 hours of sleep, day after day, for like a month and a half. Mornings spent running around the DoSA office, evenings to late nights consumed in Senate Hall/DJAC. It was relentless.But in that chaos, I grew. I became more responsible, more mature, more confident. I learned what it meant to carry a team, not just logistically, but emotionally. Of course, this came at a cost‚Äîmy health took a massive hit. But looking back, I wouldn‚Äôt trade those moments for anything.The time after the Inter-IIT contention meet and the result announcement was the first time in a very long while that I cried. It wasn‚Äôt just disappointment‚Äîit was heartbreak. The countless hours, the sleepless nights, the sheer grind put in by not just the three of us, but by the entire contingent‚Ä¶ it all felt like it vanished in a moment.",
      "In the thick humidity of Bombay, we‚ÄîMohika, Anunay, and I‚Äîstepped off campus. There were tears in our eyes, heaviness in our hearts, and disappointment written all over our faces while inhaling that cigarette, as the wind passed me, so did a wave of realizations, regrets, and what-ifs, that was my personal ‚ÄúKhada hoon aaj bhi wahi‚Äù moment.",
      "Leading this contingent was, without question, the thing I am most proud of in my four years at IITK. And it shattered. It shattered in a way I hadn‚Äôt prepared for. I kept asking myself‚Äîwhere did we go wrong? When we got back to the room, I couldn‚Äôt even gather the strength to face my own team and break the news.",
      "But then‚Äîsomething unexpected happened. I saw the Y22s. The way they carried themselves in that moment‚Äîwith maturity, resilience, and quiet determination‚Äîmoved me. Each PS lead wasn‚Äôt demoralized. In fact, they were more motivated than ever. That night, I addressed the entire contingent before the networking dinner, and what I saw in their eyes, especially from the Y22s and Y23s, was fire.I hope they carry that spirit forward. That culture.And just like that‚Ä¶ enough of SnT. Let‚Äôs rewind to the final year‚Äîto theBakchod Block of Hall 1.Officially, I was allotted B-top. But practically, I lived in B-mid, my pseudo-room B205, with Ishan Saxena, mera bhai jaisa dost. It‚Äôs wild to think I barely knew 5‚Äì6 people in that wing earlier, and yet, by the end of August, we were a full-blown family. We went on wing outings, pulled countless night-outs, and had some legendary sessions (iykyk). Then came Antaragni, followed by Ritviz Pronite. The memories hit hard, especially with the realization that this was the last one together. We enjoyed every second‚Äîso much so, I honestly don‚Äôt even remember Day 4. üòÑBy then, the placement wave had already begun. A quiet panic had taken over the campus. Friends were getting offers left and right, and every acceptance felt surreal, bringing relief and joy. Especially when you‚Äôve already pre-booked your trip with those very friends, who were sitting for placements!And then came the crown jewel of it all. After the Cult Meet, just before New Year, we flew off to Vietnam, my first college trip (too late but too good), and also my first international trip.",
      "It‚Äôs hard to put into words what that trip meant. Maybe some things are best left unwritten. But one thing I know for sure: I‚Äôll carry that journey with me for life.",
      "",
      "As the final semester began, our only aim was to make as many memories as possible. From dancing in DE‚Äô25 with my wingies‚Äîsomething I never imagined myself doing‚Äîto participating in Galaxy one last time, I‚Äôll miss going down almost every day, seeing juniors pouring their hearts into practice, planning, and prepping, Whether it was the last fest, those spontaneous chill nights, or just rejoicing with friends one last time, somewhere along the way, I made peace. Peace with a few regrets, a few missed goals, and a few dreams that didn‚Äôt quite land the way I‚Äôd imagined. But in letting go of some of those targets, I ended up discovering parts of myself I never knew existed. I explored things I would have never dared to even think of when I first walked into this campus.",
      "",
      "It‚Äôs way too hard to even express in words what all time I spent with all of them, all the talks, a lot of bakchodi, a lot of emotional talk, and tons of memories. I am certainly sure I met the best people and I am grateful for such an experience. Maybe only a gallery could express it a bit but all those uncaptured moments, only residing in our memory is the best takeaway from my college life and this is what I will cherish always.",
      "",
      "That shy teenager, filled with doubts and second-guessing every move‚Ä¶ is now leaving as someone who‚Äôs far from perfect, but confident enough‚Äîto make decisions, to face uncertainties, and to embrace the unknown. Of course, there are so many friends, mentors, and juniors who haven‚Äôt been named here‚Äîbut each of them has left an imprint on my journey and I‚Äôll be forever grateful for all that I could from them.",
      "So, how would I rate my college life? Honestly, I don‚Äôt care. Because not everything went according to the plan, I may have missed a few targets, dropped a few balls, or even lost some things I thought were important‚Ä¶ but I grew.I grew into someone who‚Äôs ready to face the real world. Someone who knows how to take a step forward, even in uncertainty. Someone who trusts himself. Someone who has friends who he can rely on.And maybe, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. So here‚Äôs to the journey ahead‚Äîwhatever it may hold.The road continues. And this time, I‚Äôm not afraid to walk it.",

      "In this 28th edition of As We Leave, Sai Praneeth Donthu, a Y21 from the Department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, looks back at a life shaped by sweltering summers, late-night walks, and the quiet company of a crow outside Hall 9. His journey was never linear ‚Äî more a janky cassette of scattered memories than a clean arc. From pandemic dormancy to chaotic sprints, from cynicism to deep care, from floating through mistakes to finding stillness, each semester added a glitchy, beautiful note.",
      "This AWL is a tribute to misplaced photos, half-spoken goodbyes, and the bittersweet comfort of knowing that not remembering everything doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt¬†shape¬†you.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "There are ever so many ways to write a memoir of one‚Äôs own youthful escapades into the newly found freedom that college so readily provides. It definitely is a stretch to call my experiences as ‚Äúescapades‚Äù per se, but I might as well give myself the license to lie and exaggerate the grandeur of the life I lived here. Being honest, the only person who would like that version would be my younger pubescent self stuck up in my room in the peak of the pandemic. Of all the ways I could probably go about writing this, I think I‚Äôll choose a more colourful way; it‚Äôll probably be the closest to what my whole as a self went through in my overly imaginative head these past few years. Oh, it‚Äôll be heavily exaggerated and pretentious, so be warned, reader. No Tl;dr‚Äôs üòâ",
      "Four years of history hit me with stunning lucidity the moment I sat to write this, and ironically enough the words to describe them evade me. I‚Äôm done with my run here and I‚Äôll hate the fact that this history will wear down and age as I keep reminiscing and jumping at the same highlights time and again. Where and how do we start from here? Where do we go from here? These questions have been answered by those who came before in their own ways and no doubt I‚Äôll find my own but it fascinates me that such questions are perennial. Maybe that‚Äôs a reason why we have such a thing asAWL‚Äôs‚Äì because we have our own twist on such questions that keep testing each generation and challenges us to search for the perspective that nevertheless defines us. For now though I‚Äôd rather focus on one question ‚Äì How do I start thisAWL?",
      "The first and most prominent thing I will forever remember about the campus is the heat and the summers. I remember the charcoal breath that hit my face as I stepped out of the airplane, the first time I landed in Kanpur. It therefore goes without saying that I hate the summers in this city; I‚Äôm more of a winter guy. And yet as I leave, the last summer feels a tad bit more nostalgic than the long gone winter. While the winters have been more serene and calm with not much to do but hibernate with a nice book in hand, the summers have been chaotic and unruly, bringing out the scintillating colours of everyday life in the campus. I hate the summers in this city, but I‚Äôve grown all the more fond of it for all the colours that light up the campus as soon as the first signs of spring arrive. The variety of flowers I‚Äôve seen are just not found in the city from where I hail from. Countless days of cycling towards classes in a shower of leaves and petals shook from the light wind of spring only cement this memory. If you know me, you know that I love flowers.",
      "I‚Äôve also grown fond of the memories of the many summer nights which only twinkled with the stars above and the light from mischievous eyes embroiled in sophomore college drama. Those nights were filled with gossips underneath streetlights that flickered with the crowding pests. Those nights, we were the nuisance with our dope fuelled ruckus and music that unsettled the creatures of the night whose job it was to never let us sleep. Those were the initial nights that we spent running from campus end to campus end in search of ghosts, rooftops and promises made under an empty sky and an open heart. The absence of light only lets us fill the canvas of night with our own colour, such were those nights, now relics of a bygone era, an era of juvenility. Throughout all the dramas and the-not-so-very-complicated complications that college life later added to my life (which previously as a kid was just mundanity known between four walls and a playground), the only thing I wish to take away and remember is the bittersweet nostalgia held in the faces of close friends and in every green leaf and red brick of the campus.",
      "If you‚Äôre reading this, then you‚Äôre either someone who knows me, someone who is looking back into their pasts or someone who believes that they can see the future by readingAWL‚Äôs. I used to think that although we have the same four years, nothing and everything is nearly the same. Again goes back to what we started with; we all have our own twist to this thing. Makes it all the more beautiful.",
      "On one sweltering April day, perched atop a ledge, I noticed a crow. At a time, where most of the campus wildlife is usually cowering away in their dens and nests from the unforgiving sun, the crow seemed relentless in its posture. What caught my curiosity was the fact that I‚Äôve been noticing the same crow during the same hours of the day for weeks. This episode of college ends for me soon and in one way or another I feel that I can relate to the crow. In this fast-paced and competitive environment that our college unknowingly gives us, with months on end with no respite whatsoever, I often found myself perched upon my own ledge of comfort ‚Äì as I do even now. Unlike the majority of final year students who fight tooth and nail to get any available room in the prestigious rundown that is Hall 1, I preferred the relative peace and comfort of Hall 9. My room faced south, towards Hall 10 and 11, which meant that every evening during sunset, I used to be able to see the huge flock of crows, that the particular road to Mama Mios is known for, flying hither thither and cawing up a storm. It often served as a reminder to take a break for me and at which time I‚Äôd look outside and count all the crows I could until I got bored or fell asleep at my desk.",
      "There was a massive rainstorm the other morning and ever since then I‚Äôve stopped seeing that crow and now whenever I look out my window at sunset, I try, in a flash of senseless stupidity, to catch a glimpse of that crow. Wonder where it is now.",
      "These memories of crows and flowers come from a place of nostalgia. I‚Äôve never questioned the role that nostalgia has played in my life but the weight of it has grown stronger. I‚Äôve started to feel a bit resentful of it ‚Äì It has always treated me unfairly. I guess the colour we give to those black and white days, the way we romanticize them and make way around all our bad decisions and mistakes feels unfaithful to my past self that went through it. The bitterness laced in these feelings isn‚Äôt so subtly hidden.",
      "Under duress of my own conscience, I will have to admit that I‚Äôve become a bitter person. ‚ÄúAll happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way‚Äù is the opener ofAnna KareninabyLeo Tolstoy. I‚Äôve always been aware and kinda obsessed with the life and times ofTolstoyever since as a kid I watched Charlie search for a book named ‚ÄúLeo‚Äôs Toystore‚Äù by ‚ÄúWarren Piece‚Äù (which is whatCharlie mistook for the famousWar And PeacebyLeo Tolstoy) from ‚ÄúThe Peanuts Movie‚Äù which was based on the celebrated comic strip. As a content kid with no more to ask but for the latest hot wheels car or the TV remote, it never struck me as it does to me now. We all suffer in our own pools of self-doubt, misgivings, and consequences to our actions and we all try to jump out. Maybe we need to start by learning to swim. Both literally and figuratively, I‚Äôve only ever managed to float.",
      "I prefer the solace of my own room these days rather than the more crowded areas of the campus. It comes from a place of understanding and whatever little maturity I hope to have gained over the course of the last year. We‚Äôve all been naive when we‚Äôve entered college and seen the sprawling acres of red and green for the first time, bubbling with buoyant excitement and floating to make friends with every last person. And as the years pass, some people do manage to maintain every single relationship despite the dramas, but I for one feel that I‚Äôve been able to see both the best sides of people and also the most horrible ones. No wonder we prefer animals and dogs.",
      "Clearly I‚Äôve changed. I‚Äôm not the old version of me from my first year who was overly cautious and scared, who thought twenty times as if a late night walk in the nighttime heat would over dehydrate me. Do I like the version of me that I‚Äôve become?",
      "I must admit that I‚Äôve very clearly demonstrated that I may have symptoms of ADHD in the way I have gone about writing the AWL but bear with me, I feel that that‚Äôs what college was to me ‚Äì a janky cassette tape with sporadic moments. Nothing was ever linear, time was always wonky, it was as if the bell tower rang at its own pace. On one hand there are some semesters that I can barely remember head or tail, whereas on the other there are others which are etched into my memory. An argument can be made that life in general works in the same way, but I felt that it was more noticeable to me with semesters which are quite short. Either way, forgive me for the horrible AWL I‚Äôve written.",
      "Take for instance my first semester at college, which due to the pandemic was cut short and squeezed into three months of online meets, countless co-op games and ever so little academics. We were fed a falsehood of college life which we knew at the time but all we could do was will the pandemic rates go down so that we could taste the real deal. Those days are vivid, despite the lack of activity beyond the desktop chair, for even though it was online, the essence of first year college life was to some extent felt through all the friends I‚Äôve made back then (and are still cheering each other on at the finish line). I would feel that we had gotten the very best ending to the online semester since we were greeted byRitviz, the very week we had come to campus and in a sudden instant we started to feel what real college felt like.",
      "And just like that ever since the fervor towards this newfound freedom to explore , connect and have fun vanished, the months and then the semesters began to merge into one continuous flow of lectures, exams and everything in between. Each of the following semesters that followed were not marked by the immature things that we did, the fests, the parties and what not, but rather surprisingly the littlest of events, be it in our jangled up routines, the courses that we took, or the friendships we took ever so granted. These moments, locked behind some forgotten gate, live a lonely existence in the thousands of photos we took of ordinary life which do not serve their intended purpose of bringing back memory but rather end up being deleted. Even now, as I scroll through the countless photos that eat away at my drive, I come across a motley of photos that I‚Äôm sure held some stupid meaning that I sorely wish to remember but only end up dumping them. I just hope those moments exist in time somewhere in some dimension far away that I can access and cherish.",
      "Recency bias plays a huge deal in this mismatched and inconsistent set of memories. The semesters toward the backend of college were more happening in general than those in the middle and I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way. All this has only made me conclude that we only remember the beginning and the ending of things and that in my opinion is the most unfair thing we can do to something that we claim to cherish as something that is life changing and central to our personality.",
      "Life here has been worth my heart that I can give regardless of all the forgotten memories, for they still have had an effect on me as a whole, now and forevermore.",
      "The counselling service made us take a piece of paper with our ranks written on it and burn it up in our first year. This was supposed to ingrain in us the fact that our ranks ,and metrics decided by some test, do not matter. I guess they need to tell us, the last years‚Äô, to do the same thing but now with our CPI‚Äôs; after all it too is a metric. For all the symbolism and all it‚Äôs worth with its deep meaning or whatever it all feels very shallow when you realise that the same people who serve this gyaan to unsuspecting juniors are the same bunch of people who‚Äôd do anything to get a higher grade.",
      "The definitions of life, achievements and success grew a new dimension the moment I stepped into college. All of a sudden I was not only bad in one thing but now I was bad in a multitude of things. All of a sudden I did not know what I wanted ‚Äì the freedom of the careless moon, or the discipline beneath the watchful sun. People often quote that the‚ÄúJack of all trades is the master of none‚Äùbut nine out of ten people forget that he/she is still‚Äúoftentimes better than the master of one‚Äù.I‚Äôm no sort of enlightened saint, rather a hypocrite myself. I‚Äôve always believed that the rat race is never worth it ‚Äì but at the end of the day I‚Äôve always run behind CPI, placement and all those other things. It‚Äôs a heavy expense that I had to pay for this.",
      "And at what expense? The expense I had to pay for not being genuine to myself in this journey was the foot of failure on my face time and again. All of a sudden life was never about working hard enough and you‚Äôll get it but it now was work hard and true to yourself and you might get it.",
      "Does this mean that I‚Äôve changed? Nope, not at all. I‚Äôm a hypocrite, like the rest of us. At Least I have no regrets.",
      "Being grateful for the life I‚Äôve been giving and the circumstances that led me to this very instance somehow does not feel sufficient to clear the debt that I owe. They say that an IIT is an IIT for its people; now that the campus is getting more and more desolate and the wildlife is being spotted again, it feels less and less like home. I don‚Äôt hate it though, I can re-explore the place one last time, from the sunsets on top of hall 10 to the desolate forestry just beyond the old shop, on my own terms. All I need are the songs attached to the night and the memories I so long to revisit and the shoes of Hermes to flit past the SIS guards to places I‚Äôm not allowed to visit. Like the 7th floor of the residential apartments! Do go there, you‚Äôll find a staircase that starts and leads to nowhere.",
      "Time deceives us and we never realise how much one changes, but photos and videos never do. I too have changed throughout the years. The bangalore accent that I used to be proud of has eroded away to a tongue that speaks a more northern accent. No one back home recognises me anymore; each time I‚Äôve gone back it‚Äôs a whole new person they see stepping into the house. It‚Äôs the people here that‚Äôve been responsible, and they have my thanks. I come from Bangalore, a mixing pot of a city, a city from where I‚Äôve met people from multiple cultures and speak different languages and therefore when I came here, I was under the false impression that I would be comfortable with people here in Kanpur. What I had failed to understand was that the people I had often interacted with are from the same shared background unlike those I was about to meet.",
      "I‚Äôve come across such a plethora of wonderful people and at the same time have come across horrible people. Both have done a great deal of justice to the claim thatan IIT is an IIT for its people. Both have made a portrait of me that I will live only to cherish if not for anything else.",
      "The topic of friends is probably one of the hardest things that I can think about, not because some friends have come and gone or some have left a bad taste or that some have just drifted apart, visible only at the far horizon. Rather it‚Äôs in knowing that there probably was something more you could have done or said, something different. Writing about all of them is only cementing the fact that it‚Äôs all done and dusted and you ought to let go now and let them go on their own paths. Writing about them only freezes them in this particular instant, which only puts more importance to each little word, verb and adjective you use. After all, college is all and only about the friends you make.",
      "What words do I choose then? Giving any words as such grossly simplifies the way I feel towards some people. Do I throw praises, or verses rhyming from the book of a poet, or perhaps take individually name and fame them? This comes from a place of deep emotions, and for this moment I will let them talk about the way I feel for emotions are at the core of what makes us feel. If the campus and life had any colour, then these people gave it the vibrance. Thanks for each and every word and moment that you all felt was a good idea to spend with me.",
      "It‚Äôs going to be hard to leave. That bit is for sure.",
      "I‚Äôve come to the end of my line here, I feel aged and I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôve crossed over into old age already. I can already feel my knees cracking and my cataract thickening. The longer I stay here, the more my bed feels comfier and my eyes feel foggier. I‚Äôve said all my thank yous and goodbyes, I‚Äôve cried my share of tears, I‚Äôve hugged all the people that matter to me and made peace with all the unfinished dramas and I‚Äôve settled all my emotional and actual dues. What else is left?",
      "In the end it‚Äôs not a teary eyed goodbye to this life here, but rather a melancholic one. Some people would wish to have apensieveto visit all the good times, but I‚Äôd rather not. The reality of things is oftentimes much less enjoyable to reminisce on than what nostalgia gives us and I‚Äôm content with that. I‚Äôm sure to forget all the things that I wish not to, but it is the way it is. I‚Äôm content. We all know how this story ends, but we are so sorely underprepared for when it ends. Here‚Äôs to all the words that went unsaid, here‚Äôs to all the laughter that we never had, here‚Äôs to all the things we never did.",
      "Here‚Äôs also to the full stop to end it all. It‚Äôs a pretty heavy one. Weight of a hundred million seconds.",

      "In this 27th edition of As We Leave, Pankajh Jhamtani ,a Y21 student from the Department of Statistics and Data Science, retraces his meticulously layered and emotionally charged journey.From remote Zoom orientations to leading one of the most demanding roles on campus, from heartbreaks during intern season to a walk-in dream placement, his narrative captures the raw beauty of community, perseverance, and growth. Whether it was ALs, coaching friends who never gave up, CTM interviews , or spontaneous trips and deep conversations outside CS, each moment was a hidden weight in his final model. This AWL is a tribute to a journey shaped by conviction, recalibration, relentless care, and the ever-burning drive to¬†keep¬†becoming.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "My Class 8 teacher once wrote on my report card: ‚ÄúSincere child, can do better.‚ÄùThe only thing that has changed since then is that I‚Äôm no longer a child. I always do what I think I am supposed to do. So here I am, writing this As We Leave piece. Because I suppose graduating folks are supposed to write something, to pass on a few things and to leave behind a story of what these years meant (maybe read it sometime in the future during nostalgic trips).",
      "Perhaps I‚Äôll structure this story like an ML model (maybe I did learn something from studying data science for four years). So here‚Äôs how I explored various ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô, got into training loops (learning and failing), and tuned to something better.",
      "Thank you, Riddhi, for keeping so much patience with me while I procrastinated writing this and structured it in a complicated manner!",
      "I grew up idolising my older brother at IIT Roorkee. As a school kid, I saw his life, which looked pretty great, internships, placements, papers published, well-paying jobs, etc. To me, IIT was a great shortcut to a comfortable future. So I decided to pursue the IIT dream. Before this,¬† I was the ‚Äúsincere‚Äù type-happy with 80% marks. The IIT buzz changed me, and suddenly, all the hard work started.",
      "COVID was the random seed in my initialisation. With boards cancelled, JEE preparation became manageable. But college began remotely. Though my campus was just six kilometres from home, it felt worlds apart, accessible only through a screen in those initial months.",
      "My college life began in breakout rooms and Zoom calls‚Äîlogging into orientation, late-night Smash Karts tournaments, branch meets, bulla sessions, and even a virtual fresher‚Äôs dance. Academics felt surprisingly manageable (iykyk), and the online setup made the transition feel easier.",
      "Online had some silver linings; I stayed close to family and maintained strong ties with my coaching friends‚Äîa bond I‚Äôll revisit later. Yet, the novelty of online college soon faded, leaving me yearning for the IIT Kanpur I had envisioned. When COVID cases dipped, we organised a small ‚ÄòKanpur meet,‚Äô and I even visited campus with an alumnus. The real magic, however, unfolded when the long-awaited email arrived: we were finally going offline.",
      "Stepping onto campus was surreal. Meeting my baapu Sarthak, roommate Ayush, exploring the campus, wing guitar seshs (thanks to Rohan), celebrating birthdays, attending my first offline concert with wingmates, and experiencing in-person orientation‚Äîit was the college life I had dreamt of. Naturally, this shift introduced challenges. My midsem grades slipped as I grappled with balancing exploration and academics. I joined the dance club as a secy and participated in events, only to realise the toll on my health. Yet, those late-night practices, exhausted laughs, and 6 am run-throughs will remain cherished memories.",
      "Simultaneously, I began exploring other avenues. I joined Techkriti as a Senior Executive and BCS as a secy. It was a Stamatics project that sparked my curiosity in machine learning (ML), and BCS fueled that interest. Though my role at BCS taught me little directly, it exposed me to fascinating concepts, inspiring me to dive into projects, courses, online resources, and a UGP in later years. All this led me to a really ‚Äòdeep‚Äô craze of ML.",
      "Around then, I also explored the Counselling Service. I applied to be a Student Guide, thinking it was all about fun during orientation and connecting with juniors. But the SG interview was a wake-up call. During the roleplay, I was faced with the kinds of real problems freshers might struggle with. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it helped me see myself‚Äîand CS‚Äîin a new light. That experience planted a seed for something much bigger later.",
      "In machine learning, every forward pass takes inputs, processes them through the network, and produces an output. Every semester felt like a new forward pass‚Äîlearning from previous mistakes and trying to optimise for better results.",
      "After my EDA phase, I identified the key features to focus on: academics, meaningful relationships, and finding my true calling. I decided to leave the dance club, redirecting my energy toward my studies, health, my role at BCS, and tried to fix my sleep schedule(Still working on it).",
      "Moving to Hall 5 marked a new epoch. The SG workshops began reshaping my understanding of what CS truly meant. Those sessions taught me that empathy isn‚Äôt just a nice-to-have quality‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for meaningful human connection. I learned to listen without judging or fixing and to be truly present. The workshop training days were transformative, and as an AM/SG, I experienced the beautiful side of CS‚Äîthe genuine care and the quiet fulfilment of helping someone. Guiding my Bache and wing Bache, each with their unique stories and struggles, helped me feel something different.",
      "This understanding of support, reinforced by unwavering support that I got, especially from my coaching friends (more on it later), inspired me to apply to be a CTM. The interview was intense, confronting my thought process and perspectives, but I made it through, and suddenly I was part of something bigger than myself.",
      "Juggling a demanding CTM schedule alongside repairing strained friendships and preparing for internships during my second-year summers felt like training multiple models at once. Though exhausting, at least the summer allowed me to mend bonds and contribute to a memorable fresher‚Äôs orientation, if not a good internship.",
      "Loss function in an ML model quantifies how far the model‚Äôs output is from the real output. So here I‚Äôll talk about a few things that disappointed me in my college life.",
      "With a CPI below 8, belonging to a new branch (Statistics and Data Science, SDS), pursuing a BS program, lacking adequate coding preparation, and insisting on tech or ML roles, the internship drive was an uphill battle. The exhaustion from orientation didn‚Äôt help. I even missed one internship test during orientation just because mai line mae ‚Äúgap cover kara raha tha.‚Äù Seeing peers secure internships while I struggled, hit harder than expected. Though genuinely happy for them, self-doubt consumed me. Nights spent crying in my room, imagining worst-case scenarios, tested my resilience.",
      "I did give a few interviews, but couldn‚Äôt crack any initially. I pushed myself, eventually raising my CPI above 8 in the fifth semester. On January 16, I secured an off-campus internship offer, though delays in receiving the offer letter kept me anxious. I continued applying elsewhere, landing a remote on-campus ML internship¬† on February 20. I accepted the offer because I never got the offer letter for the first one. The role was of my liking but I didn‚Äôt like working remotely with a low stipend. Though it was not what I imagined, it restored my confidence. Yet, I knew I had to work harder for placements.",
      "Even CS had its downsides. While my CTM tenure was mostly great, there were some points where I would not like CS or me being in CS. I spent less time on academics, coding, and socialising with friends, though I did forge new bonds within the CS. The role demanded so much that personal and professional priorities sometimes took a backseat.",
      "The beauty of neural networks lies in backpropagation‚Äîlearning from errors and adjusting weights to minimise future loss. In this section, I‚Äôll talk about the few things that I got the chance to improve.",
      "Intern season was a wake-up call. I really did not want my placements to suffer because of anything. Since the remote internship wasn‚Äôt much of a burden, I started improving on things related to placement prep immediately. I took light courses for the 7th semester and utilised the summers to learn coding. I had my closest friends (ALs) with me in the 7th semester, helping me at every point of the placement journey from the start of the 7th semester to 1st December. I was able to prepare for the placements properly because I was preparing with them. Everyone, like my coaching friends and my family, constantly checked up on me and supported me. I also prepared with better resources and covered things I couldn‚Äôt during the intern drive. Finally, all the efforts paid off, and I got a better placement than I imagined for myself.",
      "Beyond career growth, I nurtured personal connections. I invested time in rebuilding friendships, cherishing everyday conversations, card games, late-night walks, concerts, shared meals, and spontaneous food orders.",
      "On February 23, an email from our CS coordinators urged us to consider applying for the coordinator role. Before the 20th, I didn‚Äôt have an internship, and I was very sure that I wouldn‚Äôt apply for this position. I just felt that I should spend more time focusing on my career. But after the 20th, I was a bit confused, and some of my co-team members, especially Sanchit, asked me to talk about it with my coordinators to make an informed decision. My friends were also divided in their opinions about my application. I did sacrifice my time with them for CS in my ctm tenure. I had my placement prep, academics, wanted to enjoy my last year in college, wanted to spend time with my friends, and my real sister‚Äôs wedding was in December. My mom‚Äôs advice shifted my perspective. She reminded me that life often demands juggling multiple roles, urging me to embrace the challenge if I felt passionate. Inspired, I applied for the coordinator position, promising myself that I would not let CS affect my placement prep, my relationships, and my little brother‚Äôs duties for my sister‚Äôs wedding. I kept my promise and had a much better CS tenure.",
      "Regularisation includes all the things that prevent a model from overfitting. For me, it includes everything in my life that kept me sane in this emotional rollercoaster of life.",
      "From the beginning, I struggled to find a friend group where I truly felt I belonged. I had a good bond with my roommate and his friends, but something felt amiss. One random evening, seven of us wingies went out for a movie. On the way back, a classic bitching session turned into a WhatsApp group, leading to a potential college waala group. Well, the loss function measuring mismatched vibes was still too high. An epoch later, the group converged to a perfect set of 7 friends. We moved together to our new wing (B-mid) in H5 in the third year, and then to H1 (D Top). Rohan, Aayushman, Rachit, Chetanya, Akshay, & Sahaj became my family at IITK. Whether it was during the placement grind, intern drive, or just low (or high) days, everything was great because of them. They have always been there for me, and it‚Äôs really difficult to imagine that they will not be there in adjacent rooms. We also did the mandatory Goa trip together. I will really miss bullying them, get bullied, some dark humor, hanging out in D319, some random singing, giving and getting advice on weird shit, making bets, deep convos, TT matches, hanging out in canteen, and what not. Life without them toh ‚Äòmushkil hi hai‚Äô.",
      "Thanks to the online semester, I stayed closely connected with my coaching friends. They visited often, we ordered food for each other, I sneaked them into fests, danced at concerts, and made some unforgettable memories. But not everything is rosy. At the start of my second year, something felt off. I can‚Äôt exactly describe it‚Äîacademics felt heavier than they should, friendships became complicated, and I wasn‚Äôt in the right space. All this chaos sometimes slipped as rage or frustration, hurting these long-distance friendships.",
      "It‚Äôs hard to realise you‚Äôre going through something while you‚Äôre in it. I didn‚Äôt trust anyone in college enough to open up, and I didn‚Äôt share much with family either, mostly because I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening myself. What helped me stay afloat were the frequent visits home and, most importantly, my coaching friends. Even though I lashed out at times, they didn‚Äôt give up on me. They helped me make sense of it all. It did damage my friendship with them, but we rebuilt everything really well. That‚Äôs what matters‚Äîwhen people don‚Äôt give up on you. Even though they weren‚Äôt a part of IITK, they were an integral part of my college ‚ÄòRegularisation‚Äô kit, and they will always hold a special place in my life.",
      "ICS gave me a lot of things, but the thing I‚Äôll cherish the most will be the friends I made. There have been some people who are the easiest people to open up to. And by people all the teams that I have interacted with, Y20, Y21, & Y22. I‚Äòll always remember all the deep convos we had in the CS office (and the road outside). I‚Äôll always remember all the times they did things for me without showing that they did a favour. I‚Äôll especially remember the times I spent with JaSBAAein (our coordi pen name: Jhamtani, Sanchit, Bajaj, Amay, & Aashika aka PAPAS). I‚Äôll be indebted to ICS forever because it gave me such wonderful people in my life. I‚Äôll miss all the bitching sessions, panic nights, very very long discussions, cs office waale deep convos, and organising some of the best events together. Kudos to Santanu sir who made ics easier than what it was.",
      "Being part of the first batch of the Statistics and Data Science (SDS) program felt special. We were only 32 students, but my branchmates were some of the really great people I found in this college.¬† We also had some of the most dedicated professors‚ÄîProf. Dootika Vats, Prof. Arnab Hazra, and more, who made the learning journey worthwhile. Not only was the course content so great, but it was also very relevant that some of it was directly asked in placement interviews.",
      "Of course, not everything was smooth. Some courses were rough, sometimes because we were the pilot batch and sometimes because of my own mistakes. But overall, the SDS experience was rich and rewarding. I attended almost 80% of the classes (with or without attendance) till the 6th semester (yes, I was that person) because I genuinely found the content exciting‚Äîsometimes even like JEE days!",
      "SDS also gave me some amazing people. I made two sisters, Lakshika and Vanshika, without whose notes my degree would have been impossible. From pulling all-nighters on assignments to rage-dropping courses‚Äîwe did it all together. (Kudos to Lakshika, Vanshika, Arqam, Om, Shrish, Gaurish, Rohit, Kundan, Kanishk, Digivijay, Divya)",
      "SDS and its people kept me sane and focused, and I am grateful for such a unique experience.",
      "Ensemble methods in machine learning combine multiple individual models to make better predictions. Here I‚Äôll talk about CS, a place where people come together for the greater good.",
      "My CS journey began with a naive assumption‚ÄîI thought being a Student Guide meant organising fun activities and bonding with juniors. When I became an SG, I understood the responsibility of being someone‚Äôs guide/mentor in this college life. But it never felt like a weight because I understood that CS wasn‚Äôt about having all the answers‚Äîit was about creating space for people to find their own.",
      "Because of a great experience as an SG and because I knew how it felt when someone didn‚Äôt give up on me and was always there for me, I decided to apply to be a CTM. I was not sure if I deserved to be one, but I did it anyway. I think it is the only POR on campus that is associated with character. Once a ctm, you have to behave a certain way and people look at you a certain way. I did become a ctm finally.",
      "Suddenly, I was confronting real mental health scenarios, complex issues, and finally felt the weight of being someone‚Äôs support, because sometimes it might be as intense as being responsible for someone‚Äôs entire future or life. Apart from all these mentally taxing things, being a CTM has a lot of physically exhausting things. During those intense summer months, our team of 20 conducted over 1200 interviews, each lasting 40 minutes to an hour. And of course, Orientation has its own share of sleepless nights. But why do we do all this? This is the beauty of this ensemble method. We spend so many hours interviewing candidates for AM/SG because we want the best for the freshers, people we have never even met. We conduct orientation just to ensure a smooth transition and a comfortable life for the freshers.",
      "We conduct a lot of events to spread awareness. It hurts to see the low turnouts sometimes, but that is the stigma we stand to fight. We do it all so that anyone going through a hard time doesn‚Äôt think twice before asking for help. We are all actively available to help others and be bridges between counsellors and students. And let‚Äôs face the reality, the counsellors aren‚Äôt the best ones, but it does help sometimes. If not with one counsellor, maybe some other can help you out. And I know this because I have seen things work out for people.",
      "We do a lot of things only for the sake of others, but we are not perfect. I wanted to improve upon some things in my ctm tenure, and I got way too attached to CS. That‚Äôs why I wanted to continue in CS as a coordinator. My coordinator tenure focused on addressing what I felt was missing during my own CTM experience: making team members feel genuinely impactful and always supported. I never could take personal support from my coordinators, and I tried to change that in my tenure by just trying to be approachable and be there for my CTMs. I genuinely cared for all of them. My CTM tenure also focused a lot on events. In my coordinator tenure, I tried to change that by supporting initiatives and taking charge to see them all executed. My coordi tenure was much better, and everyone got too emotionally attached. Everything was great for me until we had to decide who to pass on the baton. It was one of the toughest decisions of my tenure because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone.",
      "I could say both my tenures had ups and downs, but both of them were extremely successful. I believe I did impact a few lives positively, and as a whole, CS impacted a lot of lives. I will now leave this college, but I know that CS will always continue the great work, and the values of CS will always be a part of me.",
      "The last epoch of my college life was the placement season and the 8th semester. Placements were insanely stressful.",
      "I gave all my placement tests ‚Äòwith‚Äô ALs. In October and November, all you do is give placement tests, there were so many tests and so many companies. We were constantly checking the placement portal and planning our days around the tests. And among all this, I did some chota bhai waale duties for my sister‚Äôs wedding. To be honest, I did coding with all my dedication, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at it. Modest coding, CPI, and belonging to a BS program lead to the same traumatic experience like intern drive. I had zero short lists till 29 Nov. Despair loomed, and I was crazy afraid thinking about the worst things in my life. I would‚Äôve broken down if it wasn‚Äôt for the people around me.",
      "On November 30, I got 4 shortlists ‚Äì 1.1, 1.2 and two 2.2. My first interview was really bad. I said things the wrong way, and couldn‚Äôt solve basic puzzles. 1st December is my mom‚Äôs birthday. I even forgot to wish her. I still remember after my first interview I felt a lot better. All the anxiety went away. I was ready to take a nap and then prepare for my 1.2 interview. I was discussing it with my friend that if he got a walk-in in Microsoft or some other company he‚Äôd probably crack the DSA interview. I said I‚Äôll probably not be able to crack it. Within 5 minutes I got a call from Manavjeet, ‚ÄúAapka Microsoft mae interview h aap aa jaiye‚Äù. All my friends who were not in interviews ran with me to the venue. The first round was online. I didn‚Äôt have earbuds and I randomly found Amay there. He gave me his earbuds for the round 1 interview. 1st interview was really good, the interviewer‚Äôs name was also Pankaj. I knew I had cleared round 1 when I got out. Round 2 was slightly difficult, I had to write the code on a piece of paper. I wrote the code correctly then I was grilled on my intern work to the point where I thought my intern research was pointless. I thought the interview was not very good, but I still had my hopes up. After a few minutes of waiting outside the venue with ALs, the HR came out and showed a thumbs up to me. I cried then and there. From no shortlist to 4 shortlists to clearing a walk-in interview, I was finally placed. I quickly shifted my focus to ALs and their placement, ran for them, and supported them. 1.1 was over. Meanwhile, I also wanted to share the good news with everyone else. I called my coaching friends early in the morning and they were so happy. I wanted to tell my family the good news face-to-face. So at 8 am in the morning, I took an auto to my home. Bought some sweets on the way. Now the last thing my family knows is that I am too stressed and I did not clear my first interview. (Context: Both my brother and his wife are Microsoft employees) I go to my home, wake everyone up bring them to the hall, and tell them ki ghar mae ab 2 ni teen MS employees h. Everyone was so happy for me. I came back to campus around 11 am. Rested for a while and then again started running around for my ALs. Running with their resume. Trying to push their interview according to their priority, bringing them food. Within 6 days, everyone was sorted. But I came back home on the 5th day because my sister‚Äôs wedding was very close.",
      "The eighth semester was a whirlwind of CS responsibilities, trip planning to Shimla, Goa, and Haridwar, and joining Prayas‚Äîa long-cherished goal. 8th semester was packed with a lot of parties, clubbing, random night outs, trying every crazy thing with my wingies, making batch videos, writing testimonials, and thinking every moment that this might be the last time doing a thing. CS meets, placement prep and getting placed, trips to Shimla, Goa & Haridwar, DE, Hakuna Matata, living the last days with ALs, h1 ki baraat, and a random villa party, were the peak moments of this final epoch. I never imagined that the 8th semester would be so hectic but it was packed with all the good things.",
      "To judge how good a model was, we have evaluation metrics. So how will you judge my whole college life? Obviously CPI. Okay, who am I kidding? It does matter for some important things of life but it definitely isn‚Äôt a strong metric. Yes, without it I might not have gotten a placement better than I expected. Placement was one of the major goals that I came to IIT for. I value the profound lessons that shaped me into the person I aspired to be. The lifelong bonds I forged with friends stand as another vital metric. The rest will be tested in the next phase of my life.",
      "I‚Äôm unsure if I mastered data science in these four years, but this emotional model of life will guide me forward. It‚Äôs far from perfect, yet I know it‚Äôs the best I could craft. Maybe this is what we are supposed to do ‚Äì continuously train and improve. I‚Äôll continue doing this because, as I said at the start of this article, I always do what I think I am supposed to do.",

From logging into Discord during lockdowns to late-night walks on campus, her poem captures the essence of being part of a COVID batch‚Äîadapting to change, chasing dreams, and discovering strength together. A heartfelt tribute to the years that shaped her and the people who made it home.",

      "to a campus she‚Äôd only wished for.Hailing from Kanpur,IITK was just a few kilometers away,yet it took her two yearsto cross those twenty-two kms.And three years more,to find her footingin twelve hundred acres of wonder.Now‚Äîa lifetime won‚Äôt be enoughto forget even an ounceof what she lived here.",
      "Y21s fizzing with pressure,sealed tight with excitement.Making friends online,checking Discord like clockwork,waiting for that one letterfrom IITK,That would finally call usto our new home.We waited, we learned, we gamed.and somehow,we passed our first semester.Then, the news came‚Äîthe kind that makes you jump a feet higher,‚ÄúWelcome aboard to IITK‚Äù.",
      "with homemade achaara pinch of emotion,a suitcase full of snacks‚Äîwe took off,boarding our three-year-long flight.we soared,finding friends mid-air,connecting across miles,joining clubs & societies,gossiping in hostel corridors,spilling stories like tea at midnight.",
      "Heavy. Dark. Gloomy.They called it ‚ÄúInternship Season‚ÄùAnd it blocked out the sun.Stress hung low,and every other table‚Äîwhispered the same thing:PPOs, CTC, roles, ranks.For me?I dodged the storm,chased the calm‚Äîa fan of research,waited for my magic beanslike James and Jill,on a quiet hill.In February‚Äô24,I opened my fist,saw the golden shimmer‚ÄîA boarding pass,to the land they call dreams,United States,my wish found wings.",

      "In this 25th edition of As We Leave, Aniruddh Pramod, a Y21 BS student from the Department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, writes a heartfelt letter to his past and future self.",
      "Through candid reflections on self-worth, bold choices, lost friendships, and quiet victories, he captures the messy, beautiful process of growing up at IIT Kanpur. From discovering unexpected passions to navigating burnout and learning when to slow down, his journey is deeply personal yet widely relatable for all of us.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "You‚Äôve graduated. 4 years are done. You‚Äôre 21 now. It feels strange, to reach the boundary of adulthood and realise how fuzzy it all feels now that you‚Äôre standing on the line. You‚Äôve done a pretty good job too. You went abroad for the first time. You made a lot of friends, lost a lot of them too. You made mistakes, and did so many things right. You‚Äôve survived, ‚Ä¶ thrived even. There is no such thing as a life with no regrets, but I would be hard-pressed to make better decisions than you did. Of course, there‚Äôs no ‚Äòyou‚Äô here. You haven‚Äôt invented time-travel yet.",
      "But I write this in hope that it will reach some version of you. Some version of you that is just beginning their journey. It will be some version of you that isn‚Äôt me. But I hope that these little notes will help you in your journey in some way.",
      "One. All of this? It‚Äôs going to be about you. These 4 years are going to be about you growing into yourself. You‚Äôll see what makes you beautiful, you‚Äôll see what makes you ugly. And you‚Äôll make peace with it. But none of this will happen unless you allow it to. Unless you push yourself and try out new things and listen to yourself. Nobody‚Äôs going to ask you to. It‚Äôs not required to graduate either. But it will be the difference between living your life with satisfaction and being trapped in what-ifs and FOMO.",
      "And I‚Äôll be honest, I still mess up sometimes. I still have a lot of things that I hate about myself that I really could be more grateful about. But, the journey of self-love is one that has no end, and I can assure you that I have been walking on it. In these 4 years I did learn so much about my identity, and I did embrace so much of it, even if there are still parts that I‚Äôm embarrassed about. And some of it is serious, and some of it is quite silly. Some things I had to learn after repeated lessons, while others I was happy to accept in an instant. Oh and by the way, you‚Äôre going to be so proud of our closet.",
      "Two. There will be times where you are going against the flow. There will be times where other people will be quite strongly against your ideas. Understand that this is okay. The path of the majority will not always be the best path for you. The best path for you might have a lot of opposition, maybe a lot of resistance. Maybe it ends up being extremely lonely. But those signals don‚Äôt immediately mean that it is the wrong path. It will feel all too easy to get absorbed into what everyone else is doing, but resist it. At the very least, don‚Äôt dismiss a path just because you are the only one on it.",
      "Believe me, this one is easy to write down in hindsight, but absolutely terrifying to actually follow. We did not come to college with any idea of what we wanted to do in the future, other than the fact that computers will be a part of it in some way or another. And in the process of figuring it out, sometimes what I wanted just went against conventional knowledge. I refused to do CP because I hated the way it made me feel about programming. I refused to go to the US, and so I applied only to Europe for my master‚Äôs. Things could go wrong, but I‚Äôve found that the regret of not having tried something always stings harder than the regret of trying it and then failing. I suppose in the latter, at least I have the satisfaction of choosing my own demise, but the former leaves you trapped in endless hypotheticals.",
      "Three. You don‚Äôt know what you like. No seriously, you don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt let preconceived notions stop you from trying out things properly. It‚Äôs okay to not have an idea about what you‚Äôll like. It takes years to figure it out. You‚Äôll meet people who completely change their careers when they‚Äôre 30. You‚Äôll meet people who‚Äôve known what they wanted since they were 5. Take your time. Try anything you are interested in, and give it a wholehearted shot. I‚Äôd rather you go all in on everything you try, and figure out a year later that you really don‚Äôt like it than be too scared to walk a path just because you may not like what you find at the end of it. You‚Äôre still a kid. It‚Äôs okay for your preferences to be chaotic. And there will never be a better time to figure it all out.",
      "Rock climbing ended up becoming one of my favourite sports, and I could never have imagined it playing out this way. I was (and still am) such a tennis snob. But this one time in Bangkok, I didn‚Äôt say no to a friend who invited me, and now I hate the fact that there‚Äôs no climbing wall near my home. You‚Äôd be surprised at the variety of experiences you can have if you can tell your social anxiety to chill out for a bit and just say yes. And I still have my asocial phases and my sure-why-not phases, but I am glad I‚Äôve been pushing myself in that department. I‚Äôd say my academics have also been an exercise in finding out new interests, but I would be lying. Somehow 12th grade me would have likely picked out the exact same courses that I have done. Maybe things will be different in Oxford? I‚Äôm still learning what I like. There‚Äôs so many things that I‚Äôm still excited to try soon. But I am perfectly satisfied by the kinds of things IITK gave me a safe space to try out. And I hope you‚Äôll make the most of it too üôÇ",
      "Four. Be conscious of your choices. Sometimes they get overwhelming. Sometimes that makes you delay the decision. But realise that in most cases, if you don‚Äôt make the choice in time, then time will make the choice for you. Sometimes, you don‚Äôt even know that there are choices you are making. When you choose to add more workload on your plate, know that maybe you‚Äôre taking away time that was previously going to selfcare, or maybe towards being a good friend ‚Äì And that might be the right decision, but make sure you‚Äôre aware of the choices you make. I hope you are never stabbed in the back by the consequence of your action. And perhaps more importantly I hope that you never hurt someone as the result of not being conscious of your choices.",
      "It can be surprisingly easy to point out, but hard to recognise when you‚Äôre doing it yourself. The biggest weakness of my tenure as a leader was probably right here. I was so single-mindedly focused on my role as a mentor that I kind of let other things slip away ‚Äì my academics, my hobbies, my growth, and even‚Ä¶ the other parts of being a leader? I didn‚Äôt realise at the time that this was a choice that I made without choosing. Being a club leader sometimes does feel like you just have one big thing coming after another. It can make you feel like there‚Äôs not enough time. I just kept telling myself that I‚Äôll get to the other things right after this next big event ‚Äì but that just never came. So I hope you remember to track the train of time, lest 4 years run through you instead of letting you run through them.",
      "Five. As you become an adult, perfectionism becomes less and less important. It‚Äôs going to become more about making decisions that are 80% right, 80% of the time, as fast as possible. Perfectionism can still have its place, but for the most part, it‚Äôs time to accept some amount of approximation. And do this everywhere else too. Stop waiting until you have a perfect take to post that piano recording. Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself when you put effort into something and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the product reflects it. You know how much of yourself you put into it. The right people will see and appreciate you for it. And what the wrong people say will not matter.",
      "This is definitely a lesson best learnt at Optiver. It is one of the things that being a trader is all about. It boils down to being just a little less self conscious. Other people will never see your work as closely as you do, the world is just far too self-obsessed for that. And those glaring flaws that will keep you up at night may be perfectly invisible to most people who see them. So when you get tired of your inner critic, tell it to shut up, hit submit, and go to sleep. I promise the world will still be spinning the next day. The piano cover that would never be perfect enough for us will still become your best friend‚Äôs favourite ringtone. The art that might look tacky in your hands just might actually look great at a distance. And if I‚Äôm being honest, there is an acute shortage of people who are proud of the effort they put into something. And while it is not the flashiest tribe to be a part of, it‚Äôs definitely one worth being proud about.",
      "Six. Take those risks. Make bold moves. You‚Äôre still in college, you‚Äôve got a whole life ahead of you, so why act as if everything has already been decided? So what if you don‚Äôt make it. So what if things go wrong. You can patch it up, you can figure it out. You still have time to fall back completely on the ground and try one more time. Don‚Äôt let the fear of failure stop you from finding out all the things you might be great at. It‚Äôs not about winning every single bet you make. It is about winning most of them. Don‚Äôt take this to mean that you should go big every single time. Try to stay a little outside the safety zone most of the time, and keep watch for when there is a chance to go big.",
      "Honestly though? I don‚Äôt think anyone who knows me would describe me as a risk-taker. They‚Äôll probably tell you that I calculate to the last detail. That I have plans A through Z, and probably even all the way through the greek letters. So I must say I feel a little preachy saying all this(to be fair I feel preachy about this entire ordeal). But whenever I did let things go a little spontaneous, campus always had a soft landing spot for me. Whether it was in terms of people to cry on, or just the cozy corner in CCD I could always come back to ground myself in. When I felt lost in terms of my career, there were people I could ask to help me find the rails again. When I felt lost in terms of academics is when I met the most esoteric but delightful professors I could have met. And if I felt lost in terms of everything, just walking around campus at night made me feel whole again. So if I were to get a do-over, this is what I would be trying to do.",
      "Seven. In your pursuit of greatness, remember to do good. IIT is a place of dreams. It‚Äôs a place that sees your ambition and dares you to double it. But it is a place I remember through bits of conversations. I implore you to dream big, and keep dreaming bigger. But I beg that you don‚Äôt forget to encourage others to dream too. And sure, maybe most people will only end up remembering you if you get an amazing placement package, or if you win laurels at the InterIITs. But you‚Äôll also be remembered by the friend you were there for when they really needed you. You‚Äôll be remembered for helping that junior out when they were panicking about their life or depressed with their intern season. So make time for the little things, to help people out, and to listen to them, even as you tread on towards becomingchaapu.",
      "Who knew that such a beautiful piece of advice would come from an animated show created by a video game developer? Actually, I did? Video games always manage to surprise me with extremely deep messages and stellar advice? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a good person to make this point. But whatever. There is no personal memory to connect this to, since this is advice I encountered much towards the end of my journey, but I can explain what it makes me think of. It makes me think of random acts of kindness. It makes me think about the times where a senior pushed me to do something he knew I‚Äôd enjoy, and the times where I sat with a friend for hours just listening to everything that was wrong with their life. A lot of people have been very kind to me when I expected it the least, and I hope I was that person to a lot of people too. This bit of advice is why I am so glad to have had the privilege of leading a club. I may not have grown much in terms of technical skills, but I really did like being able to mentor and give back to the community, even if I couldn‚Äôt do it on a large scale. And I know that there were at least a few juniors whose lives I did impact in a positive way. Some within the club, some through the club, and some in ways I still laugh about. If nothing else, I know that there are 4 kids who succeeded me as coordinators (nope, not leaders), and their achievements will always make me proud. And this feeling will always be one that I cherish.",
      "Eight. You‚Äôll make a lot of friends, and you‚Äôll lose a lot of friends. As you figure out the person you‚Äôre growing into, you might recognise that your existing friends don‚Äôt actually make you a better person, or don‚Äôt fit into your lifestyle anymore, or maybe they just don‚Äôt actually have much in common with you now. And that can be scary, but it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs part of growth. It can feel like you are doing something wrong. It can feel like they‚Äôre doing something wrong. And yet sometimes, the best thing to do in such a situation is to let them go. To love someone (or even something) is to accept that there may come a heartbreaking goodbye ‚Äì so when it is time to bid adieu, don‚Äôt run away from it.",
      "This is the lesson that I seem to absolutely refuse to learn. Funny thing is that life will keep teaching you the lessons that you don‚Äôt learn. I think that when we feel comfortable with someone we just start putting so much of ourselves into them, and then we struggle to accept that the growth that comes from all of this, doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be convergent at all. And that‚Äôs actually beautiful in its own way. The love we send out doesn‚Äôt just get trapped in a short back and forth, it spreads out and grows and reaches so many more people and so many more places. And it‚Äôll find its way back to you, in a different form. So love fiercely. Make sure everyone you care about knows how much they mean to you. And if time comes to part ways, then do it with a smile. The little time you got to spend together was really the point all along.",
      "Nine. Know when you need to slow down. And I‚Äôm only telling you this because I know you tend to overwork yourself. I know that when you really want something you‚Äôll stop at nothing to get it. I know you‚Äôll use your passion as an excuse to burn yourself out completely. But sometimes, you need to stop and look around at the life you‚Äôre building for yourself just so you can keep going ahead. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out when you can take it light, no grand signals from the cosmos will tell you that it is a good time. In fact, it never is a ‚Äògood‚Äô time, maybe you do miss out on opportunities because you took a break, and sometimes you need to take one anyway. Because unless you take them, you will not be able to catch the big ones anyways. An endless hustle can give you a lot of things, but it is also a guaranteed train to burnout. So learn to manage the hustle, and step away from things that take away your ability to manage it.",
      "One of my fondest memories was my first cab ride in Bangkok, from the airport to my hostel. Nothing about it was extraordinary, but it was my first time abroad, and looking out of that cab was when it really hit me. How the roads looked the same as home, but the cars didn‚Äôt. In those wee hours of early morning, a year of hard work suddenly felt so incredibly worth it. And that‚Äôs all I ask you to do. Just look around you sometimes. Look at the people you have, look at the places you are in, and let yourself feel the joy of having reached that point in your life. Let gratitude seep into you from time to time. And when life is tough and it feels like there is nothing to be grateful about, I hope this campus will still give you things you can feel happy to be a part of.",
      "And Finally. Ten. You‚Äôll make it. You‚Äôve been through worse, and maybe there are horrors beyond my imagination up in the road ahead. But we‚Äôll get through. That‚Äôs our thing. We always do. Did we not make it here after all? If you believe in it enough, the universe will conspire to give it to you. So keep faith in yourself, trust your gut, and you‚Äôll be just fine. You‚Äôll meet some amazing people and see some amazing sights, and perhaps most importantly ‚Äì grow up to be someone you can be proud of, in more ways than one.",
      "I have your back, me. I know you won‚Äôt exactly be able to reach out to me when you need it, and I know that the road ahead will make it so hard to keep believing in how much you‚Äôre capable of. But I promise you that you have what it takes. I almost never admit it to myself but, you are an absolutely amazing person, and I am so glad to be you. No matter what path you forge for yourself, know that I will never be disappointed.",
      "Here‚Äôs to the end of my journey here, and the beginning of your new one.",

      "In this 24th edition of As We Leave, a Y21 student from the Department of Chemical Engineering reflects on a journey that began in the world of lights and cameras and found its way to the heart of IIT Kanpur. Through moments of change, challenge, and quiet triumphs, we witness a story of transformation‚Äîwhere the campus becomes more than just a backdrop, but a co-author in one‚Äôs personal narrative. This is a tale of growth through unexpected turns, of friendships forged, and of a self discovered amidst the chaos and calm. Between the first step through the gates and the final goodbye, this account reminds us how IITK becomes not just a chapter, but a lifelong imprint.",
      "Prologue: The Opening Scene",
      "If my life had an IMDb page, the first act would be a montage of spotlights, scripts, and the hum of a shooting set. Until Class 10, I was living the actor‚Äôs life‚ÄîTV shows, short films, ads‚Äîmy parents‚Äô world of cinema was my playground. You might call it nepotism, but as Harvey Specter fromSuitswould say, ‚ÄúThe only time success comes before work is in the dictionary.‚Äù Auditions taught me that even if you get a foot in the door, you have to earn your place. I kept my place for over ten years there! When my parents nudged me toward science, I didn‚Äôt know if I was leaving behind a lead role for a cameo, or an even better opportunity in a hit-film. Looking back, it was just a genre switch‚Äîone that set the stage for the wildest series of my life.",
      "Season 1: Origins ‚Äì From Reels to Reality",
      "My IITK story didn‚Äôt start with a Eureka moment; it began with a Class 10 board exam score and a gentle parental nudge toward science. Neither my parents nor I understood the sprawling coaching universe, led by big players like Allen, Narayana, and FIITJEE, so I stuck with my local coaching institute, blissfully prepping for boards through 11th and the first half of 12th, inadvertently. Then, COVID crashed the shooting set‚Äîturning the world upside down but giving me the chance to binge-learn from YouTube‚Äôs best. In those last 5-6 months, I hustled harder than ever, and thanks to a JOSAA counselling twist, I landed in Chemistry at IIT Kanpur.",
      "If you‚Äôd asked the pre-10th version of me, I‚Äôd have declared ‚Äúactor‚Äù as my destiny. I‚Äôd already been on sets, in front of the camera, and even landed some good roles. I learned early, that connections get you to the audition, not the final cut‚Äîjust like cheating might get you to the internship/placement interview, but the offer is yours to earn. But my parents wanted me to focus on studies, and I followed their script, not knowing if it was the right choice. Now, I see it as destiny‚Äôs best plot twist.",
      "",
      "Season 2: Transitions ‚Äì The Chemistry of Change",
      "Landing in Chemistry at IITK was a happy accident‚Äîa preference slip that rerouted my story. I‚Äôd aimed for IITD, but fate (and my own ranking) had other plans. If my entire life isBreaking Bad, then my IITK years wereBetter Call Saul‚Äîunexpected, sometimes awkward, but always building toward something bigger.",
      "Despite my acting days, I was shy off-screen. The first semester, online and distant, kept me in my shell. I barely took part in events, and my dream of a branch change seemed to fade with my first semester SPI. But I promised myself a comeback. When we finally arrived on campus, after a long 4-month hiatus, Hall 13 became my new stage. I did better, but the cutoff for branch change was a tough antagonist. I filled the form, keeping CHE as my lowest preference, expecting nothing after seeing last year‚Äôs cutoffs.",
      "Then, on a train ride back from a (short) summer break, my father, who used to drop me off at campus, handed me the phone‚Äîa friend was calling to say, ‚ÄúCongrats, you got the branch change to CHE!‚Äù The group chat exploded with messages. My father didn‚Äôt realize the magnitude, but for me, it was the best day of my college life so far. From a hesitant start to a surprise breakthrough‚Äîseason two ended on a high.",

      "Trips with my group ‚ÄúDr. Strange‚Äù (yes, named after the movie) brought a new kind of magic. I planned and managed the finances, and even visited IITD‚Äîmy old dream, now just a pit stop. Internship anxiety crept in, but my best friend was my anchor. After months of rejections from interviews, a FAC friend and also an APC, talked with HR to accept my application for an internship at Vedanta, after I‚Äôd missed the deadline unintentionally.",
      "",
      "I had some regrets‚Äîleaving Inter IIT Tech Meet midway, not contributing to hall GCs‚Äîbut Raktarpan brought redemption. Our Republic Day camp in 2024, while I was the Manager, broke donation records, finally beating IITD, which used to get the highest numbers till then. That memory still feels like a finale-worthy win, likeRCBandHarry Kanegetting their first trophies in 2025.",
      "Season 4: Finales & New Beginnings ‚Äì Beyond the Summit",
      "After my internship, I was quietly confident about the PPO‚Äîbut from what I learned after watchingSuits, never assume the deal is done until you see the paperwork. I waited, not prepping for placements, which could have been my undoing, and proved disastrous. The PPO finally arrived in October, and life shifted gears. I even got a semester exchange in Hong Kong for the last semester, but fate had other plans, and I stayed at IITK.",
      "A chance meeting with an M.Tech. at a Product bootcamp led to a spontaneous Rajasthan trip‚Äîthree strangers, a fake wedding card for casual leave, and a week of unscripted adventure. It was the kind of plot twist you only see in movies, but sometimes, real life delivers the best scripts.",
      "",
      "Placements were the ultimate test, also for those not sitting‚Äîmany sleepless days, endless anxiety, and the pure joy of watching friends get placed. When my friend‚Äôs offer was getting delayed, I pulled a classicSuitsmove: a little negotiation with the Coco/Volly, which led to them talking with HR, and within a minute or two, the offer was on the table. Sometimes, you have to channel your inner Harvey and play the game smart, as he says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play the odds, I play the man.‚Äù",
      "Trips became my celebration‚ÄîGoa with Dr. Strange, having a near-miss accident with my bhai, and a trek to Kedarkantha during the midsem break with the ‚ÄúBenzene peeps.‚Äù Even there, IITK connections surfaced unexpectedly ‚Äî two during the trek and a group in Dehradun ‚Äî reminding me that this place isn‚Äôt just a campus, it‚Äôs a constellation of people that lights up your path, no matter how far you wander. I didn‚Äôt reach the summit ‚Äî my body gave out just before it ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt. Obese, untrained, and gasping, I still pushed forward. I wasn‚Äôt chasing a view ‚Äî I was silencing the part of me that always quit. I didn‚Äôt conquer the mountain, but I conquered myself. Like Tyler Durden fromFight Clubsaid, ‚ÄúThis is your life, and it‚Äôs ending one minute at a time‚Äù, and I chose to spend that minute fighting.",
      "My last semester was a montage of night cricket in Hall 9, where I used to be addressed as Thala; random walks, day and night; and friendships that turned into family. From early morning batch-shoots to Zethorers‚Äô wild nights, every moment became a memory.",

      "In this 23rd edition of As We Leave, Mridul Pandey, a Y21 student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, takes us through his vivid, emotionally resonant journey at IIT Kanpur. From an uncertain online beginning and a SITCOM-fuelled JEE-mode first year, to the highs of Inter-IIT, student leadership, and eventually cracking a dream Quant placement, his story captures the beautiful chaos of campus life. Whether it‚Äôs mapping out all accessible areas of campus in his early days, exploring rooftops, wrestling with FOMO-driven overcommitments, or stepping far outside his comfort zone ‚Äî each chapter reflects a fierce pursuit of exploration, self-awareness, and growth. This AWL is a tribute to a journey marked by transformation, serendipity, relentless ambition, and the indelible spirit that makes IITK feel like home.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Writing an AWL is quite a bittersweet process. Having left the campus only so recently and having said goodbye to everything that mattered over the last four years, it is only fair to feel emotional chaos in your mind. Sitting on your chair, reminiscing about your memories through all those 4 golden years, you start to wonder if life will ever be the same again? You can‚Äôt help but miss the serene beauty of the campus, the different spots on campus which have become important landmarks of memories with your friends, you miss the ease with which you could just contact and meet your friends. It all feels surreal yet over. It‚Äôs this constant denial, this reluctance to acknowledge the end, that had me procrastinating on this AWL until the very last minute. Though those who know me will say it is only symbolic of my campus journey that I write my AWL right before the deadline.",
      "Looking back at these 4 years, I can‚Äôt help but resonate with Steve Jobs‚Äô famous quote:",
      "‚ÄúIt can be hard to trust in the process when you can‚Äôt see the bigger picture. But you never know what might be around the corner, so you have to keep moving forward.‚Äù",
      "I still recall the naive, innocent version of myself, unsure of my decisions, constantly doubting every move and swept away in the currents of FOMO. Yet, everything I did, all the mistakes I made, the decisions I took(or in all fairness, did not take), make sense now. I‚Äôll forever be grateful to this place as it helped me find myself, understand how I work, my interests, my dislikes and everything that made me who I am today.",
      "My time at college can be seen as an instance of taking seniors‚Äô advice about ‚ÄúExploring and then committing‚Äù(Yes, I am also an RL enthusiast) way too seriously. I remember thinking before coming here that the campus has 1200 people(Y21 only) and 1100 acres of land, I must get to know all of them as well as map out the entire campus. In fact, in the initial years of my campus life, I did just that.",
      "Owing to COVID, a good part of our first year took place online. I don‚Äôt particularly have any core memories from this time. Being more of an old school guy in the sense that I like to make friends in person, so the night-long bulla meets didn‚Äôt interest me enough. Instead, I found solace in watching numerous SITCOMS(have watched almost all at least 3 times) and doing acads in JEE mode(like an average branch changer enthusiast). While the branch changing dreams ended in the first sem itself, it took offline proceedings to understand how one studies in college.",
      "It is only after coming to the college in an offline fashion is when I would say my college journey really started. I bonded with my wing and found a surrogate family in them. We were together 24/7, having late-night discussions, musical nights, to celebrating birthdays in the crazy IITK fashion (PS: mine was the first birthday of the wing, and of course it was particularly unhinged).",
      "The 2nd sem has got to be the chillest sem out there, with online acads and offline friendships, a true symbol of the slow yet peaceful life.",
      "Slowly, I started going outside and started the exploration I was so excited to begin. I started",
      "meeting new people, socialising and finding myself a core group of friends and the supposed ‚Äúmy people‚Äù. We had the time of our lives together, we explored every rooftop, every alley in the campus, often also being chased away by SIS guards for going towards restricted areas. We became remarkably close, having shared a lot of our firsts together, be it having our first trip to Udaipur together or our first nightouts; we started spending most of our days together.",
      "It all seemed to be a perfect cinema-worthy college life, but the cliche of ‚ÄúGood things must end‚Äù is unfortunately true. The semester before the intern season arrived, and although I had maintained a decent CPI uptill that point, I felt the need to do more. What followed was a series of questionable choices, often being fuelled by FOMO from my peers. I ended up finding myself having 5 PORs, doing INTER-IIT, having a few prof projects, while at the same time having to manage the toughest BATTI sem (I still get ESO203 nightmares), where 4-5 quizzes per week was a norm rather than an outlier. My social life took a massive hit. I found myself working on the PS till 6 AM, then studying for the quiz scheduled at 9 AM, and I knew something had to give. Through some major help from my friends and seniors, I was able to compartmentalise. I gave up most of the PORs and projects that I had and started to focus on what was important. I",
      "had the time of my life doing INTER-IIT, learning a lot about myself and my interests. It is during this phase that I decided to go for ICG leader as well. I somewhat managed to maintain my acads to some extent as well, but I must say, I have been incredibly lucky in terms of grades throughout my 4 years at IITK, narrowly sneaking out on grade boundaries on multiple occasions.",
      "Then came the summers before the intern season. I was deeply worried about my prep. What followed was a remarkable tryst with destiny. Without much deep thought, I had registered for a BCG case ideathon competition along with my friends (The first prize was a MacBook, so the main motivation was to complete my Apple ecosystem lol). From a lot of eventful episodes of almost missing our flight to finals, to being sleep deprived without any proper run through of our pitch, we ended up winning the competition. And there I stood with an intern offer to BCG, before the intern season itself. I still felt a certain emptiness in accepting the internship offer, since I had dedicated all my life uptill that point towards tech, with my resume reflecting the same. Yet in the name of exploration (and perhaps drowning under a wave of indecisiveness), I accepted the offer.",
      "The third year was a mellow period of my life, where I reconnected with my friends, partied hard together, and kept working on my tech stack (just in case). This was also the time I became the ICG leader and had a memorable experience, connecting with secies, holding sessions and meets, interacting with various organisations, attending conferences, it was important for me to attain clarity about what I really wanted to do in my career.",
      "Then started my internship at BCG. I obviously had my doubts beforehand as well about whether I would like the work or not. I ended up having a not-so-pleasant experience (which, to some extent, can be credited to my overly negative priors). I had even thought of dropping off midway from the internship, but some helpful advice from my seniors (special mention to Akshat Goyal and Shreyansh Agarwal), I ended up completing my internship, while also trying to enjoy my time there to some extent.",
      "It was on the third day of the internship itself when I decided that I was going to sit for placements and had made a roadmap for the same. Being significantly behind everyone due to my lack of tech-based intern prep, I had a lot to do. I don‚Äôt have many memories when I look back at the 7th sem, apart from many hours solving questions on Leetcode. I became somewhat underground for the 7th sem, focusing all my energy towards placement (I also missed half of Badshah‚Äôs concert due to this, which I still regret). But, in the end, things worked out, and after 5 long hours of a rigorous interviewing process, I got placed in my dream Quant firm.",
      "What followed was a state of absolute peace after 1 year of chaos in my mind. I finally knew I was going to do something that I really liked and looked forward to doing. This was followed by the cliche Goa trip in December, which was just perfect in every sense. It was all about unhinged fun, far too adventurous watersports, strolling across the beaches of Goa, exploring the clubs and casinos, it was all too fun.",
      "The last sem also had a touch of serenity to it. I finally had a sem when I just had to do acads. I had learned how to study and manage acads, thus they too no longer felt like a burden. I decided to focus on myself, have fun with my friends, play *almost*regular badminton, gossip a little too much in CCD, partying harder than ever, while at the same time trying to relinquish all the memories this place had given me. I participated in the dance extravaganza and performed in front of the entire crowd, something that my past self wouldn‚Äôt even have imagined doing. I also went on an international trip to Vietnam with my friends during this sem. I even managed to find new friends and memories in the last sem, which I know will last for life.",
      "The 8th semester was the near-perfect ending to my journey at IITK. These 4 years have been the most cherishable and character-defining part of life. Like every JEE aspirant, I had heard during the prep years that ‚ÄúIIT jaake toh life sort hai‚Äù, I always used to think that it was from the perspective of getting a decent job, but though that is to some extent true, the greatest gift that IITK gave me was myself. My whole personality development, ability to handle pressure (anyone will become chilled out about academics when you have to give 5 quizzes every week in batti, cause you get no time to stress), living the life on the famous phrase¬† ‚ÄúChill Hai‚Äù has developed here. A lot has happened in these 4 years, from rejection and failures to celebrations over the rooftop, numerous heartbreaks to finding love, feeling socially awkward or introverted at the beginning, to having a chain of friends you can always trust. It has made me ready to face what lies ahead. By learning engineering at IITK, I might not always remember all the concepts of Electrical (to be fair, I don‚Äôt think I remember any lol), but it has given me the confidence and ability to face any challenge that lies ahead and the everlasting self-belief within me.",
      "To any junior or aspirant reading it, I would give you the same advice that I was given by my seniors: Explore, find your calling; do what feels right to you; socialize and find your people, don‚Äôt be afraid to do something different; and it will all make sense at the end.",

      "In this 22nd edition ofAs We Leave, Kunaal Gautam, a Y21 student from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, reflects on his time at IIT Kanpur ‚Äî not through grand milestones, but in the quiet, everyday moments that came to mean everything. We witness how the campus, with its stolen naps, lingering walks, and fleeting conversations, grew from a place of uncertainty to one of belonging.Through it all, what remains is a deep affection ‚Äî for the people, the spaces, and the ordinary days that quietly became unforgettable.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Life often feels like a linear journey.",
      "Cause and effect.",
      "Days appearing as repeatable units that occur again and again. The days bleeding into weeks and months and poof, it‚Äôs over? Perhaps that‚Äôs what happens when we try to see all of it together at once. We feel too small, too insignificant, and maybe a little powerless? The vastness of our lives in front of us often causes us worry and headaches ‚Äì‚ÄòKya karunga mai?‚Äô‚Äì rather than a sense of curiosity and adventure for the tales unknown. Those words are often more apt for novels and stories.",
      "But aren‚Äôt these stories the reimaginings of the world around us? The people around us? And how these interact with each other and create the very lore we might be reading on a page. I like reading books a lot, escaping into those worlds which are but a figment of the imagination of some authors, but the key difference being that, those stories might encompass a whole life in a matter of a few pages. I don‚Äôt get the option of jumping to checkpoints, to experience life as I‚Äôm watching a netflix show, pushing the right arrow key everytime I come to a boring segway.I have a tendency to yap and jump to tangents, but the central point still emerges: we are shit at modelling the future. We take a fraction of variables and relations in the graph and make (un)reasonable predictions, often committing heavy overfitting based on our past experiences. So, then what is the point in searching for the bigger picture, the bigger meaning (most of the times we can‚Äôt even commit to a dinner 3 weekends down because the boss might claim that time :P)",
      "The meaning has to emerge from the process, the very act of experiencing each day and living onto the next. Over the years, the days might blend into each other, but each day in IITK has been somewhat different for me, changing me and people around me, always telling me more, always making me feel curious about the next day. Capturing everything that happened in this place is impossible, there are so many times that I myself realise something amiss that I might not even have thought about in my 4 years here. But I would like to attempt to describe a more-than-a-typical day here, a day that I might have lived a thousand times but I would give anything to live one more time.",
      "üé∂Ode to the Mets ‚Äì The Strokesüé∂",
      "(..Not gonna wake up here..)The alarm rings, for the 7th time in an afternoon as I snooze it again ‚Äì Just 5 more minutes, the cooler is on, the birds are chirping and the pillow is soft. I often wonder that why we never get to sleep enough ‚Äì it feels so absurd that we think of sleep as this negotiable thing, that is equivalent to drinking water ‚Äì ‚Äúbaad me piliyo bhai, chill hai‚Äù‚Äì rather than something akin to breathing (‚Äúbhai aur wait karunga saas lene me toh tu hi leliyo fir‚Äù). After joining work here in Mumbai, sleeping as an activity is for the weekend, but god do I miss those afternoon siestas.",
      "But enough is enough, it‚Äôs 4 and I have to reach Dissentby 5:10, since the instructor does not like when anyone is late to the class. It‚Äôs very valid if you enter late in a class of 7 sitting in a round table, both your absence, and the concurrent late presence, is noticeable. I walk out to the wing, and see a small horde of people passing around lollipops and laughing a lot. This is what you love about college, and it is this image which old people are nostalgic about when they talk about ‚Äúthose times‚Äù. You live in a mini-city in IITK, in hall-1 with these people you know and adore, and anytime that you‚Äôre going anywhere, you find these mini-rest stops of people, just standing together, talking about anything under the sun (one time, a friend of mine was describing how he tried to make smoke bombs, and successfully, used them to feel like a ninja), and having the time of their lives. One of my friends is a metaphorical manifestation of a rest stop ‚Äì he operates a walking shuttle toSurajtea stall10 times a day (even if you‚Äôre reading this years after its release, there‚Äôs a chance you might find him walking with a purpose as the sun sets).",
      "But what is it that prevents us from recreating this? If our life is in our control, why not search for this ‚Äî I think the word we‚Äôre looking for is ‚ÄòCommunity‚Äô‚Äî and attempt to create that in your life. It is this feeling of community that makes IITK so special and got me through the highs and lows of that phase of my life. It is this community which is invaluable beyond words and something that the market might never be able to value, no amount of money can simply buy it out of thin air. It‚Äôs an active act of creation, of finding people and creating spaces wherein you canbe yourself and be loved for it. I chose IITK over anything else, because I thought I might find cool people here but I found something much more: the most crazy sets of people who made me feel like myself, much more than any individual introspection ever could. And if I could advice anything from my position as a graduate to the people who still call this home (newsflash: no one knows anything so take it with a pinch of salt) find people who you can spend hours with, people with whom you can hang out without planning or a reason to meet, people with whom you don‚Äôt have to thinkki hum baat kya karenge. You might not find exactly what you envision, and that‚Äôs a good thing because, like I said,no one knows anythinglol.",
      "(..Waitin‚Äô for me down on the street..)So, after a 20-minute detour of silly yaps, I exit the block, walking towards the back gate, humming to the background music ringing in my ears. I walk past the cycle stand, my cycle having been stolen and re-stolen and so on in a cycle, and see Peanut and Bojack fighting over a piece of bread. A friend of mine named them this due to the color of their fur, and since they hung around in our block (both the puppies and the friend), the name stuck. I like dogs a lot, because it always feels as if they know where they are going, the exact opposite of what I feel most of the time :P. Anytime you look at a dog, they are exploring the same road which they have been on since the first year, always sniffing around as if after years of digging, they‚Äôll now strike gold. There are so many dog gangs in IITK, with them constantly barking and growling at each other till the clock strikes the hour, whence they unite and start barking at us, exiting our classes/halls.",
      "The tribalism in dogs resembles those we see among students in our campus. It‚Äôs both arbitrary and aggressive, and often unites against the common enemy: be it exams or placements or professors. We always feel a tendency to join a tribe, a group of friends that we can roam around with and be identified with, lest we are left alone, without any tribe, unrecognisable, invisible. God, the pressure is huge for a kid just entering college, after years of only talking to their coaching material, to find peers that they can spend every waking moment with. I remember the anxiety I felt when the first semester started online and I felt I would be left behind. By the time that I actually met different people, they would already be best buds, having so many zoom calls and online study sessions to share, and I would feel like an outsider.",
      "Kids,It‚Äôs overrated. Think about how fundamentally a group existing sustainably seems so improbable. The more the people, the more the inter-relations, the more the chaos. It‚Äôs not tight knit groups we chase, but people and friends. I might sound a bit naive, but IITK gives you so many chances to meet interesting people that might just be solitary endpoints in a social graph, that you would never be alone here. I was never part of a sustainable group (it imploded in half a year), but I have a loose amalgamation of people and small groups that I love and adore. The one advantage of such individual relations is that it is always a choice that you spend time with them. And doesn‚Äôt that affirm the fact that this is what friendship is? A choice to spend time together and have fun, to be able to depend on each other when the world around is in chaos.",
      "Dear reader, I understand that these words ring hollow when you feel all alone on the weekend in your hostel room, but keep trying ‚Äì because what this place gives you via wings, clubs, teams and courses is a chance to meet people that might just stick around in later chapters of your lives.",
      "(..Back from his trip, he‚Äôs at the door..)I hurry up and reach academic area gate 3, waving to hordes of people passing me by. I get stopped by a couple of juniors, all excited about a club event, ‚ÄúAap aana bohot maza aayega‚Äù and then excitedly yapping about their plans for the said event. Think about clubs and societies under the gymkhana as a concept. A group of people congregating all because they like a specific activity and then doing it together. In a college life where everyday is a constant juggle between attendance, assignments, exams (don‚Äôt forget the thousand man hours for ‚Äúupskilling‚Äù), it seems almost silly to meet in the litsoc room for hours debating on the most weird motions and yet it is one of the happiest memories of my college life. Perhaps because when you remove the life-deciding competitive stakes of cpi/intern/placement, being with people and doing activities for the sake of doing them feels content.",
      "",
      "Peeps, listen to me, alright, not everything has to have a grand meaning within the cosmos of life propelling you into a cushy future, some things can just be. I never debated because I thought it might help me with public speaking (who wants to speak to them anyway) or any XYZ reason, I did it because I loved abstracting and talking about how I would deal with situations or issues while being consistent with some ideas I have of the world. Now you may have different reasons for doing stuff but if it aligns with the way you feel and express yourself, it can be a liberating experience. And there‚Äôs something different about meeting people who come from different walks of life, from different places, from different years, all uniting to do nothing productive (according to the market).",
      "4:42!(..Innocent time, out on his own..)I panic thinking, how I could have spent nearly 40 minutes and still not reach the one class I want to attend in a day. But then I stopped. What am I panicking about? What‚Äôs the hurry? You know as well as I do that the faculty building ain‚Äôt far away. Then why feel the anxiety, that I have somewhere to be, something to do, not even a second to waste, because there‚Äôs so much. But is there?Have you ever looked at the trees in the academic area when the afternoon sun is just dipping in the winters? The sun rays shine like gold through the leaves, charging everything it lands on with a color that a camera is never able to capture. I love the IITK campus ‚Äî there‚Äôs so many splashes of colors everywhere, from the faded red bricks of the library, to the leafy green trees to the algae-filled-not-cleaned-frequently-enough fountain (yeah, not everything is picturesque).",
      "You never really can see trees rising above you when you‚Äôre outside ‚Äì there‚Äôs always a building or a statue or a hoarding in the way. The most you can see in a city is maybe some trees sticking out but then you go there and realise its a park (with entry and exit timings duh). A thing that I tried doing in my 4th year was to stop myself in the most hectic of times and just try to notice different elements in my environment ‚Äì to just remind myself of what is natural and what is constructed, that maybe the contentment I feel here is an indicator that only grinding myself to dust can‚Äôt be the only way to find happiness. That these things matter. That life cannot just be a never-ending race, even though the world is fast and you might be left behind.",
      "",
      "Left behind by whom? The academic area is a beautiful place, at least the old parts, with people sitting on the ground in front of L20 in the winters, trying to capture some warmth in the cold. The meadow besides the walkway looks magical when the flowers are blooming. (Forgive my waxing words for flowers, I just see corporate grey and ‚Äòoff-white‚Äô most of the day). Just take a seat. It‚Äôs going to be fine.",
      "(..It‚Äôs the last one now, I can promise you that..)After spending some more valuable minutes walking around, instead of taking left, I walk straight through the side doors of CCD, almost reflexively. I don‚Äôt like coffee but CCD feels like one of the central nerves of the campus, a place where you can see people from far away lands (such as Hall 9) as well as territories much closer (My best friend next door has a crazy coffee addiction).",
      "I walk around, just waving to people and stealing a bite of thecroissantfrom here and there. I see a liberalSalmanbhai going to the pool, to swim his troubles away. I see Vox people in a corner discussing a new article. I wave to my love, and she grins at me for a second before resuming her excited chatter, impassionately continuing on, daring anyone to interrupt her. I see a yapper with a cold coffee and a chilli cheese toast in her hand, hunched over her laptop , hiding it like it has all the answers in the world (She was a TA, so maybe for a very small subset of the world). I walk to the counter, seeing the coffee addict grab the cup of cappuccino and walk to the wall.",
      "The wall. No place like it exists in the world. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs a place which unites people. Students. I take an empty seat as the coffee monster besides me takes a huge gulp of coffee, nearly burning his tongue.",
      "I almost do not recognize myself before IITK. Or maybe even most years in between. College has been a cultural revolution, the likes of which I never could have imagined. I have found friends here, suffered heartbreak, been humbled multiple times, found the meaning of life, only for it to dissolve, in an ever flowing state of change. I have found the love of my life here. I have found family here. I have felt complete.",

      "In this 21th edition ofAs We Leave,Shreyash Nallawar, a Y21 student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, takes us through a heartfelt and honest reflection of his IIT Kanpur journey. From the uncertainty of an online beginning during COVID to the excitement of finally stepping on campus, his years were marked by self-discovery, academic challenges, and countless memories. It was through the Photography Club that Shreyash found both purpose and community ‚Äî eventually leading the team to a gold medal at Inter IIT. Along the way came setbacks, late-night wanderings, valuable friendships, and a final-year placement at BPCL. His story is a tribute to perseverance, passion, and the people who make IITK feel like home.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "15thOctober 2021 ‚Äì the date of doomsday. The day that I decided I would be somewhere in some IIT doing a Btech degree for some of my years. Of course, I am writing this, you are reading this, which implies I spent my time here at the super wonderful campus of IIT Kanpur, pursuing Mechanical Engineering. I am weaker at remembering dates, but if I am not wrong, I joined IIT Kanpur on 1stDecember 2021 online and for the first time offline on 6thApril 2022 due to the aftereffects of nasty COVID-19. I was super excited to visit an IIT and that too as a student. The campus presented me with new people, new culture, new atmosphere, new routine, and a chance to build upon myself. I remember when I arrived at the campus, my SG (Student Guide), Arkachur Bhattacharya, contacted me and offered all the help that he could with the initial process so that I could have a smooth transition. Then I got introduced to all my wing mates with whom I had only interacted in online mode, and my first roommates, Yash and",
      "Swastik. Both were unique personalities, and having to live with them taught me many things, from improving my adjusting nature to how to study and how not to.",
      "This is one of the first photos with my first interactions with my wingies and my first friends here at IIT Kanpur. I have always been grateful to have them in my life and have shaped me to become who I am right now.",
      "I began my wandering throughout the campus the very next day. Roaming into the lush green, beautiful campus with friends with no stress and tension was one of the very pleasant times that I experienced. I can still remember how excited I was to go to the library for the first time and do everything except study. I guess that was more important thenüòÇ.",
      "The above picture is of us going to the library in the scorching heat for the first time, especially to relax in the ACüòÇ.",
      "This is me posing in front of the famous Crow in the Acad area.",
      "As we were called on the campus, I was exposed for the first time to the concept of Fests! What amazing days they are. You groove, you roam, you dance, you enjoy forgetting everything else. I think I have gathered a huge store of memories from all the fests here at IIT Kanpur. These are the few things which will be missed once you leave this place, so go there, enjoy yourself, give yourself some time, and relax.",
      "As we were learning to cope and handle, the academics came the very first outings with my friends, which have only made our bond stronger.",
      "The above pictures capture those beautiful times of my first year.",
      "Talking about the academics of the first year because I have to, as they had a huge impact on me and probably most of us.",
      "Everyone here at IIT Kanpur has to go through a set of IC (Institute Compulsory) courses, which I was least interested in and found very challenging. I should have studied them with proper care and sincerity, but I guess I lacked it a bit, and it obviously affected my grades. To the few juniors who may read it sometime, a small piece of advice is never neglect academics! No matter how boring some courses may get but good grades will always help you everywhere!",
      "Good grades and a good CPI open up a number of doors. It‚Äôs not that only good CPI will make you achieve things, but a good CPI will provide you with opportunities a little easier.",
      "The most important skill to learn at IIT Kanpur is probably balancing academics with the wide range of activities that you may be interested in exploring. I think any suggestion will always be a personal bias, no matter how hard we try to deny but still I will suggest everyone to find a hobby, find an activity that you will enjoy, find something that will provide you with inner peace( I do sound like an enlightened one here lol) make yourself unique from others work on yourself. I think I learnt it a little late, but ig its okay! Better late than never. The typical philosophy that people (I too used to) usually follow, and I think is flawed, is ‚ÄúAbhi ye achieve karleta hu ya complete karleta hu firuske baadenjoy karunga, khudpe time dunga ya man ki karunga.‚Äù This ‚Äúuske baad‚Äù never comes!! For me, first it was clearing JEE, then it became getting good grades, then getting an internship, then a good placement, and this will go on, I am sure of that.",
      "It is easier said than done, but I would suggest all to enjoy your time doing things that you love to do along with the academics or studies, instead of hoping to enjoy when all this will finish. We should learn from others‚Äô mistakes, and this is the lesson that one should learn from my mistakes. Time is the greatest resource one can have at IIT Kanpur; invest it most judiciously.",
      "The feeling of coming to the second year at the end of riding a roller coaster of the first year, and finally no longer being a fresher, was unique. I got involved in various activities and clubs, including the Photography Club, the Aeromodelling Club, and the Skating Club. Getting involved in all these activities posed the challenge of time management, which I learnt to tackle in due course of time. The second year made me realize that not everything goes as planned. You dedicate your time to learn a skill and creating an interest, but you fail. But it‚Äôs completely fine if it doesn‚Äôt turn out the way you expected. Every experience is a learning in its own right.",
      "During my second year, I got closely involved withthe Photography Club.Thanks to the amazing events conducted by my seniors of the club, Granth, Nitin, Shubhda, and Saksham, which created a wild curiosity and interest in me towards photography. Then I applied to be a secretary of the club so that I could learn more, but sadly was not selected :(. But my curiosity led me to request the seniors of the club to let me also be a part of the club. After multiple requests, I was indeed a part of the club! That‚Äôs the specialty of the culture of this institute, right? You just have to show your enthusiasm (enthu is our lingo) and passion to be a part of a peer group, that‚Äôs it. The day I was welcomed as a part of the photography club, I made sure that I would not let this opportunity go to vain. As time passed, my interest in photography grew exponentially thanks to the strong support and learning provided by Granth and all the other club members. These were the moments when I realised I finally got something which I truly enjoy, something that gives me happiness, and that was photography. A major part of my personality has definitely been shaped during my time with this club. Apart from photography, I learnt to work as a team, conduct events and sessions, create similar interests in others, and much more. During December 2022, I got to be a part of the Inter IIT contingent for the Inter IIT Cult Meet 5.0 to be held in IIT Madras in the first week of January 2023, for the event of street photography. It was a very proud moment for me, as it should be. I finally got to showcase the skills that I have gathered till now with the club.",
      "I was a part of the photography contingent of IIT Kanpur on the way to IIT Madras in the chilling cold of Kanpur.",
      "As I already said, things often do not turn out as u have expected! As soon as we reached IIT Madras, I fell ill ü•≤. I turned helpless due to my high fever and cold. After complete bed rest for a day and a half, I gathered the courage to come up on the street with a camera in hand and a great company of friends. I had mixed emotions of happiness and sadness simultaneously. But I was happy that I did contribute to the team despite the conditions. All thanks to the extreme support of friends like Anshu and seniors like Granth.",
      "At the end of my tenure as secretary, I decided to further lead the club as I was completely attached to it. I applied for the post of Coordinator of the club for the tenure 2023-2024, and I still remember the night of my interview. It did not turn out well. I was filled with self-doubt and worries, and thoughts like ‚ÄúI have dedicated all my time to photography and still am not worthy of leading the club‚Äù filled my mind. Did I think this was the largest of my problems then? Yes!! But now, after years, I think that I was over-stressing and overthinking. These problems, which appear very large in the short term, are actually very, very small in the long term. I get a smile on my face whenever I think of the kind of thoughts I had when I did badly in my interview and thought I could not do anything. This taught me another lesson that all the problems that we happen to make or think are so big are merely short-term; once you get past them, you will realize how you were too stressed about such small things.",
      "Then the stars aligned, and I guess I did not even do that badly to not become a coordinator! (Sorry for boasting myself :)). I then got the opportunity to lead the club and an even larger responsibility to carry forward its legacy.",
      "While this was all happening, I got my first F grade!! In a course on dynamics. I have never even thought that something like this would happen to me. But I now know that this is all due to negligence and poor practice of the course, along with the course being difficult. Did I panic? Yes !! But now, when I see it as an event 2 years in the past, I think we generally panic over situations, thinking only of the short-term effects. Now I feel there is no need to stress and cry about this, as the event itself does not significantly matter in the long term, but our learnings do. Thus, what matters is the lessons that we have learnt during the situations, whether good or bad.",
      "The end of the second year marked the start of the internship drive. Everyone was fueled up to get an internship to further get a good placement in a typical chain. What was I doing then? Being confused about what to do!!, what role to prepare for, and what will interest me and what will not. I now find that it was then completely normal to not clearly know what I wanted to pursue then as if I or someone knew what he or she actually wanted to do, then half of the problem is already solved, and one just has to dedicatedly and consistently follow a path to reach the specific goal. But how do we find the path that will interest us? I guess the simple answer is to try everything you can. Explore for yourself what works and what does not. This may take up time, but it will make sure you do not end up doing what you don‚Äôt like! Internship season was pretty hard for me. Due to my then relatively poor academic performance and lack of knowledge, I was devoid of even applying for various opportunities that came then. But yeah, a huge huge thanks to my lovely seniors who had my back through this whole time and had a huge positive impact on my mental state and helped me to improve myself. To name a few of the great seniors who had a great impact on me are Aryan Raj, Granth Choudhary, Nitin Kumar, Arkachur Bhattacharya, Divyani Gaur, Vinoba Pandey, Suryanshu Jaiswal, Raj Verma, Vineet Kumar, Sanyam Singla, Vedant Gitte, and Kuldeep Singh. Through their constant guidance and support, I secured an internship at a MedTech startup named Medantrik Medtech as a product design intern. Most of my third year passed trying to get an internship, studying, or doing photography.",
      "During December of 2023, after I completed my 5th semester, came the much-awaited Inter IIT cult meet 6.0 to be held at IIT Kharagpur. As one of the coordinators of the club, I had the opportunity to lead the photography club. A few of the most memorable moments of my college life have been carved in these times. I still remember the phenomenal enthusiasm that we as a team carried on the streets of Kolkata from literally dawn till the last of the light was available on the streets for straight 2 to 3 days. I can never forget how I, along with Atishay and Shubham, were so so tired when we reached in front of the Victoria Memorial and were waiting for second team to reach Kolkata from Kharagpur and book a room so that we can rest, that we fell asleep while sitting on the side of a footpath! Crazy, Crazy time that was, and even crazier teammates. Thank you, PhotoClub, for making my time memorable, always.",
      "The above picture captures all the haste and moments before our final submission for street photography. We literally submitted our entries at 11:59 PM!!",
      "Then the summers at the end of my third year (6th Semester)¬† were quite productive as I started my internship along with a course on probability and learning swimming, lol, managing everything side by side.",
      "The start of the fourth year marked the start of the placement preparation, along with making memories simultaneously, as this was my final year in this beautiful institute. I worked on preparing for multiple roles, ranging from product management to data analytics, machine learning, and core Mechanical Engineering. Again, those were the times of hard grind; managing academics along with the placement prep was tough, especially for me, because I had a lot to improve in my academics, too. I am grateful to all my friends who had my back during these tough times. It is correctly said that a good company can completely change the results! I will just have a simple suggestion to everyone, especially juniors, to be in a good and positive company of friends and people in general, it will surely have a huge impact. Placements are highly unpredictable as far as I have experienced. Along with the skills and academic performance, it also, I believe, depends on luck to a certain extent. But that is out of our hands, and we must keep this in mind and work on improving our skills and be stress-free about the rest. I know it is easier said than done, but the sooner one realises it the easier it will be to cope with these times. In the climax of placements, I was selected as a management trainee in BPCL (Bharat Petroleum)! I still do not know if I wanted this particular job or not, but I am very happy with what I have achieved and am confident that this is just the beginning, and I will strive to achieve great heights.",
      "A picture after my interview for BPCL",
      "After my selection, I was all involved to help my friends during the placement season, may it be to carry their resume and search for walk-ins, provide them emotional and mental support, help them in their interview prep, or just be there for them whenever needed. And yesss, all my friends secured a job, and even though the road was tough, the destination was beautiful, as we will witness it together.",
      "Placement season ended, and now, for the last time for me, the preparation for the Inter IIT cult meet started in full swing. I then the senior-most member of the team had the responsibility to guide and mentor our team for the street photography competition to be held in Patna. This was probably the most memorable Inter IIT for me because of the excellent team that I got, I guess, or because of the excellent bonding between us. And guess what, after three continuous years of efforts, dedication, and improvements, we bagged the Inter IIT GOLD for street photography! I cannot express how happy I was after the results; all the hard work was finally rewarding, and the end was possibly the sweetest. The photography club has shaped me in almost all aspects of my life. I have improved as a person, got a new skill, and a hobby for which I will forever be grateful. Winning the Inter IIT for the club was one of the greatest dreams that I may have had to give back to the club.",
      "The start of 2025 marked the start of my last semester of my B.Tech at IIT Kanpur. All the memories started to flash back in front of me, all the moments that I along with my friends have enjoyed all the bakchodi all the masti and what not. The core memory of the 8th semester is definitely the nightouts and the all-nighters for everything except study. I cannot express how heavy my heart is when I am writing this AWL while remembering all these incidents and memories that I have lived here. Probably, I have met a few of the best people of my life here and enjoyed my life to the fullest. Thank you the the ones who have been close to me through my thick and thin. Thank you to my lovely seniors for guiding me, and thank you to my juniors for making my time here memorable. Hope I added some value to your life, but I definitely got to learn many things from you guys. A special heartfelt thank you to my closest friends Divyanshu Singh, Yash Hatwar, Rutvik Nawade, Arindom Bora, Ritik Ahirwar, Yatendra Singh, Prabhash Mishra, Anwesh Saha, Vaishnavi Singh, Pradeep Bagri, Ajay Makkena, Kundan Kumar, Shreya Verma, Harsh Methwani, Harsh Deshmukh, Swastik Singhal, Mihir Tomar, Aryavart Pradhan, Siddharth Bhalla, Madhav Kumar, Anil Prajapati, Anshu Saini, Shreyas Mirkale, Aakansh Chandra, and the system bhai Tushar Dhanwani thank you for having my back always I will",
      "forever be grateful.",
      "I am not a writer myself, and this is probably the first time I have written this much about myself. I hope I did not bore you :). If you have reached till far, a special thank you to you guys for bearing with the text, hope it has offered something meaningful to you.",
      "All the best, guys, do well in everything and do achieve whatever is meaningful you want and more.",

      "In this 20th Edition of As We Leave, Saugat Kannojia, a graduating Y21 student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, shares some anecdotes on how his college life was shaped by the people around him and the experiences that chiseled them further. It‚Äôs filled with memories that will last forever, a journey of self-improvement and it is as real as it can be.",
      "Disclaimer:-The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Memory is a very abstract concept that can range from being described as an object, like a Skittles box that your favourite person gave to you in the first month of college, to having all-nighters and giving an exam without even sleeping once and getting the worst possible grade in that, so please don‚Äôt. I was the first person among my wingies to have their birthday celebrated on campus after a complete online semester, and it remains as one of my best possible birthdays. Yes, I still remember the pain and suffering of being the first victim of 25 hungry wolves out there to get their frustration out on somebody. Some of those wolves settled down after a while; others became even more ferocious and sharpened their fangs even more. That is just how time, experiences, and dreadful intern and placement seasons can change people and how they view their relationships.",
      "I have felt very attached to music ever since my childhood, when my brother used to listen to all sorts of songs ranging from Green Day to Mohit Chauhan. I never thought that kid would get the chance to perform in front of 400-500 people and then get requested to do it again in his first year of college. Never have I felt anything more fulfilling than that feeling of fear leaving your body and converting into pure joy, it‚Äôs a very rare experience. But the thing is, my music taste was very common for music enthusiasts of the esteemed MClub, or it was too obscure for my other friends who never got the chance to explore music that much. I started to feel disconnected from my own self and started losing my self-confidence after one bad Galaxy performance when the setup went haywire. I started to feel I lost my voice, and my known ones weren‚Äôt present for the performances anymore. Once again, I felt that inner fear that the first year me had lost, start creeping up my vocal cords, so it was time for a showdown again. I still remember Acoustic Night‚Äô25 which got delayed so much that my one and only song, ‚ÄúIris‚Äù by Goo Goo Dolls, got pushed till the end, and we had our production cut midway, but in that moment I felt how much fear I had lost on my self-journey and became true to myself and my own feelings.",
      "This will be a small section but a very important part of my story because a small number of stories get a befitting closure. I started out college with one of the most common cycles, a blue-coloured Vector 91, having no regrets because it is just that amazing. Amazing enough to get stolen by different thieves or a single thief 5 times throughout my time here. However, whoever the thief/thieves were didn‚Äôt know how far I would go to take back what‚Äôs mine, so for the first 4 times, whenever it got lost, I used to scour the whole campus, every little spot in my night escapades at 3-4 AM, and found it in very different spots each time. Now, by this time, my cycle had a changed lock for the 4th time, and me being lazy, I only removed one of them from its middle frame and left the others hanging with the keys to all of them in my keychain. By the time that my cycle got lost for the last time, I will admit that my detective skills got a little rusty, and I started losing hope after 2 days of searching, but God, if they exist, gives ways to those who stay honorable in their path, and I got a call from a friend who knew the description of my cycle and said it was sitting idle, locked in a freaking ‚ÄòBALCONY‚Äô of some Hall 1 room. I ran at that second to that wing to find that the Dishonorable Thief Who Shall Not Be Named had brought it out and started claiming that it was always his in front of his friends. Who thought that all the locks I had put on my cycle would prove his dishonorable action? At last, I simply left with my cycle without any further discussion because‚Ä¶",
      "I was never really fond of taking responsibilities, and having an elder brother reduces the need for taking them upon yourself as well. However, I had determined to go on a self-journey, so I had to tackle this problem too. I saw MClub as the easiest target, but being a secretary there didn‚Äôt seem to make me feel responsible enough, so I had to bring out the big guns, and I opted for the easiest vertical of Techkriti, i.e., Web and App, since it only required basic knowledge of Software Development which I was already too fond of. I joined properly as a Senior Executive in February, and the fest was supposed to be held in May, so I had to do the unimaginable, and I embarked on the quest to revive the app of Techkriti without any prior knowledge of how to make one. That‚Äôs where I felt the adrenaline rush of having a task within a very short deadline in the domain that I had never touched, so I started learning, and I was able to make the app work for release by the start of the fest. I had never been happier of any of my achievements than that since it seemed like a revolt against my own self, and that‚Äôs when I started to taste the hint of taking up responsibility. I know people take PORs just to be involved with the people and not do the work assigned to them since it seems like a bore, but in my opinion, why are you doing something you know you won‚Äôt like just for the sake of a title? After that, my good senior friend/mentor Sahil Singh introduced me to GDSC, a totally new domain that was supposed to be run from the very beginning by us. I found that very thrilling and started working on making that community something worth remembering and found myself as the Lead the next year itself. I took up that position willingly to keep a regular supply of having a responsibility so that I don‚Äôt lose touch with it. Although, I believe these aren‚Äôt the real moments that defined this sense of responsibility. It was my circle of good friends, with whom I went on trips, that forced me into life-or-death situations where being the responsible one was the only choice.",
      "I might not have been the best at academics to make any comments on it, but man, I don‚Äôt think I have ever given up on any subject unless it‚Äôs ‚ÄòTheory of Computation.‚Äô Under no circumstances would my alternate reality self be able to perform well in that; all my hate is channeled to that course. But with hate, comes admiration, and all of that would go to ‚ÄòJapanese and Korean Cinematic Art.‚Äô I entered college with a vast movie knowledge base, and I could never find any group of people that resonated with that feeling and make me improve it further, but taking this course just fulfilled that desire of mine. The movies that I watched in that course opened my eyes about cinema, and ‚ÄòCure‚Äô by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is still one of the best movies I have ever watched. Third year is the best time for being at IITK when it comes to academics, because I have expanded my knowledge in a very real sense tenfold by the time it is finished, and I do not regret a second of it. Completing a fully functioning Python compiler (at least in front of the TA) is probably the best feeling I have ever felt regarding something academic in my life, shared with Manasvi and Sarthak, who made almost every course in my tenure feel like yet another hangout session.",
      "The final year at college is like a blessing when you are sorted and have nothing else to do. You start to make the most outrageous plans, like going for a Coldplay concert and then watching your favourite artists, like Green Day and Shawn Mendes, perform, all in Mumbai. Everything goes perfectly up until the end. But sometimes, the endings suck, and they might take up a huge chunk of money as well (iykyk). Adding on to that, the worst possible thing happened to me: I twisted my ankle on a damn TRAMPOLINEEE!!! The funny thing is that I and Deekshansh didn‚Äôt care much about that, and we started wall climbing, and guess who lost the race (name starts with D). But when I came back to college, I got hit with a huge ass plaster for a month, that you can see in the pictures, during my best time at college, when I only had 2 months left, final photoshoots were happening and the final Techkriti was supposed to happen in a week. I feel glad to have such supportive friends, who made me vibe to a Seedhe Maut concert and go wild jumping on one leg, who found ways for me to have all the possible fun I could.",
      "In the beginning of college, I used to be very adamant about my self-improvement drive, so I focused on interacting with anyone I met to the fullest, but never to the extent where I felt full talking to them. I made a lot of great friends, but looking back now, only a few stuck till the end, while some were not present in the beginning and became the closest by the end. I am grateful to find such amazing people in my wing, of every possible variety of personality type and on every spectrum of madness. I couldn‚Äôt manage my friendships really well in the first 2 years but that‚Äôs when I realised that having a smaller number of good friends is better than having a horde of connections. It was the mellow season of internship interviews that made me realise who sticks out their neck for you and stays present when you are at your worst, and that‚Äôs when I started to bring out my true side in front of my wingies as well. You don‚Äôt know what I would give for one more of our escapades to Ramaiya Dhaba at 3 AM at night, or walking around the whole campus with zero regrets. I think the best thing that this college has given me is introduce me to 2 very distinguished individuals in my life that have shaped my personality the most, Manasvi and Sarthak. They have been my ‚ÄòHashira‚Äô through thick and thin, helped me make my toughest decisions in an instant, and the main characters if my life was being telecasted like ‚ÄòThe Truman Show,‚Äô and they definitely made the boring part of college something to crave now that I have left the place. Maybe this part is the main motivation for me to write an AWL, because as I leave, I want to thank my true friends(you know who you are), because it is hard to say it in person without getting a comment on your manhood.",

      "In this 19th edition of As We Leave, Mohika Agarwal, a Y21 student from the department of Mechanical engineering, shares her journey of IIT Kanpur and lets us know what placeitholds in her heart. We discover how a place becomes more than just a location,it becomes the very fabric of who you are. This is a story about choices made and unmade, about finding your people in the most unexpected places. We come to know how the memories and experiences she has gained between the first and last glimpse of those bold letters at the gates of the campus left a lasting mark on her.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "27/05/2025",
      "Attempt no. 4 at writing this AWL. Have I finally got this? I still don‚Äôt know what I want to write. I vaguely know that I want to write about what this place does to you, what it has done to me and probably understand how it has done to me whatever it is that it has done to me.",
      "It is beautiful.A beautiful place,A beautiful experience,A beautiful maze.",
      "To define it as a place would be wrong. It is so much more. Yes, an experience. But is it just an experience? It is a collection of so many of those. No but as an experience it is a thing of the past for me now. It is so much more. It is still just as beautiful as it was when I was experiencing it. And it will stay beautiful for people who are currently experiencing it and will experience it in the future. It is differently beautiful for everyone. But in the end, it sure is beautiful. These As We Leaves themselves are a testament to this. So, let me try to define its beauty.",
      "As you enter the gates of IIT Kanpur,There you see it.First at the metro station,Then written in big bold letters right after the railway crossing.Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.",
      "And that is when you know it. It is all real. The dream is now real. You are here, and you are here to live it.",
      "And once you have entered, you stop noticing the big bold letters. You leave and enter from the same gate tens and hundreds of times throughout your stay and yet you don‚Äôt see them. You see the tiny bold letters on your question papers and answer scripts, and you still don‚Äôtseethem. You are too busy living it. It keeps you busy. I still don‚Äôt know whatitis. But it is something.",
      "For the past 4 years (okay 3.5) it kept me busy. With me there were about 1200 others who entered and lived it. 1200 is a huge number. So many others who are here to live the same dream? Is there enough space, enough opportunity, enough of everything for all of us here? These were a few questions in my mind when I first came to campus. These were maybe not as well-articulated back then as they are now. I am a much more articulate person now, again thanks to whatever ‚Äòit‚Äô is. Turns out, there was enough but also never enough of anything here. For example, there was never enough space on campus. There still isn‚Äôt (Vox promotion: Go read the Infra Review Series). But there also is enough space on campus. Enough space to accommodate everyone, and everyone‚Äôs dreams, and everyone‚Äôs wishes to do whatever it is that they wish to do. You are never really constrained, are you? You can do what you want, you can be a part of things you had previously given up for this beast called JEE, or things that you never even discovered about yourself before. It offers so much to you, and yet the choice of doing something or not doing something still lies with you. I chose to do a few things, and I also chose to not do a few things. And I am grateful for the choices I made.",
      "In the very first sem, I decided that I wanted to attend events and participate in activities of ELS, because it is the English Literary Society and I am an English Literature enthusiast. Simple enough right? It was and I am glad. ELS gave me not just ELS but also people that I cherish even today. It gave me some of my closest friends on campus, seniors, juniors, batchmates alike. OurELS orphanagenever felt like one.",
      "I also made similar choices in the sem that followed when we were on campus. Through ELS, I met people at Vox, discussed what the then situation was like for us freshers (wow I feel old) and how our movement was restricted. What soon followed was an invitation to attend one of Vox‚Äôs core group meetings and it was yet again a simple yes. From a CGM testing water quality of different water taps on campus to an editor leading articles, Vox is probably one of the reasons I can write the way I do today. Thanks to CGMs, article meets, ed-board meets, and parties, I met yet another set of people to cherish.",
      "",
      "And I made another choice of attending one random session that summer on ‚ÄòIntro to Consulting‚Äô and that led me to ICG. I remember discussing that session in the wing multiple times, and from there, deciding to fill the secy nomination, and then the leader nomination, it was one interesting journey. ICG gave me a lot of my learnings. How to structure things, how to plan things out, how to talk to people, how to present your points, and a lot more. It also gave me seniors I can still rush to for advice and batchmates and juniors I‚Äôve loved working with. Not just this, ICG also led to Inter IIT Tech. Over the span of 3 years, through ups and downs, highs and lows, I think it has given me a lot of learnings. I hope that the coming years see IITK going back to winning ways.",
      "",
      "But all of these were in some ways very direct offerings that IITK gave me. There are also the trivial ones that you seldom notice and appreciate. Like your academics. Let‚Äôs just say I survived the mech courses and loved doing the open electives a little more because of the people I did the courses with. Going through struggles of quizzes, assignments and exams definitely gives you people to cherish. And I‚Äôve found great people who have helped me selflessly through exams and the breakdowns they brought with them. Well surviving was all about mech, but my open electives have luckily been by choice, of things I wanted to actually study. Thanks to Suchitra ma‚Äôam and fem theory I am a much more curious person now when it comes to social situations around me. (Highly recommend doing a course under Suchitra ma‚Äôam, it is tough to keep up with the assignments but so worth it.)",
      "Another trivial offering is our halls. I met some of the most amazing girls in the corridors, mess and the canteen of Hall 6. These girls became my ride or die. The rooms have heard our laughs and cries alike. But the hall is so much more. The mess wali aunties have always been so sweet while serving rotis, and the floor wali aunties have initiated some very sweet conversations while cleaning our rooms and common spaces. And the places. The 5B balcony (in my 2ndyear) offered a very peaceful view. Something about sitting there would calm you after a stressful day. The 3rdfloor connector (3rdyear) and the windows we could sit in, had become a cocoon on days I wanted to hide away in peace. And by the time I reached 5D (4thyear), I think I had become used to both laughing and crying in my own room and running to my friends‚Äô rooms when it was tough to cry alone. I‚Äôll miss being able to run to my people to simply just cry, without any questions. They would embrace you in a warm hug and let you cry your heart out without asking why. Who would do that in bustling cities for you?",
      "",
      "Come to think of it, almost every nook and corner on campus holds a memory. Some small, some big but all beautiful. I think a lot of it comes from the way we can be in these spaces. There is just so much freedom, if I can call it that? I could sit on a random bus stand, or a bench or on the OAT stairs and have any kind of conversation with a friend. I could for that matter just sit on the road if I wanted to. I could go to rooftops (coyly of course) and watch a beautiful sunrise after a calm night with my people. I could do anything and everything, yet no one would stop me (mostly). What is more important is thatIwould not stop myself. I could be myself, and for most parts not think about what others are thinking of me in these situations. Now, while I won‚Äôt even have the luxury to randomly sit on the road, I would also probably stop myself. But I hope I can still have places and people and moreitswhere I can be myself without holding back.",
      "Thisithas another unique feature. This 1100 acres of land, breeds familiarity in its grounds. You could walk on the remotest path, sit in the quietest corner, and yet recognise a familiar face. What lies outside this utopia, is a world of unknowns. Unknown faces, unknown paths, unknown corners. This familiarity that the campus offered was almost calming. You were never too worried about things that you would often worry about outside. That is to some degrees freeing. It lets you be yourself and enjoy with the people around you a little more than you could outside. I think coming back to campus would always offer this freedom from worrying and for that I‚Äôll probably want to come back.",
      "In the last few days, as I started meeting people for the last time before we leave, and then when people started to actually leave, it was hard. People leave a very strong mark on you. You remember certain things about them which they might not. They remember things about you that you might not. What I was before I came here to what I amas I leave, this difference has a lot of people in it. Over time, you adopt certain slangs and mannerisms from the people around you. And in moments you use it, you remember them most organically and so I hope I would. I‚Äôll try to stay in touch and meet these people too. But it‚Äôll be different. The access you had to these people so easily and organically will be gone. Here‚Äôs a thought I had as friends were leaving:",
      "If your life was an iPhone, the end of college probably takes away your airdrop feature. You no longer have the privilege of proximity.",
      "And this hurts. But then when you think of it, you never knew these people before. Now you do. And now, you have these people in your life. Which is great. Because you will find them when it matters and so will they. I think my purpose is served. I have to some extent understood what this has done to me and how it has done so. I hope it changes you for the better too.",
      "And then, after all these goodbyes,as you leave campus,you see it again.Written in big bold letters rightbeforethe railway crossing.Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.",
      "And that is when you know it. It is all real. The dream is now real. You were here, and you have lived it.",

      "In this 18th edition ofAs We Leave, Rohan Virmani, a Y21 student from the Department of Chemical Engineering, takes us through a deeply personal and candid reflection on his IIT Kanpur journey. His story begins with the silent struggle of JEE preparation during the COVID lockdown, leading to an online first year that gradually transitioned into vibrant campus life. Rohan chronicles his experiences through the highs and lows of balancing academics with diverse extracurriculars, from national-level tennis to leading the Music Club. He shares moments of self-doubt and broken friendships, alongside the triumphs of major projects, a challenging corporate internship, and the profound bonds forged with friends and mentors. Rohan‚Äôs narrative is a testament to perseverance, the importance of trusting one‚Äôs intuition, and the transformative power of finding one‚Äôs purpose and community, ultimately concluding with the bittersweet farewell to a place that gave him ‚Äúa voice, a purpose, a family, and a story‚Äù.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Before IIT Kanpur, there was a dark, uncertain stretch. I prepared for JEE in the middle of the COVID lockdown‚Äîa time of silence, screens, self-doubt, and survival. There were no classrooms, no coaching centers, no fixed schedules. I often found myself wondering: Am I really good enough for this? The isolation tested me in ways I hadn‚Äôt expected. But I made it. I stepped into IITK not with full confidence, but with quiet hope‚Äîand that was enough to begin.",
      "My first year at IIT Kanpur didn‚Äôt begin at a campus gate or a hostel room. It began on a laptop screen. We were the COVID batch‚ÄîY21‚Äîand for the first few months of college, home was the classroom, and Zoom was the auditorium. There were no corridors buzzing with chaos, no lecture halls to get lost in, no canteen chai at midnight. Everything we were told college would be‚Ä¶ was on hold.",
      "Still, I wanted to feel something. So I showed up to everything I could‚Äîorientation meets, random batch calls, informal student interactions‚Äîjust to get a sense of what this community might be like. As a singer, music became my gateway into connection. I sang at meets, open mics, even casual chats. Soon, people started to recognize me. ‚ÄúThat guy with long hair who sings.‚Äù The support I received online was something I hadn‚Äôt expected. Instagram became my stage, and it felt like I was becoming part of a shared identity, despite the distance. Even seniors knew me by name‚Äîthanks to the power of music and social media.",
      "But academics? That was another story.",
      "Online classes didn‚Äôt feel real. We were told about strict proctoring. It made exams feel like landmines, and yet, a strange casualness crept in. I couldn‚Äôt get myself to focus. Lectures blurred into each other. Motivation came in waves and disappeared just as quickly. I was ‚Äúin IIT Kanpur,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in college. Still, I began to learn -not just course material, but how to manage myself in a world without structure. More than that, I began to understand just how incredibly talented and brilliant the people around me were. From Olympiad rankers to kids who‚Äôd built startups before arriving here, IITK was a different league altogether. That realization was humbling. It stripped away the comfort of being a ‚Äútopper‚Äù and replaced it with quiet awe.",
      "And yet, we made space for fun too.",
      "I still remember the prank mail someone sent‚Äîpretending to be from the EC, accusing people of cheating. I fell for it. We all did. And we laughed about it for days.",
      "We had midnight gossip sessions, theories about when we‚Äôd be called to campus, and emotional support group-style venting about classes. We found friends in people we hadn‚Äôt even seen in person. It was strange, beautiful, and confusing‚Äîall at once.",
      "One of the most comforting structures during this time was the Counselling Service. It wasn‚Äôt just an orientation program‚Äîit was a system of support. Every fresher had a Student Guide (SG), who we called our Baapu. Their SG was our Dada, and we even had to find our Amma. What started as jokes and memes eventually became real connections. These seniors helped us navigate everything from course selections to random emotional breakdowns at 2 AM.",
      "And then it finally happened.",
      "On April 2nd, 2022, the Y21 batch arrived on campus. After months of online guessing, I was finally here. The sun felt different. The buildings, real. The people, alive. The offline orientation began, and I performed on stage for the first time‚Äîsinging and beatboxing in front of a real crowd, feeling the weight of real applause. I still remember the rush, the nerves, the silence before the first note. That performance marked something for me. It wasn‚Äôt just a song. It was a transition.",
      "That orientation period was full of moments. I participated in CS events like ‚ÄúReel to Real‚Äù, which I ended up winning. I made more friends, explored more corners of the campus, and stepped deeper into the cultural life here. I even took part in the freshers‚Äô dance showcase‚Äîa performance that would go on to cross over 10 million views online. It felt like a strange mix of virality and vulnerability, but it made me feel seen. Academically, I was able to maintain the CPI I had secured in the online semester. But now, with offline life in full swing, time management became real. Between rehearsals, hangouts, assignments, and figuring out where Lecture Hall Complex actually was, I learned how to juggle chaos. I also started playing tennis again, slowly reconnecting with the sport that had once made me a national-level player back in school. That first hit of the ball on IITK‚Äôs courts was pure nostalgia.",
      "By the end of the year, I wasn‚Äôt just adjusting‚ÄîI was living. I had my friend groups, a growing sense of identity, and a feeling that I had space to grow. It wasn‚Äôt perfect. I had bad days. I had moments of doubt. But I was starting to believe that I could build a life here‚Äînot just pass through it.",
      "‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a fresher reading this‚Äîknow that it‚Äôs okay to feel lost. We all do, even if no one says it. But if you give yourself the chance, this place will give you people, memories, and meaning you didn‚Äôt know you needed.‚Äù",
      "",
      "",
      "If the first year was about arriving, second year was about becoming‚Äîand also, about breaking.",
      "The year kicked off with what felt like a storm of expectations. Every club was calling for secretary nominations, the councils were recruiting, and people were beginning to shape their college identities. And me? I was everywhere.",
      "I applied‚Äîand got selected‚Äîinto the Music Club, the Finance and Analytics Club, and Vox, the journalism body. I was also involved in Techkriti(our tech fest) and simultaneously resumed playing lawn tennis, where I got selected for the Inter IIT 2022 team. But with all that excitement came an impossible question: How much can I stretch myself before something snaps?",
      "One of the first big choices I had to make was between Dance Club and Music Club. I wasn‚Äôt formally trained in either, but I‚Äôd enjoyed both. And while I could move decently on stage, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the feeling of singing‚Äîthat rush. I chose Music, trusting that I could dance anytime in life, but music at this scale? This was my window. But the joy of making it into all these spaces quickly collided with schedule clashes, pressure, and sacrifices. That hit me the hardest when I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to represent the Music Club at the cult meet. Why? Because of tennis commitments. That moment stung. It felt unfair. Like I was being punished for being involved in too many things. Seniors helped me navigate the emotions, explaining how club dynamics, selection processes, and internal politics work.",
      "That‚Äôs when I learned: sometimes, you don‚Äôt get rejected because you weren‚Äôt good enough. You just didn‚Äôt fit the puzzle that day.",
      "Still, I gave my best to tennis. We went to IIT Delhi for Inter IIT, and even though we didn‚Äôt win a medal, we fought hard and reached the quarterfinals. The training phase brought back that old sporting discipline‚Äîmorning practice, controlled routine, eating right, sleeping early‚Äîall while still juggling club meetings and deadlines. It was intense. But it reminded me of who I had been once, and what I was still capable of.",
      "Meanwhile, I was also functioning across three student councils.",
      "‚óè Under SnT, I was a Finance Club secretary.",
      "‚óè Under MnC, I was active in Music Club.",
      "‚óè Under GnS, I was repping tennis.",
      "It was insane. My calendar was packed beyond logic, and I was running on fumes most days. But I was learning‚Äîabout how IITK works, about how people work, and about how I work under pressure.",
      "And then, life threw its first really tough test.",
      "Some of my closest friendships began to crack and fall apart. Misunderstandings. College differences. Hurtful things said, unsaid, assumed. I felt like the ground under me was shifting. For someone who had always been surrounded by strong support systems, this was hard. And to make it worse, I had started getting mocked and criticized. Not by strangers‚Äîbut by people I had shared things with. People who once cheered for me.I started becoming the topic of side jokes. I felt watched. Judged. And for the first time since arriving at IITK, I felt alone in a crowd.It shook me. I began to overthink everything‚Äîevery word I said, every event I performed at, every time I raised my hand in a class. It was like my confidence had slipped through a crack I didn‚Äôt notice forming.",
      "But here‚Äôs the thing: I kept going.",
      "Somewhere in that phase, a few people reminded me of who I was. They sat with me, listened, laughed, challenged my spirals. They helped me breathe again. And slowly, I found newer friendships, deeper connections, and more importantly‚Äîa better version of myself.",
      "But then came another hit.",
      "I had applied to become a Student Guide (SG), I wasn‚Äôt selected. When I found out why, it felt deeply unfair. That night was a quiet one. Not dramatic. Just‚Ä¶ heavy. I again doubted myself and did not feel motivated to continue and apply for any 3rd year Por, but with a lot of self thoughts I rose and thought of not letting down myself and my 2nd year struggles. I was not very confident but what I didn‚Äôt know then was that something big was coming. After a long chain of events leading to a very emotionally draining interview, I was selected as the Coordinator of the Music Club. The very club where I once nervously auditioned for a small spot in the line-up‚Ä¶ I was now going to lead.",
      "That feeling? Unmatched. I still remember sitting in the club room after it became official, looking at the walls, thinking about all the times I had sat there frustrated, inspired, angry, or in awe. And now‚ÄîI had the keys. The rest of the semester passed in a strange combination of exhaustion, growth, and closure. I wasn‚Äôt everywhere anymore. I had my focus, my people, and a clearer understanding of what mattered.I could have gone on to become the Tennis captain‚ÄîI had a shot. But once again, I chose music. And my tennis captain didn‚Äôt just understand that‚Äîhe supported it. That moment of respect meant more than any selection letter.",
      "I ended second year with fewer people, but stronger bonds. Friends became family. My wingmates, my club teammates‚Äîwe had all been through our own versions of chaos, and now we stood together, wiser.",
      "‚ÄúThis year taught me that you will lose people. You will be misjudged. You will doubt yourself. But if you keep showing up‚Äîwith integrity, with passion, and with patience‚Äîyou will find your place. And more importantly, you‚Äôll find your people.‚Äù",
      "",
      "The summer after my second year was not a break. It was a battleground‚Äîwith three fronts: Music Club leadership, a SURGE research internship, and the most stressful thing on campus at the time‚Äîinternship preparation.",
      "On one hand, I had just stepped in as the Coordinator of the Music Club. That wasn‚Äôt just a title‚Äîit came with legacy, pressure, and expectations. I began reaching out to the juniors, setting the tone, building systems, and shaping a vision for the club. I launched new initiatives‚Äîsmall event ideas, experiments to test how we could revive our presence. But it wasn‚Äôt all strategy and spreadsheets. I remember nights spent in the club room‚Äîsitting with secretaries, cleaning the space together, getting familiarised. We celebrated the clean-up with treats, stayed back to watch movies, cracked jokes, and started building something real.",
      "It felt like more than leadership. It felt like home.",
      "But that was just one side of the summer.",
      "I had also taken up a SURGE research project under a Chemical Engineering professor. The topic was exciting‚Äîself-propelled particle motion‚Äîand it sounded like something that would challenge me. I worked under two PhD scholars. One helped me with the code‚Äîwe worked on data analysis of particle trajectories. The other had me do actual experimental prep in the lab. It should‚Äôve been a fantastic experience. But the professor, unfortunately, was almost entirely absent. We didn‚Äôt even meet him properly until the last day. That lack of engagement left a bad taste, and I made up my mind not to continue the work post-SURGE. Still, I learned a lot‚Äîabout how research happens, about how to work with teams, and most importantly, about what kind of work doesn‚Äôt excite me.",
      "And then came the real mental war‚Äîinternship preparation.",
      "I knew one thing with certainty: I didn‚Äôt want to do coding. Not long-term. Not even short-term. But in IIT, especially during internship season, coding becomes the default religion. So I followed the crowd‚Äîlearned DSA, did competitive programming, solved problems, sat for mock tests. And while I could do it, I just‚Ä¶ hated it. The pressure got worse when I wasn‚Äôt even shortlisted for the top three consulting firms I was aiming for. I had genuinely believed I had a good shot. And when those doors didn‚Äôt open, I panicked.",
      "‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not good enough for the other firms too? What if this was my one shot?‚Äù",
      "The frustration grew. The stress mounted. And one day, I just cracked. I broke down on a video call with my family‚Äîtold them I couldn‚Äôt do this anymore. That I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, and that I was scared. Their response? Unshaken trust. They told me they believed in me‚Äîwhatever I chose, whatever I failed at, whatever I tried again. That gave me the strength to finally listen to myself. I dropped DSA. I pivoted to analyst and techno-managerial roles‚Äîroles where I could speak, ideate, analyze, present. It felt more natural. I began preparing for resumes, interviews, group discussions. I stayed up late practicing stories, building frameworks, understanding what made me different‚Äînot just employable.",
      "And then, as summer reached its end, the internship tests began. The atmosphere on campus shifted‚Äîtense, electric, desperate.",
      "I gave a few tests. Waited. Then came ITC.",
      "I cleared the resume shortlist. There was an online test a few days before Day 0. And then came the big night.",
      "On Day 0, I was slotted for a Group Discussion (GD) round with 8 people. We entered the room, gave our best in that 10‚Äì15 minute chaos of ideas, buzzwords, and speaking-time politics. It ended at around 9 PM.",
      "And then came the wait.",
      "We were told the callback list would be out by 11 PM. At 11:30, I wasn‚Äôt called. I assumed I was out. Disappointed, I walked over to the Music Club. Just wanted to sit, maybe distract myself. Then headed back to my room around 3 AM, ready to sleep off the sadness.",
      "And then it happened.",
      "3:15 AM. My phone rang. It was my POC.",
      "‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the waitlist. You have your technical round in 15 minutes. Be ready.‚Äù",
      "I was in shock. I had no prep materials. No suit laid out. I splashed water on my face, ran out, and headed to the interview venue.",
      "I was tired. But alert. And when I entered the room, I did the one thing I knew best‚ÄîI told a story. I steered the conversation to my SURGE project, broke down the logic, and explained how I handled problem-solving in a messy research environment.",
      "They nodded. Asked smart follow-ups. I handled them.",
      "That round went from 4 AM to about 5 AM.",
      "We were told that a second technical round would happen in the morning for those who cleared the first. The next shortlist would be released around 7 AM.",
      "I didn‚Äôt sleep. I couldn‚Äôt.",
      "Instead, I revised my core chemical engineering concepts and prepared for the final battle.",
      "At 7 AM, the list came out. I was in.",
      "At around 8:30 AM, I reached the ITC office. There, I was met by the HR Ma‚Äôam, who casually asked about my music, my tennis, and everything that wasn‚Äôt academic. It set the tone for what was to come. Then I walked into the second technical round‚Äîa formal interview in an oval office. I was nervous, but ready. They threw a few trick questions at me. I didn‚Äôt get flustered. I pulled out a sheet, drew structured diagrams, built a logical flow, and talked them through my approach‚Äînot just my answers.",
      "I could see them nodding. Interested. Engaged. I stepped out knowing I had left it all on the table. And around 11 AM, the results were announced.",
      "I was selected.",
      "That moment still feels unreal.",
      "From the waitlist to the final selection‚Äîfrom the edge of self-doubt to standing among the first to get an intern on Day 1 morning‚Äîit was a journey I‚Äôll never forget.",
      "‚ÄúThat summer taught me many things. But above all, it taught me this: Trust your discomfort. Your intuition. Your chaos. Sometimes what breaks you is only making room for what defines you.‚Äù",
      "The fifth semester started with a strange mix of emotions. On paper, things were going well‚ÄîI had just finished my Day 1 intern and had a solid chance at a PPO later from ITC since they had a good history for it and so I felt a little secured. But around me, things were different. A lot of my closest friends hadn‚Äôt gotten internships yet. They were deep in prep mode, focused, grinding. So while I was free academically, I couldn‚Äôt celebrate. It just didn‚Äôt feel right.",
      "While my friends stayed buried in coding sheets and prep groups, I spent more time at the Music Club, now as the Coordinator. That was the one role where I could truly give my all. I‚Äôd just finished one of the best semesters of my life with a 9-point SPI and a CPI around 8.4, but this time, my priorities shifted. I let go of the academic push and focused more on making sure our club‚Äôs legacy stood strong.",
      "We had a packed semester‚Äîthree to four major club events, preparation for Antaragni in October, and the Inter IIT Cultural Meet coming in December. Days became a routine: waking up, attending a few classes, rushing to the club room, staying there till midnight or later, planning events, training the juniors, figuring logistics, fighting over song parts, and trying to hold it all together.",
      "But leadership comes with its price. Somewhere during that stretch, I started having fallouts with a few seniors. Some of those bonds‚Äîones I had respected deeply‚Äîgot complicated. I also realized that leading people isn‚Äôt about being liked. And in a creative club, where ego, passion, and politics run high, things can get messy. With secretaries, too, the equation varied. Sometimes it felt like I was carrying everything alone. I tried acting tougher than I was, but it drained me. Amid this, friendships I held close started to slip. College differences, misunderstandings, ego clashes‚Äîthings I thought would never change, did. I began overthinking everything. For a while, I was just functioning. Managing events, attending meetings, planning competitions, keeping up appearances‚Äîbut inside, I was worn out.",
      "And then came Antaragni. Despite the chaos, the club came together for it. We practiced like mad. The energy was high, the expectations were huge. And somehow, we pulled it off. For the first time in years, Music Club won third place at Antaragni. I still remember standing with the others, looking at the results and realizing: We did it.",
      "That event happened around my birthday, and in a strange way, it felt like the club had given me a gift. All those hours spent learning, scolding, mentoring‚Äîit meant something. I had also worked with some seniors to compose an original song for one of the competitions. That process gave me more confidence as a composer and collaborator‚Äîit taught me that creation can happen even amidst chaos.",
      "But success came at a cost. All the work took a toll on academics. My attendance dropped in a couple of courses, and I ended up with my lowest ever SPI‚Äî7.5. That one hurt. Since school and through JEE prep, I had always been proud of my discipline. I‚Äôd kept it together. I had held the balance between passion and academics. And now, I felt like I had let myself down. That sting stayed with me. And it gave birth to a silent resolve:",
      "‚Äú I will work hard in the next sem. I will fix my CPI.‚Äù",
      "Because I wanted to graduate with First Division Distinction, that 8.5 CPI. I was sitting at 8.4. So close. But it felt far.",
      "This was also the time I found someone special. Alongside all these hardships, the club gave me someone to share my thoughts with , to share my time with and to feel complete after a long time since I lost most of my closest people last semester. She started off as my secy but that bond grew stronger.",
      "And then came the Inter IIT Cultural Meet in December. This time, things were different. We weren‚Äôt just some team‚Äîwe were a unit. My batchmates, my juniors‚Äîeveryone I‚Äôd grown with was now performing at the highest stage for our club. It was personal. It was emotional. We trained with insane discipline. Weeks of rehearsals. Planning every transition, every note, every lineup. Everyone questioned everything. The pressure was brutal. But we believed in our sound. When we arrived at IIT Kharagpur, we knew we weren‚Äôt just representing IIT Kanpur‚Äîwe were representing ourselves, our club, and our journey.",
      "And then‚Äîwe delivered.",
      "We won overall second position. A historic moment for the club. I was part of the medal-winning band performance, singing on stage, watching the crowd light up.",
      "I‚Äôll never forget the moment my former Coordinator‚Äîwho had mentored me in my early days‚Äîsaw me perform live. Afterward, he came up to me and said he was proud. That hit different. Because I had once stood when he was performing‚Äîwatching, learning, dreaming.",
      "Now, I was living it.",
      "We returned to campus exhausted but glowing. The club had achieved something big. The juniors had grown. The seniors were proud. The bonds we had built, especially during those long practice nights‚Äîthey became family.",
      "‚ÄúThat year taught me that even when everything seems to be slipping‚Äîacademics, people, peace‚Äîif you hold on long enough, something will bring you back to yourself.‚Äù",
      "By the time I stepped into the actual internship phase, I thought I was ready. But nothing truly prepares you for the real thing‚Äîyour first experience in a corporate, industrial setting, with real people, real expectations, and no comfort zone.When I received my posting, I was skeptical.Pollachi‚Äîa quiet town near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.I‚Äôd expected remote locations; we all knew the ITC Foods division often posted interns at factory sites. But still‚Äîgoing there alone, not knowing the local language, made it feel daunting. I couldn‚Äôt shake off the uneasiness. Before that, though, came the corporate induction. I landed in Kolkata for the main ITC induction, and it blew my mind. We stayed in a 5-star hotel, suited up, surrounded by peers from across the country. For two days, we walked through ITC‚Äôs history, legacy projects, work culture, and impactful internships from previous years. It was grand. Inspiring. Intense. And in its own way, a reward for having made it here. But just as I was settling into that feeling, I was on the move again‚Äîthis time to Bangalore for the division-specific induction for Foods. It was more grounded, more technical, and gave us a preview of what our roles would entail.And then‚ÄîI flew to Pollachi.From metropolitan hotels to the foothills of the Valparai hills, the contrast was sharp. But the place was stunning. Green. Serene. Alive with nature. The air felt different. My stay was comfortable, well arranged, and the ITC team ensured I had what I needed. But there was one thing no one could prepare me for what came next. I was alone in my location. I had no batchmate, no close friend around. And the language barrier made even small things‚Äîlike ordering food‚Äîan adventure. Most meals were sambar-rice, and north Indian food was barely available. Communication with the shopkeepers, auto drivers, and even the factory staff was an ongoing effort in gestures and guesses. But soon, I found rhythm. My posting was at ITC‚Äôs candy factory, and I had been assigned three projects‚Äîeach requiring technical understanding, analysis, and problem-solving. Unlike many internships, this wasn‚Äôt shadow work. I wasn‚Äôt fetching data for someone else‚Äôs spreadsheet. I was expected to understand the entire production line, identify areas of improvement, and work hands-on with 2‚Äì3 dedicated machines.I spent long hours in the factory‚Äîsix days a week, often 10+ hours a day. I had only 2‚Äì3 off days throughout those two months. I got my hands dirty. I stood next to machines, observed processes, took notes, questioned operators, made modifications, and interacted directly with the ITC team on-site. This was real engineering. Real decision-making. And it came withfreedom. That was the most surprising part‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt micromanaged. I was trusted. And that trust made me push harder. But the weight of the work wasn‚Äôt just physical.Every night, I‚Äôd come back to my room‚Äîalone. There were no friends to decompress with. No late-night wing talk. Just me, my notes, and my phone. I stayed in touch with my family and a few close friends. Video calls kept me sane. I‚Äôd hear about their cities, their projects, their fun weekends, and I‚Äôd quietly note how different my internship experience was. Not better or worse. Just different.And somewhere in that quiet, in that distance, I grew up a little.My lens changed. I started to see things differently. The way teams worked, the real-world challenges, the stakes of even small changes on the floor‚Äîit all felt more serious, more meaningful than any classroom problem I‚Äôd solved. The wait for PPO results would stretch on. And I was anxious. But no matter what the result would be, I knew this much:I had shown up. I had delivered. And more than anything, I had proven to myself that I could walk into the unknown‚Äîand come out stronger. At the end of the internship, I underwent six rounds of PPO reviews. Each review pushed me to justify my work‚Äînot just technically, but in terms of impact. I had to think like a professional, not a student. And that shift‚Ä¶ it changedeverything. This wasn‚Äôt just a project. This was a preview of life after college. Of real work. Real people. Real constraints. And real contribution. By the time I wrapped up and left Pollachi, I wasn‚Äôt the same person who had nervously googled ‚Äúwhere is Pollachi‚Äù two months earlier. I came home tired, tanned, but fulfilled. And just the next month my managerthere contacted me and told me that my work actually really helped. I felt proud.",
      "I returned to campus after the summer internship in Pollachi with a head full of questions and a heart full of hope. I had given it my all. Six PPO reviews, three full-fledged projects, solo living, factory floor hustle‚ÄîI believed I had a chance. But I didn‚Äôt know for sure. That made the beginning of seventh semester‚Ä¶ strange. Around me, people were preparing for placements like their life depended on it. The stress was everywhere. Notes were being passed around. Juniors were huddled with seniors, and even the chai guy knew which company was visiting on which day.But I was in this weird limbo.On one hand, I hadn‚Äôt received my PPO yet. On the other, I didn‚Äôt want to do coding, and I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to grind like that for a fallback role. I had already made up my mind‚Äîif not ITC, I would only go for analyst or consulting roles. So while others ran to classes and mock tests, I found myself in the Music Club, trying to stay grounded. A part of me felt guilty‚Äîwatching my friends drown in anxiety while I stayed away from the heat. But I also understood that guilt wouldn‚Äôt help anyone.And then came August.It was intern season for my juniors now. I had taken so many mock interviews and sessions during my own summer‚Äîsharing tips, clearing doubts, reviewing resumes. Now, I watched my juniors go through their own versions of the Day 0 grind. I was there when some of themcracked it. And I was there when some didn‚Äôt. Their journeys reminded me of my own breakdowns, my own panic calls to family‚Äîand how I came out of that storm.",
      "And then, on August 23rd, it happened. I got the call. PPO confirmed.",
      "I still remember staring at the screen for a few seconds, just absorbing those words. I deleted all my resume drafts that night and had a sigh of relief .But the journey wasn‚Äôt over‚Äînot even close. Because now came the time to be there for others.",
      "As placements neared, campus changed. You could feel it in the air. People walk faster. Eyes more tired. Friendships turning tense. Everyone became their own island‚Äîfocused, driven, scared. I helped where I could. Reviewed resumes. Held mock GDs. Offered company-specific insights from my internship. But the emotional part was heavier. Some of my closest friends hadn‚Äôt secured PPOs. And they were now staring into the abyss of Day 0 with all its uncertainty. We tried to keep each other afloat. And then December came.",
      "No sleep. Constant refreshes of interview lists. Running between Hall-13 wings. Group chats exploding. Seniors being spammed. People getting ghosted mid-process. People breaking down. People hugging after selections. People walking alone after rejections. It was madness. And even though I wasn‚Äôt in it‚ÄîI felt everything. I had friends across thespectrum. And I saw all of it‚Äîsuccess, bitterness, redemption, guilt. There was no space for grudges anymore. Old fights dissolved.The batch came together.I still remember the nights when my closest friends got placed. Some cried, the others just sat still. Those nights, we didn‚Äôt sleep. We just sat in the wing corridor, talked about our journeys, and realized that the scariest part was almost over. One week later, most people were sorted. Some still had interviews coming. But the peak storm had passed.",
      "We made plans for Goa, laughed again like old times, and for the first time in months‚Äîbreathed freely.",
      "My musical journey wasn‚Äôt over yet . Because one last Inter IIT Cultural Meet remained. And it meant everything to me. This time, we had the best team I could have hoped for‚Äîmy closest batchmates, juniors I mentored, friends I had fought and laughed with. Everyone was fully involved, and we wanted to give it our all. We trained like never before‚Äîcomplex songs,difficult transitions, high-risk arrangements. We questioned everything. But we trusted each other. And when we reached the host campus, we walked in knowing‚Äîthis would be our last time representing IITK together.I performed a song I had written myself‚Äîmy own lyrics, my own emotion, poured out in front of 22 IITs. I held the mic with every ounce of presence I had. I had become the guy who holds the stage. That was my role. That was who I was.We didn‚Äôt win this time. But that didn‚Äôt matter.The respect we received, the cheers we heard, the pride we felt‚Äîit told us everything. Our juniors had grown. Our team had bonded. Our legacy was in good hands.‚ÄúSometimes, you don‚Äôt need validation to know you‚Äôve done something right.‚Äù",
      "The final semester came quietly. Almost everyone was placed. There were no real classes anymore. People were chill. The masks had dropped. The race was over. But I still had one unfinished promise‚Äîto graduate with a CPI of 8.5. I was close. Very close. I got my highest ever spi of 9.4 last sem.I just had to maintain that. So I carefully picked 4 courses and a UGproject with a professor I had worked with before. I stayed focused, not paranoid.And the Music Club still remained. I wasn‚Äôt Coordinator anymore, but I was still performing. Still guiding juniors. Still living it till the end.In January we had our second last event. I was supposed to perform ‚ÄúBandeh‚Äù‚Äîa special performance with my former co-coordinator. It would‚Äôve been our first duet. A final send-off. But due to time constraints, we couldn‚Äôt perform it. That hurt. It felt incomplete.But fate had other plans.In April, just weeks before farewells, we finally performed ‚ÄúBandeh‚Äù in our last music club event ever, The ME‚Äô25.All four Coordinators‚Äîtogether‚Äîfor the first and last time.And that one line‚Äî‚ÄúArre ruk jaa re bandeh‚Äù‚Äîechoed inside me like a goodbye.I also performed ‚ÄúBheegi Bheegi‚Äù with my closest friend from the club‚Äîthe same friend who had been my anchor all these years. It was the song we had dreamt of singing together since first year. It wasn‚Äôt easy. If you know, you know. But we pulled it off. Our juniors stood, clapped, and honored our journey. The club paid its respects.And then came the year-end villa party. It was wild. Emotional. Chaotic. Perfect. (Details? DM me. That night belongs to us.)",
      "March brought the Goa trip‚Äîour Ache Launde gang of seven. I was one of the planners, and I even got us custom printed T-shirts with our silhouettes and a tagline that ended up going viral among the batch. The trip itself? What happens in Goa‚Ä¶ stays in Goa.",
      "April brought closure. Old first-year friends came over. We celebrated Holi at my home with my family. It felt like all timelines‚Äîpast, present, and future‚Äîhad converged for a moment of stillness.The last fest.The last class.The last walkAnd finally‚ÄîEndsems. These felt different. We all knew somewhere that this will be the last time we are studying here in this campus, the last time we will go to the library. The last time we will put in all nighters to study peacefully yet in a hurry. So many mixed emotions, I don‚Äôt think I can ever explain to myself even what I felt in that week of studying.I gave my project presentation after the last written endsem and remember being frustrated since all of my friends were free while I was there completing this project. But then that was also over. I packed slowly over the following week. Slept on the floor with all my friends, all the beds pushed together. These were heartbreaking times. Some heartfelt conversations, times of actually meeting and sorting out fights with old friends.Then came the goodbye to my closest person. She was there with me through all my highs and lows and knew me the most at that particular point of time. It was such a great feeling of having someone like a family, away from home. I will be always grateful . Realising that I could no longer spend time with her within the campus, broke me.Alongside all this was Scribble Day, Graduation Dinner, Dance Extravaganza and of course the batch photoshoot. The batch video, I remember doing with the music club and my Ache Launde. Just some lazy seniors, 7am in the morning, full suits and shades, dancing in the middle of nowhere. All these things were just some ways to actually be together for the last time.",
      "Then the last week went by so slowly, it was so hard to pass every second with the thought of leaving all this. Just the night before leaving , I had received my final SPI‚Äî8.8.",
      "Which meant‚Ä¶I had done it.8.5 CPI. First Division Distinction. For which I worked so hard. It finally paid off. A full circle with second year Rohan who wanted this.",
      "And on May 14th-2025, I stood at the main gate. Hugged every friend. Every junior. Every memory. And I cried for one last time and left this humble abode and along with it every memory I made and cherished here.‚ÄúIIT Kanpur took a lot. My energy. My comfort. My certainty. But it gave me back far more. A voice. A purpose. A family. And a story.‚ÄùThank you, IITK.Virmanisigning off",

      "In this17th edition ofAs We Leave, Talin Gupta, a Y21 student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, takes us through a whimsical yet heartfelt reflection on his IIT Kanpur journey told through a conversation with his past self. What begins as a moment of indecision between IITK and IITD unfolds into a vivid exploration of campus life: the thrill of fests, the chaos of GPLs, long cycling nights, and unexpected friendships forged over random club meets and shared projects. Talin‚Äôs story is a reminder that college is more than just courses and deadlines, it‚Äôs about showing up, getting out of your comfort zone, and saying yes to the little things.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "‚ÄúBeta Josaa ki deadline hai parso, kab karega decide?‚Äù my father says as I sit beside him for breakfast. ‚ÄúDekhte hain,‚Äù I give the same response as the last three times, and he is clearly irritated.",
      "Hey guys. This is Talin, and I just cleared JEE Advanced 2021. The results came a couple of days back,(Ab toh life sorted hai). I have been confused between IITK CSE and IITD integrated (5-year) CSE. ‚ÄúOkay, IITD it is,‚Äù I think, after hanging up from a long discussion with my coaching mentor.‚Äù Something doesn‚Äôt feel right, though.",
      "Anyways, I have decided to sleep on it. ‚ÄúGood night, sweet dreams,‚Äù as I enter the world of dreams.",
      "‚Ä¶",
      "Hey, where am I? Is this a dream? I haven‚Äôt seen this place before.",
      "It is night time. Under some lights, I can see a stage, a set of big stairs in front of it, and the night sky. Someone is coming. I should ask him. As he comes closer, I realize it‚Äôs none other than me! He looks like a grown-up version of myself.",
      "I step away in shock. ‚ÄúRelax, listen to me,‚Äù he says politely. ‚ÄúHow is this possible? Is this real? No, I am dreaming. It‚Äôs just in my head,‚Äù I stammer in utter confusion. ‚ÄúOf course it is happening inside your head, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?‚Äù I‚Äôm now pretty sure this is indeed me. I would never let an opportunity to quote Dumbledore slip away.",
      "Older Me:I am the version of you that decided to go to IITK, and I thank my past self every day for that decision. I will tell you how great it has been, and you can decide for yourself if you would like to do the same. The place you are standing right now is one of my favourites, the OAT. I spend countless late nights here with my friends ‚Äî during fests, GC events, and whatnot. You don‚Äôt know these lingos yet; let me tell you: [‚Ä¶ (skipped details) ‚Ä¶]",
      "(I could sense some heaviness in his voice. His expressions as he talked about college were similar to mine whenever I talk about my school. It was a mix of sadness, for it was coming to an end, and happiness, for it had been good enough to make him feel that way.)",
      "Me:Damn, IITK has some really crazy stuff going on. And it seems you‚Äôve loved your time here. However, I‚Äôm curious about whether anyone is able to explore every aspect of IITK, given its heavy academics (which I have often heard about) and the ongoing lockdown?",
      "Older Me:Acads are heavy everywhere, it‚Äôs all about getting that sweet spot of balance where you can enjoy your time with friends, get involved in clubs without compromising acads. As for me, I started exploring different clubs in the online semester itself. In the beginning, I tried to attend every single club meet, eventually leading down to choices more aligned to my interests. I believe it was easier to explore more in online, you could just join another Zoom meet if the current one doesn‚Äôt interest you. I ended up joining a lot of meets, more than I had initially planned!",
      "Me:Was it worth attending so many events and meets, though? How exactly did it contribute to your experience since you wouldn‚Äôt be able to continue everywhere for long?",
      "Older Me:Absolutely. The events that I was a part of gave me the earliest friends in IITK, and also some of the best. Aditya and Shwetank were in the same team as me in a GameDev Club 7-day game-making project. Fast forward to 4th year, we lived in the same wing in Hall 1, with our rooms side by side. I may never have met these awesome people had I decided to skip the meet (I remember having a mild fever around that time). I met Saket and Mihir through Aditya, and we became trip partners. We started with Banaras and Agra (6th semester), and eventually, the legendary Malaysia + Thailand trip. I will tell you more about that later. We cracked a lot of bakchodi goals in Abot, along with Methi, Rishabh, Shishir and others. Some people are bound to cross your path to make the journey better, and that is why you, the smaller me, should always greet them with a smile.",
      "To add to it, I believe that attending those meets, interacting with so many new, different kinds of people opened me up, as a result of which I was able to make friends easily when things started offline.",
      "Me:Oh, so this dark age of online semesters comes to an end!! (My excitement now reached a new height). What was the first offline sem like?",
      "Older Me:Yesss. It‚Äôs the best thing ever, offline experience is so much better. I arrived on campus during Udghosh, and by the time the rest of the batch arrived, Antaragni had started. It was during those days that I met my support system in CSE: Geetika, Tokas and Apoorva. We used to cycle every night around campus and explore different corners, then end up with bulla sessions right on those stairs (he pointed towards the top left corner).",
      "Me:You miss those days a lot, don‚Äôt you?",
      "Older Me:Every day (a sigh). It was in this semester that I met my awesome wingies (Prajwal, Shashank, Havi, Harshit, Prassun among others). We would sleep outside in the summers, exchange GPLs and a whole lot of masti. It is often a matter of luck how good your neighbours are: my luck in terms of my wingies would be equivalent to getting a Royal Flush in poker. I played a lot of Squash that semester (kudos to Utkarsh) and stopped only after getting my shoulder dislocated. Fun fact: On Prassun‚Äôs birthday, I used the full force of my just-recovered shoulder for his GPL and dislocated it again. Though Prassun also ended up with problems in the same area and had to undergo bedrest for 15 days: it was one lethal GPL, indeed!",
      "Me:Umm, not sure if I‚Äôm ready for that (holding my right shoulder). So where did you eventually end up?",
      "Older Me:I was a secy in ELS, PClub, and a team member of Vision (RIP :(). I eventually became a coordinator of ELS, and the experience was really mind blowing. I think I learned most of the life lessons from college in my 3rd year when I was a coordinator. ELS stays close to my heart; it gave me a family and great many gossips. My first offline friend, my first relationship advisor and my co-coordinator, Aviral was there with me during ELS fresher auditions, and also when I bid farewell to the club. My N-word bro Ridin also met me through ELS (though we had too many other PORs in common: Pclub, Vox CGM, and even a common project under a prof). A fun story: One of our first offline coordinator-only meets for ELS started in RM and ended up in Ravemoti watching Oppenheimer, since the main topic brought up was that we need more team bonding, and a good place to start would be coordinator bonding.",
      "See that room over there, that‚Äôs the Litsoc room, our club‚Äôs place. Let me show you the rest of the campus too. I think you should be able to roam around in your dream.",
      "As for Pclub, many of my existing friends also became secys (Tokas, Geetika, Hamza, Sahu, Ridin, DJ). The Pclub bullas were always great and often ended with Deven chasing a dog in Hall 3.",
      "You know, it is these small, random decisions about joining a meet, going for a walk even when tired, approaching someone you barely know, which lead to big endings. The comfort zone is one‚Äôs real enemy and hindrance, and I hope you will learn to get out of it too.",
      "Me:I was misinformed about IITK it seems, it really is a damn fun place. I don‚Äôt believe academics wouldn‚Äôt hinder the fun. It has to be challenging after all.",
      "(We are now walking through the college. Older Talin has shown me different Halls, the swimming pool, e-shop, and a whole lot of other stuff. Is this how a college is supposed to be like? It is a whole f*ing city!)",
      "Older Me:You are correct again. However, acads are tough when dealt with alone, but you bring an entire army of collaborators, and it becomes manageable. My frontline warriors were Geetika, Tokas, Aditya, Apoorva, Paras and others. Here we are what you see in front of you now is the KD building. We were the KD gang, as that was our adda. I proudly claim to have broken every rule possible in RM, and still never have been fined, as my actions were never documented ‚Äî others have been fined, though, especially Geetika. My friends helped and motivated me throughout. Profs at IITK are of all sorts, and it is best to learn as much from them as possible (at least the cool ones). You won‚Äôt get to meet these awesome minds after college that much.",
      "Me:Ha, I knew I‚Äôd make a great team player. I hope we did well in acads. Those are really important after all. You may have realized some tips and tricks during these years, if I‚Äôm correct?",
      "Older Me:Yeah, don‚Äôt worry about that. It was pretty good. You currently seem to give a lot of weight to it, but you‚Äôll soon realize that there‚Äôs a bigger picture: there is so much else to campus life. Something that helped me was realizing that attending classes made it a lot easier during exams, even though I would sleep through half of them. After some semesters, you also get an idea about what the exam may be like, based on what topics the prof focuses on and is passionate about during class. But again, attending classes has always been a pain, and my phone and ability to sleep anywhere, anytime helped me through. Our seniors are pretty helpful too, so it makes it a lot easier.",
      "Hmm, why do you look so stressed? Worried about something?",
      "Me:Ah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure about the senior-junior culture. From what I‚Äôve seen in movies, it seems pretty rough.",
      "Older Me:Ha! (laughing) They over-dramatize everything. You can get a sense of how close the interactions are from the Amma-Baapu system. I still remember getting the first call from Jasjot and calling him Baapu in that call itself. ‚ÄúJasjot ko call kar, Jasjot ko call kar,‚Äù was what Shashank was telling everyone while panicking, in the aftermath of that fatal GPL. I met different seniors through different sources; all of them had a diverse set of gyaan to share, and I tried to incorporate as much as possible in my life. I think my campus journey would have been a lot different (and less adventurous) if I had not met KPS, Prem, Ayush, Rose, Piyush, Naman, and many more amazing seniors. Everyone here has a different story to tell, different experiences, different tips and tricks to handle situations, and ofc, some legendary stories to tell. I hope you, too, get to know about these, wherever you decide to go.",
      "Ofc, there‚Äôs another side to that coin. I am currently a Par-dada and have had an amazing time with my juniors. My bachas have always been hard party animals, and I‚Äôm proud that they hardly ever hesitated to share any problems. I also share a special bond with my juniors from ELS, whether it‚Äôs going to RDV and roaming Delhi, or going to IITKGP for Inter IIT Cult Meet.",
      "Me:These sound like some really interesting competitions. You know I‚Äôve always wanted to represent my institution: school, college, whatever.",
      "Older Me:Yes, and they are worth every effort. Inter IIT Tech Meet ‚Äô23 was maybe the most intense period of my college. Me, Teju, Tokas, and Aadvik would stock up with Sting, and each of us drank at least five each night. Tokas and I had a CS220 lab during those days and were partners in it. That‚Äôs when the legend of the ‚ÄòHeart‚Äô Module began. During Wednesday‚Äôs lab, with each code Sir saw after ours, he was repeatedly reminded of his youth by the ‚ÄòHeart‚Äô module present in every code.",
      "For Cult Meet ‚Äô23 and ‚Äô24, I participated in multiple events, as a secy and as a coordie respectively. I could feel how the entire council became one, leaving aside our differences as separate clubs (I won‚Äôt name our arch nemesis, iykyk). The lessons I learned through these will stay with me forever. After all, the journey is often worth more than the effort.",
      "You know, the craze for these competitions is further increased through the GC. I‚Äôm really happy that the Nawabs won the GC more than once during my three years here, and I was part of it every time.",
      "(We are now in front of a tall, red building that seemed more modern than others. I just saw some sort of medical school a couple of buildings behind. I now understand why Sarthak, my coaching senior, sounded so excited whenever he talked about going to campus.)",
      "Older Me:The good thing about IITK is, you will never get bored of anything. There are so many recreation options. I used to play cards with my wingies, especially in the final year. A major highlight of my campus life will be the rooftops: DJAC, design building, Technopark 1 & 2, ESB, Admin building, Chemical building, and many more. What you see in front of you right now is the Technopark building, the first whose rooftop I was on. My partners in crime were often Geetika, Atulya, and Snehal. We were often caught by sis guards on inaccessible roofs; I even asked one to take a selfie with us (he refused, ofc). Being on the rooftops gives you a different perspective of the campus, telling you how much there is still to explore as you discover different corners of the campus. And ofc, doing ‚Äòchicken banana‚Äô is a good way to make things funny, and Aayush, Tejas, and Ridin will concur.",
      "Another wonderful thing I liked about IITK is its excellent sports facilities. I had given up on sports after dislocating my shoulder in the squash court in 2nd semester, as a precautionary measure. However, when I got it dislocated again in Malaysia, I realized that no matter how many precautions I took, it ain‚Äôt getting healed. Hence, I went all out and spent a lot of time playing badminton and squash in the final semester. It took a lot of courage at first, but I refused to just sit around in fear and compromise on doing what I loved. It was a risk I was now ready to take, after all, in the worst case, it would just be a couple of hours of intense pain and a week of wearing a sling, then I could be back on court after that.",
      "Me:Great! You must be missing it all quite a bit, I understand. To be honest, I‚Äôm noticing a lot of things about you that are unlike me. Maybe you have grown a lot over these years. This place, by just walking through it, I can feel the energy, the vibes, and the memories here. Goodbyes have always been tough for me, and I‚Äôm happy that I still retain that characteristic. You were going to tell me more about your trip to, umm, Bali?",
      "Older Me:Yeah, the one to Thailand and Malaysia actually, with Adi, Socket, and Shwetank. It was a fun, long trip, and we carried our pool wrestling moves thousands of miles away to the infinity pool of Kuala Lumpur. We also stepped on the tiger‚Äôs tail, well, to be more precise, we used the tail as a moustache. Clubs in Bangkok were the best. I know your dream of seeing the world, well, we‚Äôre definitely making progress. You‚Äôll be happy to know that we visit Singapore and the UK as part of our summer internships and make long-lasting friendships there too.",
      "Me:Oh, oh, tell me all about internships and placements.",
      "Older Me:I won‚Äôt reveal much; something has to be a surprise for you after all, though I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll remember very little from this dream. But rest assured: we end up well. Though there was a bit of a dark phase when I was expecting PPO from TRC and didn‚Äôt get it. I would thank all my friends for standing alongside me and motivating me through that phase, especially the COWS, Geetika, Tokas and Aayush. I think this is a good place to see you off for the night.",
      "(We had now reached the airstrip. We walked inside and stood on one of the ‚ÄòH‚Äô.)",
      "Me:Why this place in particular?",
      "Older Me:It was this place, where three years ago, the spark of love for IITK‚Äôs culture ignited within me. The story of HR Kadim, whether real or not, switched something inside me that still runs ablaze. I realized back then that it was up to me to make the coming years wonderful, to live life to the fullest, and to carry the culture forward. This place gave that sort of positive vibes. I now carry the pride of being an IITK alumnus and cherish all my memories here. There are regrets, of course. But there need to be regrets in every story; that‚Äôs what makes us human. One thing I will never regret is choosing IITK, and with that, bro, I will say goodbye to you. I hope you now have some clarity about what to do. Also, you are pretty lucky I came for you, had it not been for Lavanya and the Vox Team, I would have completely forgotten about it .",
      "‚Ä¶",
      "He vanished into thin air. I looked around, then up at the sky. I felt a unique tranquility there. I closed my eyes and was ready to go back.",
      "‚ÄúChal, bhar le preference ab,‚Äù mumma says as I take my laptop in hand. I feel something different this morning, like I had been somewhere last night, someplace wonderful, someplace that felt like home. This is a strange feeling; it must have been some weird dream. However, I keep getting this urge to put IITK at the top, not sure why. All the confusion seems to have faded. ‚ÄúI am going to IITK. There are some awesome people waiting for me there, people I am destined to meet, to call my friends, and to make memories with.‚Äù I still don‚Äôt understand why or how I said these things, but I am feeling satisfied.",

      "In this 16th edition of As We Leave, Akshay Choudhary, a Y21 student graduating from the Department of Electrical Engineering, reflects on a journey that began in the quiet isolation of online classes and slowly unfolded into a vibrant, purpose-driven life on campus. From eSports to Prayas, he navigated IITK with steady steps‚Äîbuilding meaning in the everyday and strength through consistency. What began as a digital blur became a deeply human experience, stitched together by connection, service, and sincere gratitude.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "I was told to write AWL, so I started looking at my gallery to remember the memories stored in 30k photos of less than 4 years.Being a part of the Y21 BTech Electrical Engineering batch at IIT Kanpur has been nothing short of transformative. From day one, the campus became more than just a place to study‚Äîit became home.",
      "When I joined IITK, I came in with the ambition to explore every domain ‚Äì academics, extracurriculars, and everything in between. But reality hit quickly: getting a decent CPI was not optional but essential. The journey began during a pandemic, with classes held online.",
      "Online classes didn‚Äôt feel real. It made exams feel like landmines, and yet, a strange casualness crept in. I couldn‚Äôt get myself to focus. Lectures blurred into each other. Motivation came in waves and disappeared just as quickly. I wastechnically‚Äòin IIT Kanpur‚Äô, but mentally,I was just a confused Wi-Fi signal floating somewhere in cyberspace.",
      "MTH101 was a nightmare‚Äîproof problems we‚Äôd never seen before, and no idea how the prof taught. But turns out, while I couldn‚Äôt follow him in class, I couldn‚Äôt follow his smashes on the court either ‚Äì played badminton with him in my last sem and got absolutely wrecked.Did everything from online dance classes to online campaigning for elections.Despite the distance, I found joy in the chaos: Bulla sessions that stretched late into the night, heartfelt family meets, department orientations, club meetings, and the thrill of joining college fest teams. Behind all of these, though, was a daily struggle‚Äîdealing with quizzes that wouldn‚Äôt load, and somehow managing to submit assignments at 11:59 PM with 2% battery and 0% clue.",
      "After doing random experiments on Phyphox by hanging our phones and then finally stepping onto campus and seeing real faces instead of pixelated boxes on Zoom.In April 2022, the Y21 batch arrived on campus. After months of online guessing, I was finally here. The sun felt different.",
      "But with offline life in full swing, time management hit like a truck. Between spontaneous hangouts, overdue assignments, and getting lost between OAT and LHC.",
      "We got free Wi-Fi too, but were immediately told: ‚ÄúUse it for kaam, not Kamasutra.‚Äù Welcome to IIT Kanpur.",
      "We explored the campus like tourists. Explored it so much that we kind of forgot to study. Volleyball, badminton, TT, cycling day and night, nonstop. Somehow, we still passed the semester. We picked up IITK lingo on the go, playedwaytoo much BGMI, and discovered the joy of late-night chai and unnecessary deep conversations. The treasure hunt was great fun in itself.",
      "Orientation started, and seniors would storm in every morning, waking us up with classic lines like ‚ÄúGap cover karo!‚Äù as we stood half-asleep in messy lines. Hall 13 was home for a while, pure madness and fun, until 3rd sem hit, and we were all scattered to different halls",
      "Of course, exploring campus wasn‚Äôt complete without discovering Student Search. With wingies beside me and questionable curiosity in our hearts, we dove in.",
      "I got involved in eSports, joined the Finance Club, and somehow ended up becoming an SG. I still don‚Äôt know the criteria. One of my friends still does the occasionalrrjust because he didn‚Äôt make it. But if I‚Äôm being honest, the SG/AM scene has its fair share of problems. Many SGs I met couldn‚Äôt explain academics to save their own lives, and a surprising number have never even seen theirbachhas.Somewhere along the way, I also witnessed the madness of impeachments. IITK politics? Stay as far away as you can.",
      "Then came my first bappu party, which was a blast! I also had the opportunity to work in Udghosh, which was an experience in itself. Among all of this, I started volunteering with Prayas, teaching 11th-grade math.",
      "Then came the first winter on campus, it was freezing ‚Äì but unforgettable. I still remember basking in the sun outside L19 and L20, books in hand, trying to make sense of both academics and life. Around the same time, I started working as a student marketer with Red Bull. The work was light, the fun was plenty, and the cans? Endless.",
      "I became the leader of the Esports Society, and it turned out to be one of the most fulfilling chapters of my journey. Late-night scrims, strategy calls, and the adrenaline rush of tournaments forged bonds rooted in shared passion. Organizing events, working with an incredibly dedicated and lovely team, and even jumping into the tournaments myself ‚Äì it was all pure joy.",
      "What began as a volunteering stint soon evolved into something far deeper ‚Äì a source of purpose, grounding, and joy. While I initially dabbled in multiple clubs, I eventually chose to focus solely on Prayas. And that decision changed everything. From the moment we stepped into the classroom, we were greeted with bright smiles and a chorus of ‚ÄúNamaste Bhaiya,‚Äù spoken with such sincerity and warmth that it would instantly lift my spirits. That simple greeting, filled with respect and love, reminded me every single day why this work mattered.",
      "As a Manager at Prayas, I took on the responsibility of ensuring our classes ran smoothly. We conducted not just academic sessions but also a variety of extracurricular and awareness programs, ranging from Fine Arts classes to Sexual Awareness workshops. These initiatives weren‚Äôt just about education, they were about giving these kids opportunities to dream bigger and experience more.",
      "Some of my fondest memories are from celebrating festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Raksha Bandhan with the children. We visited the students‚Äô homes to distribute sweets and celebrate with their families.Beyond the classroom, we worked to address the kids‚Äô needs holistically.Home visits gave me a deeper perspective on their challenges and made the bond even more personal. I still remember how the children would plead,‚ÄúBhaiya, aaj mere ghar chaliye khana khane,‚Äùand sometimes even argue among themselves about whose home I‚Äôd visit next. Their innocence, affection, and excitement were truly humbling. I still vividly remember the day before my end-semester exam, when the students I used to teach did a vc, warmly asked, ‚ÄòAap kaise ho, Bhaiya?‚Äô",
      "No matter how many years pass, Prayas will always hold a special place in my heart. The tiny excuses kids made to talk to us, their mischief, their wide-eyed questions, all of it stays with me. Prayas wasn‚Äôt just about teaching. It was about learning ‚Äì learning to lead with empathy, to serve with love, and to believe in the quiet power of community.",
      "The summer after my second year was far from a break. It wasn‚Äôt just about handling responsibilities. While internship preparation kicked off in full swing, I found myself juggling multiple commitments: managingPrayas, coordinating activities for theEsports Society, and completing a summer course I had enrolled in. It was a packed schedule, but I genuinely enjoyed every bit of it. I still remember those frantic days, sitting in the library, Hall 2 reading room doing DSA.",
      "I gave 6-7 interviews during the internship season and faced rejections. It was disheartening, to say the least. Eventually, in the second phase of campus internships, I finally received an offer.",
      "Around the same time, the campus went through something far heavier. In my sixth semester, we witnessed protests and dharnas following student suicides. The atmosphere turned somber, reflective, and charged with emotion. For the first time, I truly saw the power and the responsibility of the student body.",
      "Summer break had started. This time, it felt real. I knew it was time to buckle down‚Äîupdate my r√©sum√©, practice deck-making, revisit DSA, and finally dive into machine learning. I cut out the distractions: swapped Instagram for LinkedIn, traded leisure for late-night prep sessions‚Äîit almost felt like getting back into JEE mode.",
      "In mid-June, I received a call from an alumnus working at a startup who offered me a role. I accepted immediately. Since my campus internship was remote and relatively light on workload, I managed to juggle both the startup experience and placement prep. It was intense, but in the best way‚Äîproductive, focused, and driven by purpose.",
      "August came quickly. With our internships behind us, everyone returned to campus‚Äîexcited, anxious, and slightly more grown-up. The pressure was on. Placements were around the corner, and all of us were quietly hoping we‚Äôd done enough.",
      "This semester started off differently‚Äîno academic pressure, but plenty of DSA practice. I spent many hours tucked away in a quiet corner of the library, grinding through problems to prepare for placements. If you look closely, you might still find some handwriting left behind on the ground floor tables‚Äîa small reminder of those long study sessions.",
      "I missed my lastAntaragnibecause I had to travel to Mumbai for a Red Bull conference, which was an incredible experience in itself.",
      "Before I knew it, mid and end semesters flew by, and placements arrived.",
      "Five busy days, twenty-one interviews, and then I got placed on Day 6. It felt strange and surreal, and I‚Äôm still processing how it all unfolded. But that time taught me lessons beyond academics, and I‚Äôm grateful for the experience.",
      "Then began the final and most memorable semester ‚Äì a whirlwind of variety, unexpected moments, and unforgettable experiences.",
      "Academics? Hardly anyone paid attention, after all, it was the last semester.",
      "I traveled to Goa with wingies, they were there for every chai break rant, every pre-exam panic, every rooftop talk, and every shared silence that didn‚Äôt need words. They‚Äôve seen me at my best and my worst and stood by me through it all.",
      "Spent entire days playing cards, and tried a variety of new stuff. The photoshoots captured some of the best memories of this time.",
      "Amidst this, campus buzzed with events ‚Äì Scribble Day, Dance Extravaganza, Graduation Dinner, batch photoshoot, etc. I still remember shooting video with ‚ÄúALs‚Äù, suited up and wearing shades, dancing at 7 a.m. in the middle of nowhere. These moments weren‚Äôt just fun, they were our way of being together, one last time.",
      "There were also Indo parties, bachha parties, club nights, farewells, each event adding its own flavor to the final chapter.",
      "Slowly, people started to leave, and the reality sank in: some of the most cherished faces would never be seen again. And just like that, college life came to its close.",
      "I won‚Äôt be mentioning any names ‚Äì because all of you, in your own beautiful way, have left a mark on my life. And if you‚Äôre reading this, know that you impacted my college life in a good way.",
      "One of the biggest lessons I‚Äôm taking from IITK is to have a big heart. Learn to take rejections, handle the ups and downs. Someone will always have more than you¬† ‚Äì marks, PPOs, CV points, achievements‚Äîbut instead of letting that break you, let itmotivateyou.",
      "The ending won‚Äôt always be perfect. It won‚Äôt always be what you dreamed. But it‚Äôs stillyourending. And that‚Äôs reason enough to keep moving forward.",
      "This AWL isn‚Äôt meant to inspire you. I just hope that if someone somewhere is living through the same experiences I did, they‚Äôll feel a little less alone reading this.",
      "No need to learn much from it, merely read it as I wrote.This isn‚Äôt a goodbye to one person; it‚Äôs a thank you to everyone.",

      "In this 15th edition of As We Leave, Medha, a Y21 student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, walks us through her time at IIT Kanpur‚Äîa journey marked by unexpected lessons, quiet realizations, and the people who made it all worthwhile. From navigating a tough second year filled with labs and resume checklists to finding clarity through Surge and finally discovering her own pace during placements, Medha‚Äôs story captures the many shades of student life. Through it all, what truly stood out was the role of friendship‚Äîthose constant, grounding presences that picked her up on the hardest days and celebrated the smallest wins. Her time here wasn‚Äôt perfect‚Äîbut it was real, and in the end, it was enough.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "As we leave.. I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs now time to leave. For just days before, I was reading my senior‚Äôs awl, and now I‚Äôm writing my own. Fleeting memories flash by so fast ‚Ä¶ So fresh that I could pick any of them from my library and relive it but yet so far away. I have come so far. I think I have experienced what they call growing up. I came in as an introvert girl wanting to create an extrovert college life, laaaarge group of friends, and fantasizing about every other Bollywood college life movie. I had made up my mind that enjoyment, not studies, would be my priority. Little did I know what life holds for me.",
      "The first semester began with the usual chaos ‚Äî the formation of countless groups, endless bulla sessions, and making a bunch of new friends, some of whom would become my closest circle. I had officially stepped into a whole new phase of life, and I was loving every bit of it.",
      "By April, the long wait was over ‚Äî we were finally called to campus. The excitement was unreal. I was actually going to live with my friends! I had never experienced hostel life before, and I was looking forward to it with all my heart.",
      "But amidst all that excitement, there was a lingering worry. I wasn‚Äôt sure how people would react to meeting me offline. Ever since childhood, I have been quite conscious of my body and appearance. I had gone through a health condition during my early teens, and the treatment led to significant weight gain. I became the chubby ‚Äúcute‚Äù kid whose cheeks everyone loved to pull. But now, it was college ‚Äî and let‚Äôs be honest, especially in those initial days, looks do matter, more so for girls.",
      "So, with a heart full of anticipation and a little bit of self-doubt, I set off for Kanpur.",
      "What I discovered, though, was something truly unexpected. People here were genuinely kind. No one cared about how you looked or what you wore. The freedom that IIT Kanpur offers is a sanctuary ‚Äî you feel completely unrestrained, yet deeply safe. It was in that environment that my love for the campus truly began.",
      "Every night after dinner, we‚Äôd hop on cycles and explore different corners of the campus. We‚Äôd stumble upon new spots, admire the beauty of IITK, and when we were too tired to pedal anymore, we‚Äôd land up at OAT. We‚Äôd grab some food, sneak it past the dogs, climb the OAT stairs, find a comfy corner to sit, and spend the rest of the night talking, laughing, clicking pictures, and listening to music.",
      "Even when I got sleepy, I wouldn‚Äôt go back to my room. Somehow, those warm, slightly rough stairs ‚Äî softened by the gentle April breeze ‚Äî felt more comforting than my mattress. We‚Äôd stay up to watch the sunrise, head straight to breakfast, and only then go to bed.Those days were nothing short of magical.",
      "As I stepped into the second year‚Äîthe most challenging year of Mechanical Engineering‚Äîwith heavyweight courses likeESO209, it felt like a sudden jolt. After a relatively relaxed and light first year, we were hit hard with the academic rigor of the second year. With 3‚Äì4 labs, weekly quizzes, and a string of trailing zeroes, the pressure was intense. Mechanical Engineering wasn‚Äôt pulling any punches.",
      "To make things harder, I had also involved myself in several clubs and councils. Instead of being a refreshing break, they turned into an additional workload. I was a part of theRobotics Club, the AnC Council, and the Stamatics Club‚Äînot out of passion, but because I believed I needed as many PoRs as possible to make my resume stand out. I had been told that these would play a big role in getting interview shortlists. Looking back now, I realize how misguided that approach was.",
      "My entire second year was consumed by this chase. I neither worked on improving my skills nor focused on my CPI. All I did was collect things to ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù my resume‚Äîprojects, certificates, and PoRs. Meanwhile, many of my peers had started practicing DSA. At the time, I considered that a waste of time, thinking their resumes would be too empty to get noticed. How wrong I was.",
      "When the summer break came, I was convinced I needed some work experience on my resume, so I decided to pursue a SURGE project. Although my reasoning wasn‚Äôt solid, SURGE turned out to be a blessing. It gave me two things:",
      "Still, for the rest of my time, I continued the same old pattern‚Äîfocusing on collecting resume points rather than building any solid base.",
      "Then came the intern season, and reality hit me like a truck. It was harsh, surprising, and disheartening. I didn‚Äôt receive a single shortlist on Day 1. The reasons were clear:",
      "I lacked both resources and knowledge. I cried, cursed the system, and blamed everything on luck to cope with the situation. Even when I did get a few shortlists in the later days, I couldn‚Äôt get past the first round of interviews‚Äîbecause I simply wasn‚Äôt prepared.",
      "The only interviews where I performed decently were with core companies, thanks to the actual experience I gained during SURGE. Eventually, in October, I got an internship at JSW, and although that brought me some relief from the constant trauma of rejections, I couldn‚Äôt rest easy. I knew I had wasted too much time pretending to be someone I wasn‚Äôt‚Äîchasing achievements that didn‚Äôt truly matter.",
      "For anyone reading this, here are a few lessons I‚Äôve learned the hard way:",
      "I was now determined ‚Äî truly determined ‚Äî to push my CPI above 8. No more wishful thinking, no more excuses. I committed myself wholeheartedly: consistent effort, relentless discipline, and slowly but surely, I began to see a shift. I started scoring well, more often than not. But of course, not everything went as planned. There were moments of faltering ‚Äî unexpected lows, disappointing results ‚Äî and they felt unfair, like betrayal after all the effort. I was disheartened.",
      "But I was never alone.",
      "Each time I broke down, my friends picked me up. They reminded me that no one achieves great things effortlessly. That effort, not ease, defines success. And they were right. By the end of my sixth semester, I had done it ‚Äî my CPI was finally above 8.",
      "The grades came in while I was standing in a shopping mall. My heart raced as if I were about to receive a final verdict. I nervously opened the email, sneaking a look at one grade at a time. With each course, my spirits climbed higher, until I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore ‚Äî I screamed, jumped, and yes, embarrassed myself publicly. But I didn‚Äôt care. For the first time in college, I felt proud of myself. That moment ‚Äî it felt like triumph. Like redemption.",
      "Then came the internship phase.",
      "I‚Äôd always believed that my internship experience wouldn‚Äôt be as enriching as those who‚Äôd landed offers at their ‚Äúdream companies.‚Äù I carried this stereotype about JSW ‚Äî that I wouldn‚Äôt learn much or grow meaningfully. But I was wrong. I had chosen my projects carefully, aligning them perfectly with my passion for machine learning.",
      "And that changed everything.",
      "Because of my past projects and coursework, I found myself ahead of the curve. While others were just starting out, I was already building. I made an impression ‚Äî not because I was trying to, but because I had quietly prepared for this moment all along. I ended up receiving the Best Project Award.",
      "It struck me then: ML didn‚Äôt help me get the intern, but it made the internship mine.",
      "And that‚Äôs when I realized ‚Äî the company you go to doesn‚Äôt matter as much as what you do once you‚Äôre there. I had once envied others for their glamorous offers, but now, I wouldn‚Äôt trade my experience for anything. Destiny has its own timing. Eventually, you see how every piece fits ‚Äî how it was all justified, all deserved.",
      "Then came August. The placement season.",
      "A time of relentless grind. A test of patience, resilience, and will. I knew what was coming, and I braced myself. This was another chance ‚Äî maybe my last ‚Äî to prove myself. This time, I couldn‚Äôt afford to falter. I poured everything into preparation. Between classes, during classes, in the early morning hours ‚Äî every spare moment went into prep. I made a calendar, broke down daily goals, and didn‚Äôt sleep until I ticked every box.",
      "It was grueling.",
      "But still, I kept going. I‚Äôd already decided I would face the worst, and I wouldn‚Äôt look away. I stopped expecting anything. I focused on giving my best, trusting that whatever I received would be right for me.",
      "And then came November ‚Äî a storm.",
      "Quizzes. Company tests. End-sems. PPTs. All crashing down at once. Nights blurred into test after test, mornings into lectures, afternoons into more evaluations. There was no time left to even breathe, let alone prepare. My targets drifted. My results disappointed. Shortlists came and passed without my name. I felt invisible. Rejected. I cried ‚Äî not once, but for hours on end ‚Äî out of frustration, fear, exhaustion.",
      "It was unbearable.",
      "But once again ‚Äî my friends were there. Reminding me that I wasn‚Äôt alone. That Ihadprepared. That things would change.. Without them, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through. Slowly, things turned. I began to see shortlists. I started managing my schedule again. Hope returned, fragile but real.",
      "Then came the D-Day.",
      "I still remember it like it was yesterday. Imagine this: in twelve hours, it would all be over. Either victory or another heartbreak. I had studied hard. I was scared, but not paralyzed. I knew this time was different ‚Äî I hadprepared. Maybe I would stumble, maybe not ace it all, but I would not blank out. I was ready.",
      "First came ITC. I had cleared five rounds and was told the last would be informal. I comforted myself ‚Äî even if everything else failed, at least I had this. But then came my Microsoft interview. It had gone well, and my hopes were high ‚Äî perhaps too high. Within hours, I received the news.",
      "ITC had rejected me.",
      "Microsoft too.",
      "It felt like my world collapsed.",
      "I was numb. I felt like I was reliving the internship pain all over again. I cried. I broke down. I cursed myself for not doing more, not being enough.. My confidence turned to ash. I felt like a failure. I just wanted to go home. Still, I dragged myself through the last few interviews. One was Finmechanics ‚Äî where I thought I‚Äôd surely been rejected after a shaky first round. But surprisingly, I was called for the second. It was 4 AM by then. The atmosphere aroundwas chaotic ‚Äî some crying, some celebrating, most just stunned. I gave my final round. It went well. Strangely well.",
      "But I was done. Empty.",
      "I didn‚Äôt even think about Day 1.2. I just crashed. I didn‚Äôt call my parents. I didn‚Äôt think. I slept. And then ‚Äî at 8 AM ‚Äî a call.",
      "I had been selected.",
      "Finmechanics had made me an offer.",
      "I cried. This time out of joy. Shock. Relief. Gratitude. I had always visualized getting placed on Day 1.1. And it had come true. Every single failure suddenly felt small, every heartbreak perfectly timed.",
      "I had finally succeeded.",
      "That moment ‚Äî that fleeting, beautiful moment ‚Äî is forever etched in my heart. It gives me goosebumps even now. Because yes, hard workdoespay off. Maybe not instantly, but always eventually. And the people around you ‚Äî the ones who cheer you on, cry with you, stay up late with you, believe in you even when you‚Äôve stopped believing in yourself ‚Äî they are everything.",
      "Lavesh, Deeksha, Dwija, Princy, Tavishi, Ashish, Shubham, Ishan ‚Äî thank you. For your love. Your support. Your truth. You helped me become who I am.",
      "And to anyone reading this: Rest assured, if you have been true to yourself and sincere in your efforts, you will be justly rewarded. The reward may not be exactly what you hoped for or worked towards, but it will be what is best for you ‚Äî something that will benefit you the most in the long run. Do not worry or dwell on the outcome. Embrace it wholeheartedly and strive to make the most of it. Success is not always linear. It‚Äôs chaotic, painful, unpredictable. Many times, you will feel hopeless, stuck, and cheated, but if you hold on¬†and keep showing up,you‚Äôll get there.",
      "As I write this, having just left campus, a whole whirlwind of emotions rushes through me. I‚Äôm in tears. I miss the campus ‚Äî its people, its pace, its way of life.",
      "The last semester was the most eventful one, and perhaps the most beautiful too. Somewhere in the middle of it all, it suddenly hits you ‚Äî this is the end. The place that once felt so permanent is slowly slipping away. And then, instinctively, you start capturing everything. Every moment. Every face. Every corner.",
      "I did so many of myfirstsin the last semester ‚Äî went on trips, lived each day to the fullest, and studied the least. Life suddenly became so happening, so full, that I didn‚Äôt even get the time to pause and feel that it was all ending.",
      "Batch photoshoots, Dance Extravaganza, farewell, jamming sessions, testimonials ‚Äî everything came flooding in, one after another. And I made a conscious choice: not to feel sad just yet, but to soak it all in. To relive my favourite memories, visit my favourite places, and create new ones.",
      "It felt easier to pretend it wasn‚Äôt ending. To pretend we‚Äôd still bump into each other in corridors. That we‚Äôd still barge into rooms unannounced, rant endlessly, laugh uncontrollably, and share even the silliest thoughts like it was the most important thing in the world.",
      "But deep down, we knew.",
      "We knew that we wouldn‚Äôt be waking up at 7:55 for an 8 AM class anymore, or skipping breakfast just for ten extra minutes of sleep. We‚Äôll no more be having shared wardrobes( ahh the joy of perfectly fitting into each others‚Äô clothes), No more get ready together sessions for fests, No more late-night tea breaks at DOAA canteen. No more casual all-nighters at the library just because you were ‚Äúkind of‚Äù studying with friends.",
      "IIT Kanpur ishome.",
      "The most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever known. Every corner, every road ‚Äî it holds a memory. A story. My story. This campus has a kind of comfort that‚Äôs hard to describe ‚Äî a deep, quiet acceptance. It takes you in just the way you are, and slowly, gently, makes you its own.",
      "This final semester was a rollercoaster. From feeling like I wouldn‚Äôt perform in DE, to ending up giving one of my best performances. From waking up at 6 AM for photoshoots and hunting for bougainvillea-filled spots, to exploring untouched buildings and revisiting old ones ‚Äî just like I did in my first semester.",
      "And then there‚Äôs the OAT. The OAT is a vibe in itself. Calm yet buzzing with life. With the most surreal sky view, it became a favourite spot for late-night reflections and conversations that never needed to end.",
      "Leaving this place is painful. But more than that ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad it happened. Grateful, beyond words.",
      "IIT Kanpur gave me everything I could‚Äôve ever asked for ‚Äî a great beginning to my career, life lessons I‚Äôll carry forever, the confidence to embrace myself, and the kind of friendships that feel like family.",
      "To my people ‚Äî I will continue to love and cherish you always. To this place ‚Äî I will miss every bit of you. To everyone still on campus ‚Äî soak it all in. These days, this freedom, this space to grow ‚Äî it won‚Äôt come again in quite the same way. Don‚Äôt hold back. Explore every corner of who you are and who you could become. Don‚Äôt let fear or doubt put fences around your choices. You are made of infinite possibilities. Dream boldly, fail bravely, and rise stronger. This is your time ‚Äî live it fully, deeply, unapologetically.",
      "Thank you, IITK. You were everything.You are everything.",

      "In this 14th edition of As We Leave, Utkarsh Agrawal, a Y21 student graduating from the Department of Mathematics, reflects on a journey shaped by gradual transformations, fleeting moments, and the shifting nightscape outside the window. What began in stillness unfolded into memories, friendships, and a farewell that lingers gently‚Äîmuch like the quiet scenery he leaves behind.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Writing this on my ride back home, lying on the bus seat, a cold breeze rushing in and the full moon over the window sill; all of it making the ride nostalgic in itself.The moon, shifting in and out of sight, seemed trying to personify my college journey; and mirror the thoughts of leaving in stages ‚Äì nostalgic, clouded, dim, and glowing.",
      "I was quite okay at the thought of leaving the campus. Like every other phase of life, here too, there would be people withdrawing; you aren‚Äôt happy with it but that‚Äôs life. Made me wonder, what would be different this time?That‚Äôs when I turned towards writing this piece which has slowly turned to be more emotional and reflective, than I anticipated. The weight of ‚Äúmilte hai soon‚Ä¶‚Äù texts kept growing heavier with the realizations of never returning to the college phase, ever.",
      "",
      "I was never into talking much, and with due fairness my social skills, in particular, are something that have evolved deeply over the years. I initially tried, but in the online sem lagged behind for a lack of acquaintance with contemporary social trends. I could get a good start in the offline phase because of my fondness for interacting with strangers but I continued to struggle to form meaningful bonds with people.",
      "A due credit goes to my wing, and the people I found thereafter, who took in extra efforts to give me company. I got to talking with people and learning to turn acquaintances into friends. My short stint at HH, where I quickly realized my lack of talent for comedy, got me to talk out myself, without the need for overthinking. The late night bullas, participation in multiple clubs, random political arguments, wing pranks unsuitable for public acceptance, which finally got me the social butterfly in farewell (though credit to MTH fam‚Äôs hooting too!). Nonetheless, I am still to get comfortable sharing my personal life, something left for future UTkarsh to take care of!",
      "Accompanying me on the ride, the moon had changed its elegance, peeking in and out of the hammered clouds. Another notification pops, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a weird feeling to see your room open nd not finding you in it, miss u :/‚Äù. On the already quiet night, the eyes welled up, not so rare on campus but rare for campus.",
      "One of my memorable experiences in college was participating in TechMeet. Something that pushed me over & gave some best friends for life. Quite a trenching time putting in effort, but all was worth doing with such a great team. It was a perfect roller coaster experience, with sitting clueless a week before midterm submission, to being super excited with our idea, to questioning our life choices on a possible shift in the set of seniors. I remember breaking down, back in hall when a senior dismissed our idea two days before the presentation. But in the end, the stint was golden!!",
      "My journey with Vox was a distinctly wonderful one. Joined in for the idea of journalism, stayed in for the amazing people and culture, and ended my stint with it for something I liked most about it. It was a place to be a great junior, approachable senior and fun team member and is a part of my core campus memories. The article meets at CCDs, continuous texting on messenger and endless contemplations over petty sentences are gonna stay forever. It gave me many great friends and a thing I kept getting identified by throughout my college life.¬† Though it was harsh seeing it lose sight of what it stood for (atleast for me), many lessons were learned and a place in heart reserved for it and its juniors always.",
      "Beyond these core journeys, the campus offered innumerous unexpected experiences. I played squash, enjoyed humanities more than my core courses, role played the PM twice despite regularly bashing him in the wing, and once argued solo at length against eight over a Takneek penalty we didn‚Äôt deserve. But if I had to pick my most dramatic one ‚Äì it‚Äôd be this train story.",
      "So a group of friends (including two well known Y19s) left campus at 8:00 in night for a train that departed at 8:40. At 8:30, I started getting calls, ‚ÄúPull the chain! We‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù. So after repeated calls, panic, and a promise to pay the fine later; I pulled the chain! Great, yes. Except‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt even close. What followed was chaos: judgy eyes, arguments with staff, police interventions, and finally, the train started moving again. And here comes the climax: four kids sprinting across the platform, chased by their auto-aunty yelling for payment (because none had cash), all chasing a moving train. Finally someone pulled the chain again, and they made it. I never got the promised treat, but surely a story for life.",
      "This ride‚Äôs scenery had unfolded another mood. The moon has disappeared again, this time behind these rising mountain breaks. Barren and dusty with some thorny risers resting the terrain. Lit and glow, yet dark and loomy.",
      "Entering the premises an immature, I had just like any average kid, a hunch to be popular. Somehow, this reciprocated into an idea of wanting to be liked by everyone. I would take extra steps even if it meant doing things I don‚Äôt like. It took a long while to realize that this in turn just drained me emotionally. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to not like some and not be liked by everyone. It‚Äôs fine to say no, argue or not be able to care for some. What matters is to have some whom we can deeply care for!",
      "The more I think about it, the simpler my college life feels. For me the campus acted like a¬† mirror ‚Äì reflecting what I threw at it. When I locked myself in my room, it quietly held the silence with me. And when I let myself loosen up, the campus opened up too, with noise, chaos and fun.IITK, at its core, gave the freedom to choose. To take a class or miss it, get an opportunity or just lie low. But choice is tricky. Sometimes it works. Often, it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs hard to know whether the decisions we make will age well. And maybe that‚Äôs what makes life hard to pin down. Especially for someone like me, who likes to plan down things to the minute.",
      "My branch here was MTH, though I still have contacts saved as MnC. Mathematics was never my strong suit, though I didn‚Äôt dislike it. The subject offered a number of eureka moments. Just the problem is the courses in literally every semester featuring a pursuit to evade degree extension. But with friends so wonderful, I survived. Notes and papers from over the four years left behind in haste or consciously?",
      "This moon is back high and the scenery has elevated again. It‚Äôs like a painted frame on the wall, with the essence of life somewhere far deep.",
      "The final year was a complete contrast to my earlier three years. I was a part of multiple clubs in my earlier years, with days on end when I would return room only to sleep. But suddenly with my final year, I had nothing to do. Initially, this did not reciprocate well; with me staying in my room most of the time, getting bored and sad. I was in a new wing, compounded with a low social energy to make new friends. With time, I painted, decorated my room, attended random gymkhana events only to slowly discover people who were gonna be part of my best campus memories.",
      "Post the placement season,the last sem passed quicker than I could have imagined and undoubtedly as the best one. The sem was lit with parties and events, with a complete absence of any routine. The room had become a community space and the wing kept buzzing with delightful experiences, forming everlasting bonds and memories. The two awesome HSBC trips, movie nights, random night outs, appearing at doors in H9 C-bot, filmclub shoots, DE prep and so much, all culminating to this day. The day to leave campus.",
      "Last night on my final walk on campus as a student, the campus had magically become much more beautiful. It was more vibrant, more nostalgic, more worth every ounce of missed sleep. Yet there was something missing, a kind of dead silence engulfing it tightly like one pulls its blanket on a chilly night. Every corner had memories, once made so unknowingly only to come back, give an uneasy smile and leave wondering in retrospect.",
      "IITK is not a utopia, fair but it acts as an equilizer. An exception to other social institutions, who solely contribute to the illusion of meritocracy in our capitalist society. Many have been part of my journey, contributing in its making. This piece is a thank you to them for all the memories made, bonds forged and emotions shared. However small our stint was, post college we might meet or not, the togetherness will always be shared and cherished. Ending with this from Irfan Khan: ‚ÄúAur akhir mein jane dene ka naam hi zindagi h‚Ä¶‚Äù",

      "In the 13th edition of As We Leave, Shruti Goyal, a Y21 student from the Civil Engineering department, shares her IIT Kanpur journey through a diary entry, filled with scribbles and thoughts. She writes about the people who helped her grow, the friendships that made it all bearable, the PORs that shaped her experiences, and the campus spots that brought her peace. She ends with a sweet note to her future self, probably reminding herself that how she made it through IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Dear Diary,",
      "As I sit here getting ready to leave IITK, it finally hits me that another chapter is coming to an end. This one was special, unforgettable in every way. It brought both joy and sadness, wins and wipeouts, but above all, it brought growth. It‚Äôs hard to sum it all up, but I‚Äôll try my best to write it down before the memories begin to fade.",
      "I‚Äôm leaving this place with a bag full of memories. Some made me smile like an idiot, some made me cry in the middle of the night, but each one taught me something. These four years weren‚Äôt just about books and lectures; they were about long Zoom calls, silly fights, surprise friendships, heartbreaks I didn‚Äôt see coming, and academic comebacks I kept planning but never quite nailed.",
      "There were times I wanted to punch the wall and yell, ‚ÄúWhy did I even choose IITK?‚Äù But today, when I look around and realize I‚Äôm packing up my last few days here, my heart gets heavy. I know now that in order to start something new, you have to say goodbye to what once felt like your whole world.",
      "Even though I only got to spend three years on campus thanks to the online start, those three years were enough. They made me who I am ‚Äî one fall and one lesson at a time. So I‚Äôm writing all this down for future me, for that rainy evening when I might want to walk down memory lane. I hope when I do, these words remind me of how I lived through it all ‚Äî how I laughed through the pain, held on during the chaos, and kept growing into someone I‚Äôm proud of.",
      "Someone once said,‚ÄúThings don‚Äôt feel half as scary when you‚Äôve got your friends with you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get it back then, but I do now.",
      "From awkward ‚ÄúCan you hear me?‚Äù moments on video calls to dancing our hearts out during fests, I met people who slowly became my family.",
      "Prachi, Vrinda, Komal, and Sneha,¬† these girls are my solid ground. Whether it was getting me dressed for an event or picking me up (literally and emotionally) when I was drunk or broken, they never let go. We‚Äôve had our share of fights and cold wars, but real friendship isn‚Äôt about being perfect; it‚Äôs about always finding your way back. These girls taught me what ride-or-die truly means, and this page will always remind me of all the madness, love, and unfiltered support we shared.",
      "When I think about civil engineering, the first name that pops into my head isSandipan. Without him, I honestly don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve made it through those back-breaking courses. He wasn‚Äôt just a batchmate, he was my human diary. Someone I could rant to, cry to, and yet still laugh with. He stood by me quietly, never asking for credit but always showing up. To every junior stepping into civil,find your Sandipan. It‚Äôll make all the difference.",
      "And then there‚Äôs my crazy travel gang,Sandipan, Shrey, Shishir, Shambhavi, and Vedant.With them, every road trip felt like a mini movie. We fought over playlists, got lost more times than I can count, but somehow always ended up somewhere beautiful. That‚Äôs what happens when the company‚Äôs right, even the wrong turns feel just right. Those late-night talks, silly jokes, windy drives, and offbeat detours, they‚Äôre all locked in my heart.",
      "Some people weren‚Äôt around all the time, but their little gestures meant the world. A kind word, a random hug, or just being there when I needed them ‚ÄîGagan, Sonara, Sumit, Suraj, Srishti, Saumya, Aditi, Nikita, Rishwitha, Ashish, Harsh, Pandey, Rishi, Ravi, Prix, and Gaurish, you may not know it, but you made this journey brighter. Thank you.",
      "And oh, my seniors,Yuvraj, Harshal, and Yash‚Äî what started with respect turned into comfort and so much laughter. I never expected such friendships, but I‚Äôm grateful life surprised me.",
      "Last but not least, there‚ÄôsDevansh. He deserves a whole chapter, but I‚Äôll try to keep it short. Through the mess, madness, and quiet moments, he stood by me. Steady, calm, and always just‚Ä¶ there. He became my peace when everything else felt like a storm. Some people don‚Äôt need big words; their presence speaks loud enough.",
      "‚ÄúTook a POR to add a line to my resume‚Ä¶ ended up writing an entire drama instead.‚Äù",
      "Looking back, I can‚Äôt help but giggle at how I tanked my grades because of my PORs. Okay, okay‚Ä¶ maybe also because of my poor time management skills.",
      "In my second year, I went all in. Civil was already a mountain to climb, and I decided to hike with extra baggage: Udghosh, Techkriti, E-Cell, GnS, EC, and SoCE. Each POR came with its own circus ‚Äî midnight calls, planning that went sideways, and meetings that could‚Äôve been emails. But it also came with friendships, inside jokes, free merch, and lessons I‚Äôll carry forever. Somewhere along the way, I landed in the Udghosh Core Team, and that, truly, became one of my favorite chapters. PORs gave me the backstage pass to campus life. They taught me to lead, to pitch, to manage people and chaos, and most importantly,¬† to pretend I had it all together when I very clearly didn‚Äôt.To every junior reading this, join a club/cells/fests. You‚Äôll make friends, you‚Äôll learn things Google won‚Äôt teach you, and you‚Äôll mess up a lot. But you‚Äôll grow. And trust me, it‚Äôs worth it.",
      "Sure, my CGPA took a few hits (okay fine, more than a few), but what I gained was far bigger: confidence, people skills, and memories that make me smile when no one‚Äôs watching. If I had to go back, I‚Äôd still choose the chaos over a few extra marks any day.",
      "‚ÄúIn every corner of this campus, there‚Äôs a version of me that learned something new.‚Äù",
      "I found myself lost in memories and places, and I wonder what they‚Äôd say about me. About the versions of myself I left behind at each turn.",
      "SkywalkIt wasn‚Äôt just a bridge between buildings, it was a place where time slowed down and thoughts found their way. Lined with trees and lit by warm LEDs under the moon, it became my favorite spot to unwind. Night walks over scattered flowers, soft conversations under the stars, it felt like the campus was silently listening. Skywalk taught me that in the quiet walks between destinations, we often find the answers we weren‚Äôt even looking for.",
      "OATThis place was freedom in its purest form. No permissions needed, no questions asked, just the open sky and endless conversations. It was the spot for late-night chills, crazy cheering during events, and those loud laughs that echoed way past midnight.Whether it was a group of friends lying on the stairs, gossiping about everything and nothing, or couples whispering under the stars, OAT saw it all.OAT taught me that sometimes, the best moments are the unplanned ones. That you don‚Äôt always need a reason to be happy, just good company, open skies, and the freedom to be yourself.",
      "Lecture HallThe place where ‚Äúattendance was low, but hope was high.‚Äù I bunked more classes than I attended, made peace with the back row, and somehow still showed up on exam days confused, underprepared, and secretly dreaming of decent grades.There were days I zoned out completely, and others where I scribbled nonsense just to look busy. Lecture halls taught me that showing up late doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre out of the race. Everyone has their own way of learning and growing, and that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes, learning from the back is all you need to survive and even shine.",
      "DJAC RooftopWhenever life felt messy, this was my escape. Watching streetlights in silence, feeling the breeze, and sometimes catching a shooting star, it somehow made things feel a little clearer. And good company only made it better. This place taught me that when things get too loud inside your head, you need to climb a little higher. Sometimes, clarity comes from simply looking at life from above.",
      "DOAA CanteenThe only place on campus that never sleeps‚Äîjust like us during submissions. Their fried Maggi and that perfect cup of chai after a night out hit different. Even the army of mosquitoes couldn‚Äôt drive us away. It wasn‚Äôt always about comfort. It was about the people, the late-night hunger, and the little joys that turned into unforgettable memories.",
      "Hall 6Three years. Three rooms‚ÄîB602, B313, C418. Each one holds a piece of my heart. These walls witnessed everything: late-night breakdowns, endless laughter, quiet dreams, loud heartbreaks. The basketball court, the connector, even the rooftop solar panels knew my story. I‚Äôd lie there under the moon, sometimes with my girl gang, sometimes just with my thoughts‚Äîlooking up at the sky, hoping for answers to the chaos in my mind. Hall 6 taught me that healing doesn‚Äôt always come from running away. Sometimes, it comes from letting a place hold your chaos until you‚Äôre ready to let go.",
      "These aren‚Äôt just places. They‚Äôre pages of my story. Every corner of IITK holds a fragment of who I was, who I became, and the quiet in-betweens I didn‚Äôt even notice at the time. And if these places could talk, I think they‚Äôd smile and say,‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come a long way.‚Äù",
      "I came here as a noob, but I‚Äôm leaving with lessons that shaped me for life.",
      "So, here‚Äôs to you, IITK‚Äîmore than a campus, you were a chapter of my life I never wanted to end, but am grateful I lived.",
      "When you read this someday, remember this: life is messy, beautiful, hard, and amazing. You‚Äôve got scars and stories, but you also have strength and dreams. Keep chasing what makes your heart sing, never forget the friends who stood by you, and always make room for new adventures. And if things get tough, just sit down somewhere quiet, breathe, and remember where you came from. Because every ending is just a new beginning.",
      "So, IITK Goodbye for now, but not forever. Because no matter where I go, a little piece of me will always be wandering your halls, under your skies, and dreaming by your rooftops.",

      "Hi, I‚Äôm Havi Bohra from the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. If you‚Äôre a Y21, you probably remember me as the guy who used to ask a lot of questions during the online sem‚Äì or the one with less age.",
      "‚ÄúMTH is the toughest branch of IITK,‚ÄùI was told by teachers at my coaching during counselling. But as always, I thought,‚ÄúDekhi jayegi.‚Äù",
      "As the first sem was online, I thought everyone studies as they did in JEE, I used to be that serious and as said I asked a lot of doubts. Through online sessions by CS and clubs, I realized that here I‚Äôll be meeting a lot of different minds and I‚Äôm going to have a lot of fun. But as the sem progressed, my enthu decayed. It revived the moment I received the mail about coming to campus!!!",
      "I started making friends‚Äîbarely had any during the online sem. For a while, I had a routine: attend classes, sleep there in the front rows, do nothing during the day, and explore rooftops with friends at night.",
      "First monsoon at IITK presents itself and seeing lightning strike to block next to us with naked eyes was a next level thing to me. I joined Udghosh Hospi, Hindi Sahitya Sabha, PPOC. Out of which Hindi Sahitya Sabha really interested me the most ‚Äîand one of the best things it did for me was that it got me into reading books.. Third sem passed similarly to the second sem, doing academia, exploring things, places, clubs, etc. ‚Äîand having fun overall.",
      "As the sem ended, I realized I had no technical skills, so I started mailing profs to give me something to begin with. Only one prof replied positively and gave me a task to fine-tune a LLM. Obviously, I said yes (sikhlenge-krlenge kya hi chij hogi).¬† And guess what I did for the next 3 months? ‚Äî I learned python basics, created a basic html-css website and then watched basic ML Andrew NG videos.",
      "The most memorable thing I did in fourth sem was a Wing trip to Manali‚Äì Kheerganga‚Äì Shimla, the longest trip I‚Äôve ever had!",
      "Like most people, I had nothing much on my resume except for CPI. Stayed on campus for SURGE in the scorching summers to fill there something and learn DSA. I didn‚Äôt get many interviews on the day 1 but almost every company‚Äôs interview in the week for which I had applied. I got rejected in the first round of almost every company and in companies where I cleared all rounds with a good impression, I didn‚Äôt get an offer. I struggled with how to explain things and I was giving answers as I wrote in a doc for many questions related to my projects, even intro. Probably, I gave the most no. of interviews in the entire campus and got an offer finally 4 days before the endsems. Throughout the fifth sem, my only focus was to get an internship.¬† Continuously giving interviews, getting rejected, not focusing on acads, bad decision to not drop HSS (near to fail), facing two worst profs and courses combo of MTH- Complex Analysis and Several Variable Calculus, was almost how the sem went. I tried improving my technical skills, soft skills, applying off-campus interns, research interns, using contacts, referrals, everything that could get me something, but I was losing confidence in myself and almost stopped meeting anyone. But the good part was I never stopped trying and I did realize after this that ‚Äì it is only trying your best that matters and nothing else, prepare for the worst and face whatever comes without fear. I must thank Viplav Patel (Y19), Fahad (Y20) and some of my MTH friends who believed in me.",
      "Sixth sem started with the Banaras trip. I was still recovering myself from last sem, and messed around trying out various things together. Summers in Bengaluru were great, coz it‚Äôs monsoon there. I also went on Chikmagalur Trip, a 10/10 place for riding and natural beauty.",
      "As the final year began, I focused on placements, but this time with less fear as the previous year had taught me a lot. All went right. Best feeling after getting placed comes when helping and seeing friends getting placed.",
      "Final sem came, I was again pumped up with energy‚Äì not missing any chance to make memories and complete all the checkboxes of this campus. I went back to the rooftops,azeez yaaro ke sath bakchodi aur awaragardi.The Final trip with Wing for Goa, was again 10/10. Dance Extravaganza, Hall-1 Baarat,‚Ä¶ all the things ü´∞.",
      "It‚Äôs impossible to mention all the experiences I‚Äôve had here, but two things are definitely worth mentioning: MTH guys and Hall 5-Wing 9. Most of my friends are in these two groups, MTH guys have been super fun-super collaborative, those times in classes‚Äìlibrary‚Äìgroup chats and wherever we met, made me never doubt my ‚ÄúDekhi jayegi‚Äù decision. My wing has been the hub of all my bakchodi, with every kind of personality you can imagine hanging out there.",
      "Lastly, I can‚Äôt stop myself from borrowing a line from Jha‚Äôs AWL, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Stories like mine are only fun when they work out‚Ä¶‚Äù.",
      "I tried a lot to write this AWL in Hindi as suggested by one of my azeez Vrinda Sharma, unfortunately couldn‚Äôt make it to. Thanks to Mudita, CGM assigned to me, for being too patient as I always said to her ‚Äúkal likhta hu‚Äù. Also, thanks to azeez Utkarsh Agrawal for motivating me to write this AWL.",

      "In this 11th edition ofAs We Leave, Pratham Sahu, a Y21 from the Computer Science department, traces a journey of uncertainty, resilience, and rediscovery. From online friendships that turned into lifelong bonds to leading the Programming Club, interning in Korea, and navigating the internship and placement seasons ‚Äî his time at IITK was filled with detours and defining moments. Through breakdowns and breakthroughs, he found meaning not in titles but in people, passion, and perseverance. His story reminds us that there is no fixed formula for IITK ‚Äî just a campus, a community, and the courage to keep walking.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As the start of every other AWL goes, it ‚Äúis‚Äù hard to try and summarise your time at IITK and impart some wisdom to juniors in a single blog of 2000 words. This institute just gives and gives, it may be good times, bad ones, stressful ones, high ones and even the lowest ones. Reflecting upon the past 3.5 years, it‚Äôs been one hell of a journey. It‚Äôs a journey where you‚Äôre supposed to find yourself, but you have never been more confused. It‚Äôs a journey where you are supposed to keep walking, but you don‚Äôt know where to. It‚Äôs a journey where you meet hundreds of people and each of them tells you about a different destination. Sitting at the end of the road with 1200 others, some have found their destination, others are still searching. In this blog I am going to write about the stories that have shaped the version of myself I am today. At places I will give my 2 cents about important aspects of campus life like joining a club, placements, internships, etc.",
      "December 1st 2021: This was the date we were supposed to be joining ‚ÄúIIT Kanpur‚Äù. Yes, covid. Online classes, online bulla sessions, among us and sitting on zoom calls just talking about ourselves for 7-8 hours straight had become the norm. This was the time when I made friends who have stayed with me through the entire duration of four years.",
      "Around mid-February we received notifications that we would be on campus in April. This was one of my happiest moments. You dont join IIT for the academics, you join it for the campus, the people, and I was about to see the campus I had heard so much about.",
      "PS: We also pulled off a trip to Rishikesh just based on our online interactions. Here are some pictures.",
      "We joined campus in the first week of April in 2022. We were greeted by Antaragni, and dancing to the songs of Sunidhi Chauhan and vibing to Ritviz in the very first week of your campus life has got to be sick. This semester was hybrid and hence a lot of it passed in roaming IITK, random bulla sessions with seniors and others.",
      "During the second semester, One night I woke up with excruciating pain in my abdominal region. I somehow managed to cycle to the HC, where I was misdiagnosed with gastritis and given strong painkillers.When the pain returned, this time they referred me to Madhuraj. I reached there to find no doctors available. Called the doctor, went to his clinic. There I was advised to get admitted to the hospital immediately. Won‚Äôt go into further details, but I had gall bladder stones and was to get them removed. The state of medical facilities in Kanpur(including the HC) is pathetic. It took them 5 days to find out the cause and schedule a surgery for me. Until then my condition had worsened.¬† My father made a decision to fly me to Delhi, where all the tests(which took 5 days in Kanpur), would get done within 30 minutes and they were to place a stent(temporary fix before surgery, since I was adamant to not take a sem drop). I was out within 2 days and after spending a few days at home I was back on campus.",
      "Unfortunately for me, the stent did not hold up and after 2 weeks, the pain was back, and this time surgery was necessary. We decided to get the surgery done in Bangalore, (from where I hail), as it would be easier to recover. I missed multiple quizzes, and as always there were professors whose first questions would be ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you mail me earlier?‚Äù. How could I? I was high on painkillers most of the time and in excruciating pain the rest. This is not a generalisation, since on the other hand there were professors who genuinely cared and helped me catch up.",
      "However this was the time when my friends came to help. They would visit me at the hospital, submit my TA101 homeworks, assignments and what not to get my sem going. I will always be in their debt. Came back to campus with my mother 2 days before the end sems and tried to catch up. Ended up getting a decent CPI.",
      "This was a calm semester. I met someone who would go on to be my best friend on campus, my companion and someone who I could always trust in. This is a story for another time. This was also the time I joined the Programming Club as a secretary, and became a student guide. Being a student guide was one of the most fulfilling experiences of campus life. Guiding bachas through the ups and downs of college life, when you don‚Äôt really know how to navigate them yourself was fun. At the end of this semester, I had started applying for research internships as corporate internships are hard to find. I still remember that a bunch of us had gone to Mumbai for a trip at the end of December, to attend MoodIndigo. Whilst we were there, we took a day trip to Imagica, and my interview got scheduled for that very day. I still remember taking my interview from Imagica, and getting the internship offer there. Those were some good days.",
      "Joining a Club:Have enthu, but not too much. Stick to 2 or maximum 3 places where you think you would actually enjoy working. Don‚Äôt do it for the PORs, it‚Äôs really not worth it and it adds very less to your placement/intern. I think a very wrong notion that joining more PORs adds to your resume, trust me it does not. Not even if you want to be a consultant. Don‚Äôt be a jack of all, be a master of some.",
      "This semester I became much more involved with the Programming Club, and started taking more interests in the club‚Äôs working. I decided to apply for a coordinator and was selected to be one. I have had some wonderful times at Programming Club as¬† secy and a coordinator and have developed some of the closest friendships here. Sitting nights to develop PuppyLove, setting up problems for FPC, teaching stuff I love to juniors, were some of the best times.",
      "I personally believe this semester is one of the most toxic semesters you will face at IITK. I think a lot of people will agree with me. You start getting into a race for internships because it is the first time you face such a thing. However, personal opinion, you are not going to get anything by not sharing. I think it helps you more in the long run if you are someone who shares, and helps others.",
      "This summer, I went to Seoul, South Korea to pursue a research internship under Prof. Jonghyun Choi at Yonsei University. I had applied to machine learning roles, as I had explored only that apart from courses in my second year. Who would know, I would completely shift my field to Systems. This is what IITK is about, you get to make mistakes, find yourself and do it all over again. Coming back, the trip to Korea was amazing! Prof Jonghyun was one of the best professors I have ever met who made me accustomed to his lab and helped me with every aspect of moving to Korea. There is a language barrier in Korea, however if you love to travel(like me) it really doesn‚Äôt matter. I didn‚Äôt go anywhere outside Seoul, but Seoul was a beautiful city in itself. I wish to go back some time again.",
      "Landing Summer internships in second year:You can read my blog herehttps://prathamsahu52.github.io/post/research_intern/.",
      "Internship Season marked the beginning of this semester, and being a student from the CSE department made me overconfident about securing an offer on day one. I had only prepared for quant roles, neglecting competitive programming entirely. My overconfidence led me to take tests for just a handful of companies, and I didn‚Äôt even consider applying to day two companies. Reality hit hard‚ÄîI ended day one with no offers. Devastated, I took a quick flight home to clear my head but returned after three days only to face rejection again on day two. Finally, on day three, I received an offer from Adobe Research. This period became one of my lowest points; I felt isolated, thinking I was the only one facing such struggles, especially when most of my friends had secured placements effortlessly on day one. I used to cry myself to sleep in my room for multiple weeks after, asking god why me? I had completely different plans and ambitions from this, but time always does change. But through this challenging phase, I learned a critical lesson: there will always come a moment when everything seems impossible, the burden feels overwhelming, and quitting appears logical. Yet precisely at that moment‚Äîwhen you most want to quit‚Äîis when everything begins to change.",
      "After being placed for internship at Adobe, I told myself I will change, I will focus on what I love, Programming Club, Systems programming, among others. I also took a trip to Goa with my closest friends. I started working on puppylove 2.0 where I worked with some of my closest juniors, Gill, Shreya, Sameer and Yash.",
      "This semester I picked up some of the toughest courses of my department, as I was determined to learn from courses and further my interests in systems programming. I also participated in the ISC Student Cluster Competition, where we were the first team from India, and were competing against top universities like ETH Zurich, NUS. Our efforts were fruitful as we ended up 8th of 22 teams and we were one of the only few first time participating teams in the event. This semester was what we call ‚ÄúApne pair par kulhadi maarna‚Äù. Compilers, ISC, Linux Kernel were only the start of my concerns. Running PClub, elections, etc were the rest. But I was determined to do what I loved.",
      "Courses:Pick your interest and pursue it. Don‚Äôt chase easy OE‚Äôs and DE‚Äôs for grades. IITK can give you knowledge if you desire it, so don‚Äôt waste that opportunity because you wont get it again. Be thirsty for knowledge and everything else will follow.",
      "This summer, since I hail from Bangalore, I decided to travel to and from home as AdobeResearch was based in Bangalore. I used this summer to go to the gym, get back on doing a little bit of competitive programming and focus on placements. I had moved on from the coordinator of programming Club, however as I said, it wasn‚Äôt just a POR for me. I talked to folks from LinuxFoundation and Canonical to hold an open-source conference at IITK. Without realizing, I was leading a conference and handling its logistics with Rahbar. I think this was also some experience, dealing with the DOSA office, dealing with organizers, etc, teaches you a lot.",
      "CP vs no CP: I personally have never been a fan of doing competitive programming, but I am aware of how necessary it is for your internships and placements. However, I was determined that learning the algorithms is more important than blindly solving on interview bit, hence with that maturity, I focussed majorly on systems knowledge and algorithms, with bare minimum implementation practice. I believe this strategy worked for me, however everyone learns differently.",
      "I also used my intern money to travel to Amsterdam and Belgium this summer with my mother.",
      "This was the semester when the placement season took place. I had also planned to apply for masters and PhD programs in the US(and Europe) depending upon the university. A lot of my time went into applications, as I was more inclined on pursuing higher studies. This semester, almost every night we played 3-4 hours of poker(just coz recover karna tha), ignoring the placements completely(insanely stressful but fun times). I have made some of the best friendships of my time at IIT Kanpur in the final year at B-mid(x). Sharing ups and downs with these folks has made me what I am and I am indebted to them for it.",
      "This time I was confident of my skills in computer systems and algorithms, as I had spent a year actually focusing on learning the concepts, rather than doing it just for the placements. I decided to sit in the placements as a backup to my plans for higher studies. I was very fortunate to get a placement on day 1 session 1 at Graviton in the systems role, the one that I was passionate about. On achieving this, I decided not to apply to my safety schools and only applied to top schools and funded programs in the US. However this season was very bad especially for cse students due to funding cuts , and I ended up getting rejected from all of them.¬† I also attended the SC‚Äô25 conference in Atlanta this sem.",
      "As I may have mentioned before, I am a travel freak, and a group of us took a trip to Vietnam in December. We went to Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi and Da nang, partied, and had loads of fun.",
      "This was more or less a chill semester. I had very few credits left and I picked up a part time internship at a US based startup of IITK alumni who graduated more than 20 years back. Here I worked on what I loved and ended up getting a very attractive offer from them. However I decided to stick to graviton, due to my very hazy future plans and what my gut told me. We also took a trip to Thailand and it was one of the craziest trips of my life. I did every sort of water sport possible, failed in some of them, but enjoyed every single one of them. Koh Samui‚Äôs, ‚ÄúFull Moon Party‚Äù is something you must definitely attend in your 20‚Äôs. Poker didn‚Äôt stop. I also spent time with my wing mates and juniors. Parties didn‚Äôt stop and neither did ‚ÄúAll on me‚Äù(iykyk).",
      "The last few days at IIT were very tough. You were going home, but you were leaving another family and home behind. How do you let go of someone whom you‚Äôve cried with, laughed with, studied with? They will no longer be 2 rooms away or even in your same city. I think I will always have very fond memories of this place and IITK will hold the most special place in my heart.",
      "I think IITK is confusing. Everyone will tell you how to live, what to chase or what is success. A good placement? Good grades? Higher studies?. Their blueprint isn‚Äôt your map, they haven‚Äôt been through what you have gone through. Stop trying to fit into someone else‚Äôs formula. Go all in on what you think is right. It‚Äôs your life on campus.",

      "Hey everyone. As Vox Populi brings back ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù ‚Äî I wanted to share a bit of my own journey through IIT Kanpur. Every journey through this college is different, and it teaches us different things and there are a lot of such lessons that I‚Äôve recently introspected on quite a lot. As I write this on my last day at IIT Kanpur, the nostalgia that I am going through is something that is quite an experience in itself.",
      "",
      "Some of you reading this may possibly know me from the projects I mentored with EEA/ as an academic mentor, and that is because I believe that the number one, and in fact, the best thing I did here at IIT Kanpur was help people out, and I believe that‚Äôs the first message I‚Äôd like to give to all juniors as well ‚Äì is to keep helping people out. My entire life here has been marked by a lot of ups and downs and as I sit here, introspecting, I realise that EVERYTHING that has happened here, be it the unbearable lowest of the lows, to the best highs, was all for my good. All the friends I made or had a fall out with, everyone, played such a key role and I‚Äôd like to appreciate all of them ‚Äì from the bestest of my friends to whom I have written very detailed testimonials to even the people that I indirectly connected with. As I reminisce, I really hope I made an impact in somebody‚Äôs life through my mentorship roles.",
      "",
      "I remember how I was as I first came to IIT Kanpur ‚Äì the innocent boy that had studied all day while locking himself in his room for over a year. COVID-19 had basically taken away all of our social skills and there we were ‚Äì on campus with over 1200 students by April. Looking back on this first year, I realised that when I came here ‚Äì I was very socially immature and believed that I was always the best among whom I was around. Looking back on it, weren‚Äôt we all a bit immature as we came? And I think that‚Äôs one of the best parts of college. It‚Äôs about how you change as a person completely from the inside out. It‚Äôs about how that ego dies, and that ego death is something that has happened in my life personally over these four years.",
      "",
      "There are a lot of really common issues that I‚Äôd like to address in this AWL as well. The first of which is when people feel an extreme FOMO in their first year over the meaning of the phrase ‚Äúexplore in your first year.‚Äù People always believe that their purpose/meaning in what they do in life, academically or non academically must be something that is found by putting yourself ‚Äúout-there‚Äù as much as possible, by joining as many clubs as possible, societies as possible, and put as much time into extracurriculars and I feel this is such a major flaw in our reasoning here at IIT Kanpur.",
      "",
      "Exploring is such a vague concept, and it‚Äôs such a word that can be taken in so many ways. This very vagueness leads to a lot of first years having a lower CGPA than expected, and this blunder ends up ruining potential future opportunities as well. There is a very special message I‚Äôd like to address to such people feeling such FOMO: your purpose and meaning in what you would like to do with your life, is not something to be hunted for. It rather just comes to you, through your time here. Instead of exploring, the best advice would be to be in a position to keep your CGPA as high as possible in the first year. This is a real fact, and you would thank yourself for doing this, because trust me, a high CGPA is the first thing that allows you to do anything you want to.",
      "Another very important thing to start is DSA and competitive programming as well, possibly in your first year, because more the time you can devote to it, the better you get at it, and you always feel like you‚Äôre never good at it, so starting early is a very good choice to make. These two things are something that would carry you in all the seasons of internships and placements and if ever technical advice is needed over this, I‚Äôm always open for contact üôÇ",
      "As the famous Tame Impala song says, ‚Äúall this running around, trying to cover my shadow‚Äù ‚Äì is a line that I‚Äôd like to include in this AWL as a message to all those feeling stressed over the fact that they aren‚Äôt doing enough. Sometimes the best things in your life, such as finding what you want to do ‚Äújust happens‚Äù and that‚Äôs the beautiful part of life.",
      "As a college itself, IIT Kanpur has been one of the best places I have ever been, and as I write this on my last day on campus, nostalgia fills me a lot. Some of the best places I‚Äôve ever been alone on this campus include very weird places from sitting alone on the stage at the pronite ground at 7AM, to the so convenient rooftops of our hostel and other buildings, and I wish everyone could go there and appreciate the beauty of the place in which you live. Which other college has so much freedom? Do you ever stop to notice the trees? The patterns they form against the sunset? Do you ever stop to appreciate your friends, the role they play in your life? I feel like we must all stop to appreciate these small moments, that we take so granted, because as we leave, you realise that, that is what makes you up.",
      "I‚Äôd like to end this whole story with a really nice lyric from this one song by Kanye West that explains the entire journey of college ‚Äì ‚Äúeverything I‚Äôm not made everything I am.‚Äù I could explain it to you, what it means, but I feel like it‚Äôs something you should explore yourself üòâ Please do explore for now xD.",

      "In this 9th edition ofAs We Leave, Nishant Patel, Y21 student from the Electrical Engineering department, shares his journey through a rollercoaster of memorie, from online semesters and chaotic quizzes to wild nights in Hall 1, deep friendships, and the unexpected lessons that made his time at IIT Kanpur truly unforgettable.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "I write this, now that I have somewhat accepted the very fact that my IITK chapter has been completed and this will be a way to tell you my journey. After many failed attempts, asking other people if they‚Äôd be writing or not and asking Zainoob multiple times to help me, here I am, on a Sunday morning, questioning if I‚Äôll be able to complete this. I‚Äôm still not ready to bid goodbye to IITK people who made that place feel like home. I‚Äôll take every chance to relive those moments, alas, we won‚Äôt be getting too many. Coming back to AWL, I‚Äôm doubting if I can write my college experience in some 2k words. But since we are taking this as a challenge, I‚Äôll try to cover most of it.",
      "Okay, so I think I did almost everything the campus had to offer. Maintained my acads on a decent level, took PORs (7 iirc in 2nd year), got very much involved in the elections (not directly), did every event in the GC with my beloved hall (Jai Bhawani, Jai Shivaji), got myself a decent intern, got a return offer, wandered and roamed around every corner of the campus and even got a fine in the last for partying so hard that the wardens got scared. I was never a guy who can only study or do something quietly, I‚Äôm glad that I found the apt peers to do the other things that made these 4 years memorable.",
      "Toh chaliye shuru karte hai‚Ä¶. We started off as an online batch, had so many first year plans and expectations but ah, we could only wait. My first quiz happened, it was of PHY102, and I scored -2, yes negative 2 in that test when the class average was 11 out of 15. I was shocked, I realised ki padna toh yaha bhi padega. But thank god, I wasn‚Äôt alone in this situation. I got my first gem, Himanshu (aka chotu or mechanical), he had also scored similar marks. Our daddy wing warned us not to involve in any ‚Äúmalpractices‚Äù as the Y20 batch had gotten a lot of Fs for getting caught. But still, some day i got added into a small group for learning purposes obviously, lol. Till midsems, i realised that not everyone is scoring by studying, andmujhe bhi behti ganga me haath dhul lene chahiye.So, online sem was mostly around this small group only, sitting on zoom before every quiz or exam, random late night bulla sessions, thanks to¬† saksham‚Äôs fitjee unlimited ZOOM links, some bullshit games by Zainab. I also met Rachit Gupta, who‚Äôd be playing valo during the quiz and would wait for me to finish my quiz and then give him my answers, such a bitch thing to do, to bully me like that.",
      "Side note ‚Äì Unpopular opinion but I liked TA101.",
      "So after this monotonous online sem, finally we were called to campus, and I took my excited ass to campus on the very first day(2nd apr, 2022). After making my room a living space, I left for the campus exploration as all other Y21s were doing at that point. I remember Udghosh was being held, and we were not allowed to attend any of the events following the new batch on campus regulations. But as you can guess, we ignored that and went to cheer for our teams playing in that scorching heat. And what I experienced there, made me realise thatsaare engineering launde ek jaise hote, chahe iit se hi kyu naa ho.Moving forward, Chotu‚Äôs and Bitthal‚Äôs rooms became our adda. Everyday was full of new things. Before Midsems arrived, we had already attended Sunidhi Chauhan and Ritviz, completed our fun orientation, hopped onpanchi banu udta firu iss gagan meinin acad area, went on all popular buildings‚Äô terraces and got chased and eventually got caught by SIS guards for doing something stupid in the residential area. Then we had our first ‚Äúoffline‚Äù exams and everyone got serious. Rest of the semester was around acads only. SnT projects and recruitment tests are fun ngl. The vacation before our sophomore year brought me a surprise, you already know if you should know it. Curtains on my short but very happening first year!",
      "First half of 2ndyear brought many reality checks. You have to keep up with the pacy life, maintain your acads as your department courses had started, do projects, look for good PoRs and obviously do all this while being involved in all thebakchodisthat your wing or other groups were doing. Till then, I had my core group formed, not a great name (Raands) but a bunch of goated people, had enough interactions in my wing, got mybatti systummpeople to pass my courses and some great friends. By the end of 3rdsem, everyone was prepping for their interns, and I was there with no plans of that.",
      "Okay so let me tell you a side story-",
      "I was a dropper with no plans of JEE in my 12thclass. My main motive was to get a good board percentage so that I could get a good college in DU and then prep for UPSC, so I didn‚Äôt give that year‚Äôs JEE Mains. Moving forward, my last exam was held on 19 or 20thmarch iirc, and after that lockdown was waiting for me as a surprise. After almost 3 months of random shit at my dadi ghar with my notorious cousins, finally the result came on 13thof July, I had performed well and was happy that I‚Äôll surely get a good college now. But DU admissions were getting late and late, and a close friend of my dad recommended me to start prep for JEE, why waste my time waiting when I can get the DU seat next year also. So, with not so much interest, I started the prep and now when I have lived the iit dream, I‚Äôm kinda grateful for covid to have given me that chance.",
      "Coming back, so when all the other friends of mine were building their resumes, I was chilling as I thought to not sit for intern drive coz of upsc plans. But in December, when I told my parents about this, they answered back in typical Indian parents style. They saidabhi ek sem hai, iit gaye ho toh backup lekar hi niklo na, sabke sath intern prep karoge toh ho hi jayegi.4th sem started, I also started looking for some projects for my resume. Another weak point was I hadn‚Äôt done any coding other than esc101 (i had hindi in 12thL). I left it for the summer. I‚Äôll be always grateful for the intern prep gang. I had people who‚Äôll help me in literally every domain. Rachit, Monkesh, Srijan, Panjwani, Zainab, Sibtain, Panda brothers and Sahaj to name a few. Monkesh and Sahaj would literally teach me company specific topics one day before the interviews. I also had to manage the APC work along with this. In a blink of an eye, it was day 1. Intern drive was a little of a hard time, cried a few times but at last finally got one.",
      "Once my intern was sorted, I had only 2 tasks to do ‚Äì first, to keep my cpi>8.5, credits to Nitya who told me that you‚Äôll get a distinction degree for doing that. Second was to do every other thing that the campus and the people here had to offer.",
      "After coming back from intern, we had to shift to hall 1. That is the place where you live your best college life. Almost all your 1styear friends are back again in the same hall. I got a PPO but many of my friends didn‚Äôt. So, 7thsem was more about helping others in the placement preparation and making them pass the courses that I was doing with them. I would literally make 5 different copies of an assignment so that they can just submit on mookit. For the first time in college, I had gone to 9am classes and took notes and that was in this sem as all others were busy with prep and late-night tests.",
      "Then came December, all my friends got placed, yay. We went for a small trip in Jan start. Came back to H1 and this is where peak engineering experience would start. There will be something crazy going on everytime. You‚Äôll be randomly partying and dancing, go on a ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù trip, even wear black sunglasses on a random SOBER night and roam around all over the campus. Saksham and Palash would be there for the morning sutta and sesh, which will go on forever till we pass out. Akshay‚Äôs room would becomedharamshala, Himanshu and wing for ‚Äúgravity‚Äù, Sahil and Tejas for random gossips and dancing, Bitthal, Chad and Kausti for random booty squeezing, Arko and Teja for late night rolling paper and the list goes on. Everyday was so happening, you would just love being there. Play cricket, football, tennis, badminton. We also had a dunk fight, went to almost every wing and water water everywhere. I also got a fine for partying as some random ass person had complained to the warden with my room number. That night, we called itwildfire. Whole wing, dancing shirtless, most of them beingbhand, and to top it all, bursting a cracker on the face of the warden and then running and disappearing from his sight. Crazy night.H1 is all bout getting high and moj-mastiing all the time.Surely the greatest time I had spent on campus.",
      "I‚Äôll put my college take-aways in the following one or two liner points but will let my emotional side take over for a moment and say ‚ÄìKabhi kabhi lagta hai dosti ek local train jaise hoti hai ‚Äî sab ek station se chadhte hain, ek saath safar karte hain, maze karte hain‚Ä¶ par fir har kisi ka apna station aata hai, aur log utarte jaate hain. Main bas yeh chahta hoonki yeh safar thoda aur lamba ho jaye. Kyunki chahe yeh log zyada purane nahi hain meri life mein, par dil ke bohot kareeb hain. Aur main abhi unse door nahi hona chahta.",
      "So, ending my AWL by listing my college take-aways and some personal facts, in no order-",

      "In this 8th edition ofAs We Leave, Garvit Digarwal, a Y21 from BSBE, shares a journey marked by late starts, rejections, leadership, and quiet resilience. From missing his first weeks at IITK to leading Techkriti‚Äôs show management, and finding healing in teaching at Prayas, he reflects on growth beyond titles ‚Äî where small habits, tough choices, and staying true to oneself make all the difference.Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "My journey at IIT Kanpur began in December 2021 ‚Äî a time when the world was still recovering from the pandemic‚Äôs grip. Just one more month of delay, and we might‚Äôve been the first batch to start our degree in a year that didn‚Äôt even match our batch name. Funny how life almost rewrites your timeline, right?",
      "Back in December, while I was caught up in some family functions ‚Äî being the chill guy I am ‚Äî I had this strange feeling that maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôd get a call from someone saying, ‚ÄúHey, classes are starting today‚Ä¶ you better join in.‚Äù But no such call came. Why? Well, I was pretty much off social media back then, and let‚Äôs just say myBappuwasn‚Äôt exactly on Insta either.",
      "So December‚Ä¶ and even half of January 2022‚Ä¶ just slipped by. No classes, no updates, no clue.It was only when I finally reconnected with some friends that I realized what I had missed. But instead of panicking, I picked myself up. I worked hard to catch up. My mid-sem grades? Pretty bad. But by the end of the semester, I managed to pull through with a decent CPI.",
      "We finally stepped into the real IITK experience in April 2022. First time living away from home‚Ä¶ first time in a hostel.Honestly? It wasn‚Äôt the dreamy campus life I had imagined. But I got lucky ‚Äî a decent roommate, chill wingies, and slowly, campus life began to unfold.",
      "And then‚Ä¶ the real struggle began.",
      "I didn‚Äôt get selected for my dream cell ‚Äî the Entrepreneurship Cell ‚Äî all because I didn‚Äôt know the name of a senior. Yes, that actually happened. Then came the Counseling Service selections‚Ä¶ and again, I wasn‚Äôt chosen for Amma-Bappu culture, thanks to my CPI. But I wasn‚Äôt alone ‚Äî none of my five bhai‚Äôs made it either. And somehow, that made it easier to accept.",
      "Still, something in me stirred. That rejection pushed me ‚Äî I started focusing more on academics. Slowly but surely, I raised my CPI.",
      "Because our semester had started late, we didn‚Äôt get a summer break. We were pushed straight into second year ‚Äî no breathing room. But in that pressure, something clicked. I began working harder ‚Äî in studies, in finding space in clubs, in exploring campus life beyond academics.",
      "And then, things started turning around.",
      "I got intoTechkriti, thanks to the support of my Bappu and our Bappu Wing.I also joinedPrayas, a society dedicated to teaching underprivileged children near the campus. The kids there? Pure energy. Their excitement for learning lit a fire in me every single time I went. They gave me more than I could ever give them.",
      "By the end of second year, in May 2023, I finally felt like the person I‚Äôd always wanted to become. I cracked interviews for core team positions ‚Äî Techkriti, Prayas ‚Äî and in third year, I proudly took over asHead of Show Managementfor Techkriti, one of the most demanding and respected roles",
      "Life isn‚Äôt easy for anyone ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt for me either. Taking up the responsibility of aHeadin Techkriti shaped me in ways I never expected. It helped me grow, build meaningful connections across campus and beyond, and understand leadership not just as a title ‚Äî but as a test of patience, humility, and persistence.",
      "We conductedTOSC‚ÄîTechkriti Open School Championship‚Äî an annual exam designed to spark curiosity in students from Classes 6 to 12.Phase 1 was online, and Phase 2 brought selected students to our very own IIT Kanpur for a campus tour and final round. We even launched theSR Program, offering free participation to underprivileged students. It wasn‚Äôt record-breaking, but we had good participation and decent cash flow ‚Äî enough to feel proud.",
      "That period was packed with adrenaline. Visiting every school in and around Kanpur ‚Äî even Lucknow ‚Äî taught me more than any lecture ever could.One moment I‚Äôll never forget: We were in Lucknow, exhausted from school visits. My friend (a Y22) and I found a fancy-looking restaurant to charge our nearly-dead phones and grab lunch. We gave our phones at the counter‚Ä¶ then opened the menu ‚Äî not a single item under ‚Çπ1000. We locked eyes, both silently thinking: ‚ÄúBro, are we at Right place?‚Äù",
      "And then the waiter came, we dodged him.",
      "We hatched an escape plan ‚Äî one of us would leave with the bags, the other would grab the phones, pretend to call a friend outside due to ‚Äúbad network,‚Äù and vanish.Mission success. And the laughter that followed‚Ä¶ man, that‚Äôs what memories are made of.Phase 2 of TOSCwas executed with passion. But deep down, I knew ‚Äî there was more we could have done. Something better to be built for the future. I hope those who come after us take it further.",
      "But not everything was rosy.A serious issue started growing within the core team. It was affecting the team‚Äôs energy and culture. No one addressed it, so I took the initiative. Things started improving, slowly. But pushing further meant risking my academics ‚Äî and as an average student, that risk wasn‚Äôt small. One wrong step, and I‚Äôd be staring at multiple Fs.",
      "I made a hard call. OnJanuary 25, I resigned.",
      "What followed wasn‚Äôt easy. My mental and social health dipped. There was backlash ‚Äî some from seniors, some from batchmates. Most understood why I stepped down, but very few stood by me.",
      "One thing kept me afloat ‚ÄîPrayas.",
      "I returned to teach kids who looked up to us for guidance, unaware of what I was going through. But somewhere in that process, I realized something ‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just me helping them, they were healing me too.Their curiosity, their smiles‚Ä¶ it gave me strength.",
      "Unlike many Y21 batchmates who became managers, I didn‚Äôt apply. I chose to stay as a volunteer. And I don‚Äôt regret that.I became one of the longest-serving volunteers in Prayas, and that joy of consistent contribution ‚Äî it mattered more than any title.",
      "Around this time, a new fire sparked in me. I began questioning everything ‚Äî from the nano world of cells to the vast scale of galaxies.What‚Äôs my role in this world?How do I live meaningfully?",
      "I started again ‚Äî from scratch. I built a daily schedule, began reading books, started asking questions again ‚Äî the foundation of learning. That curiosity brought me toBIOSoc, our department‚Äôs new society, where I became theOverall Coordinator.",
      "Here, I met new friends ‚Äî each with their own strengths, perspectives, and quirks. And I‚Äôve been trying to learn from all of them.",
      "No matter how bad things get ‚Äî time moves. If you show resilience, it bends in your favor. You grow. You learn. You become stronger.",
      "So, to the juniors reading this ‚Äî if I could leave you with a few tips IwishI had followed earlier‚Ä¶ here they are.",
      "Eating Healthy is the Luxurious ThingHealthy eating won‚Äôt give you overnight results ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the best long-term investment you‚Äôll ever make. Fruits, veggies, and home-cooked meals nourish not just your body but your focus, your energy, and your emotions. Ask yourself before biting into that fast food:Am I eating for my tongue, or for my body?",
      "Drink 4 Litres of Water Every Day ‚Äì Make It a ChallengeA senior once told me:Buy four 1-litre bottles. Fill them at 5 PM. Your challenge? Finish them all before 5 PM the next day.I copied it. It worked. Proper hydration fixed more problems than I realized ‚Äî tiredness, mood, and even skin. Try it once. Your body will thank you.",
      "In This Competitive World, Build a Collaborative OneDon‚Äôt just compete ‚Äîcollaborate. The people around you aren‚Äôt just your peers; they‚Äôre your potential partners in creating something meaningful. You‚Äôll grow faster and farther when you grow together.",
      "Start Reading Books ‚Äì Any Book, Any Genre, Just StartBooks will become your quietest but most powerful friends. They‚Äôll teach you what YouTube can‚Äôt ‚Äî patience, depth, and the art of reflection. Start anywhere ‚Äî fiction, non-fiction, whatever draws you in.But if you need a push, start withEgo is the Enemyby Ryan Holiday. It changed how I looked at failure, identity, and ambition.",
      "You Can Always Start Again ‚Äî Stronger and SmarterWhether it‚Äôs a failed project, a bad grade, or a rough week ‚Äî you always have the right to restart.What matters is how you rise, not how you fall.",
      "Learn from People, Not Just BooksEveryone around you knows something you don‚Äôt ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt always need to be the smartest in the room. Sometimes, just being the one who listens can teach you more than any lecture.",
      "Success is a Daily Habit,The secret is simple: small wins, done consistently. Waking up on time. Finishing that one chapter. Helping one person.",
      "Do that long enough, and one day, you‚Äôll look back and realize ‚Äîyou‚Äôve built a life you‚Äôre proud of.",
      "If you‚Äôre reading this, I have one simple but important request:Take care of your body‚Äî especially now, when you‚Äôre young. Build habits that will allow you to age gracefully, with health and strength. Your future self will thank you for the effort you put in today. Remember, there will be moments where you‚Äôll need to make tough decisions. I encourage you to always take theright call‚Äî not the easy one.",
      "Alongside that,help otherswhen you can. It doesn‚Äôt always require joining an NGO ‚Äî sometimes, it‚Äôs as simple as helping a stranger fix their cycle chain when they‚Äôre in trouble.Small acts of kindnesscan go a long way.",
      "Incorporate small, good habits into your routine, and stick to them. They might not change everything overnight, but they‚Äôll build the foundation for a life worth living.",
      "And finally, remember this: You can‚Äôt create a perfect world around you. But you cancreate a positive environmentby focusing on the things within your control ‚Äî your actions, your mindset, and your attitude.",
      "Make it count.",
      "This journey has been full of ups and downs, learnings and unlearning, but most importantly ‚Äî growth. I‚Äôm deeply grateful to everyone who stood by me, even in silence. To the friends who listened, the students of Prayas who unknowingly healed me, the mentors who challenged me, and the setbacks that shaped me ‚Äî thank you.",
      "And a special thanks toVox Populifor helping me pen this chapter of my life.Mitanshi and the entire team‚Äî your effort in bringing our stories to light truly means a lot.",

      "In this 7th edition of As We Leave, Nitish Kumar Trivedi, a Y21 Chemical Engineering graduate, reflects on a journey shaped by friendship, creativity, and growth. Starting with Zoom calls during the online semester, he found his place in Fursat Mandli and the MnC Council, balancing performances, cultural responsibilities, academics, and placements. From rehearsals to events, and challenges to small wins, his time at IIT Kanpur was about much more than just academics.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "College started with random WhatsApp groups, awkward intros, and glitchy Zoom calls. Divyansh‚Äîthe one constant since Class 9‚Äîwas there with me through it all. But being an extrovert, I was always eager to meet more people and build new bonds.",
      "In the middle of all that online chaos, I met Anushka (another Indori), Ashutosh, and Prerna. Soon, I got to know a few folks from Chemical and we formed the legendary ‚ÄúCHE Chhota Group.‚Äù Prerna and Sneh became the virtual sisters, celebrating Rakshabandhan every year without fail. Ashutosh and Divyansh kept the group lively with their not-so-funny jokes, Zainab handled all the gossip updates, Shorya wore the ‚Äúrotlu‚Äù tag proudly, and Saumya and Tanya turned the chat into an anime fan club. Then came Pranjal Singh‚Äîour offline addition and the go-to guy for any academic help.",
      "As things moved ahead, I joined Techkriti as a junior executive alongside the MnP Panchayat‚ÄîAnubhav (who still owes us a party), Chitresh, and Jai. That journey introduced me to more people who stayed till the end‚ÄîPranjal (my pseudo-roomie), Batra (my personal motivator), Pulkit (the Hall 2 alarm clock), Pratibha (who went from acquaintance to close friend), Atharv (the branch changer who did it all), and Jatin (the one and only OPC).",
      "From those awkward online intros to friendships that carried me through college‚Äîthis is where it all began.",
      "I began my journey in Fursat Mandli by participating in an online competition called ‚ÄúCurtain Calls.‚Äù Though I didn‚Äôt win, I had a lot of fun trying. Shortly after, I took part in the online freshers for both the Dramatics Club (performing a sketch) and Humour House (doing a stand-up)‚Äîmy first and last attempt at stand-up, for reasons now obvious to me.",
      "When the offline semester began, I got inspired watching the seniors perform the street play Koop Mandook and the stage play Baaki Itihaas. Their energy and passion were contagious, convincing me to continue with the club. When the forms for Dramatics Eve were out, I was among the first to sign up, full of enthusiasm. However, the first few days were tough‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt getting any roles and spent most of my time singing songs. I even thought about quitting, but then, almost magically, I was assigned two roles the very next day. Unfortunately, both got cut by the seniors at the last moment. Watching their performances, I realized I still had a long way to go.",
      "We started preparing for Antaragni, and in between, we were also told that we will participate in Thomso as a pre-fest event. But just days before the mid-semester break, Antaragni was cancelled, leaving us devastated and unsure about Thomso. Thanks to the seniors‚Äô encouragement, we pushed through and practiced relentlessly. Despite our efforts, the Thomso prelims didn‚Äôt go well, but the journey taught us resilience and unity.",
      "Then came Inter IIT, where our refreshed team put in hard work and delivered a strong nukkad performance. Unfortunately, the journey from Kanpur to Madras took a toll on us‚Äîmany including myself fell sick due to the long, uncomfortable sleeper journey. Despite that, we finished 5th in street play, a respectable achievement given the circumstances.",
      "Back home, our results improved steadily. We secured 2nd place in Antaragni for both street and stage plays. Soon I, along with Aryan (Dabur), Prajapati, and Narottam, won the Dramatics Cup for Hall 2 in Galaxy‚Äîa proud moment for all of us.",
      "Shortly after, I became coordinator along with Sushmit (Flow), Gurudutt, and Bhawin (Play). Now Bothra (Flow), Eesh (charra expert), AVJ (Playboi), Narottam (idea expert), Prajapati (nagada chipku), Dabur (my writing partner), and Divyansh (pata nahi kab gayab ho jaata hai) formed the core team who stood by us through all the ups and downs.",
      "As our tenure progressed, Antaragni preparations began in full swing. Sushmit and Devabrata led the flow, while Aryan (Dabur) and I focused on writing songs. We rewrote our medley multiple times, facing setbacks and frustration. Our initial draft was rejected by the team, which was heartbreaking. But after 2-3 days of nonstop writing, even during classes, we finalized a new version that everyone accepted.",
      "The club then celebrated a gold medal in stage play at Rendezvous‚Äîa proud milestone. Energised, we aimed to win gold in street play at Antaragni. Though prelims were shaky, we pushed hard and gave one of the best performances in recent years, finally clinching the gold‚Äîa thrilling, unforgettable moment.",
      "Following that, we staged Copenhagen in collaboration with Prof. Manoj K. Harbola. This was a special occasion with many professors, including the Dean and Director, attending.",
      "Next up was Inter IIT again. We were prepared and confident. Our street play earned appreciation from everyone who watched, but we settled for bronze, less than what we deserved. We were even disqualified in the stage play and didn‚Äôt secure any positions in mime or mono act, which was a total¬† disappointment after such a good practice.",
      "After a few months, I ran for the Institute Secretary of Performing Arts and was elected. This new role came with different responsibilities and a new team‚ÄîLakshay (Gensec), Ishan, and Divyansh. Despite many ups and downs, this tenure was the most successful in terms of medals won at the Inter IIT Cultural Meet.",
      "Among our significant achievements were passing a resolution in the Senate and successfully passing the PCR of Galaxy after seven years. We also staged Breaking the Code, my only performed stage play, again in collaboration with Prof. Harbola.",
      "My cultural journey at IIT Kanpur culminated with a performance at the Dance Extravaganza, closing a memorable chapter filled with friendship and memories.",
      "The summer of 2023 marked the beginning of my internship preparation. I initially tried coding but couldn‚Äôt find the motivation and soon drifted into binge-watching shows, completely neglecting my goals. As a result, I failed to secure an on-campus internship. Through a family connection, I landed an off-campus internship in core chemical engineering‚Äîbut during that stint, I realized that core wasn‚Äôt for me.",
      "Determined to pivot, I enrolled in aData Science and Machine Learningcourse and restarted coding‚Äîthis time with full commitment. I immersed myself in projects, sharpened my skills, and felt hopeful as placement season approached.",
      "I submitted resumes and gave tests that went well. There was also a case involving a company that I can‚Äôt speak about, which added to the uncertainty. As shortlists rolled out in late November, I was hit hard‚Äîno shortlist on Day 1.1. On Day 1.2, I faced rejection in my first interview. My second chance that day went better: I cleared the GD and first round, but the final round didn‚Äôt go great. I was waitlisted and spent the next 5‚Äì6 hours in emotional turmoil.",
      "Finally, the offer came‚ÄîfromBattery Smart. That moment felt like a breakthrough, not just professionally, but personally.",
      "This journey taught me more than any course could‚Äîabout focus, perseverance, and the value of true friendships. The support from my friends and juniors, who stood by me during the toughest moments, meant everything. In the end, it wasn‚Äôt just about getting placed‚Äîit was about rediscovering myself and rising after a fall.",
      "My final year wing in Hall 1 holds a special place in my heart. It was where I found not just friends, but a close-knit family ‚Äî the ones who shared every moment of fun, from placement test stress to carefree cricket matches. Though I‚Äôd known many since first year, it was in this last year that our bond truly deepened.",
      "Rooms F-208 to F-224 were more than just spaces; they were hubs of laughter, late-night hangouts, and endless memories. I‚Äôll never forget watching Dadda get playfully teased by the civil engineering gang ‚Äî moments like those brought much-needed relief from the pressure around us.",
      "The party room, F-222, was our go-to spot for unwinding and celebrating, always alive with energy and warmth. Meanwhile, F-210 and F-213 were the corners for serious talks, dreams, and support‚Äîplaces where we lifted each other up through every challenge.",
      "Looking back, I‚Äôm grateful for that wing, those friends, and the unforgettable moments that became my true support system and family away from home.",
      "Looking back, IIT Kanpur was never just about academics or achievements, it was about the friendships that became family, the late nights full of laughter and struggles, and the countless moments that shaped who I am today. As this chapter closes, I‚Äôm not just saying goodbye to a place but carrying forward the lessons, memories, and bonds that will stay with me forever. The future is uncertain, but with this foundation, I‚Äôm excited to face whatever comes next, ready to learn, grow, and keep building the story ahead.",

      "In this 5th edition of As We Leave, Reetika Gupta a Y21 student from Biological Science and Bioengineering Department shares her journey at IIT Kanpur. She shares her journey through Badminton, various clubs, friendships and the importance of living every moment to the fullest.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "For me college was a blur of deadlines, late-night conversations, and spontaneous adventures‚Äîbut most of all, it was the people who felt like home. I remember one night in particular: my last fest. Four of us girls were dancing, arms slung around each other, a circle of sweat, laughter, and rhythm. And then,something shifted. Our smiles trembled, and without warning, the tears came as we reminisced through our entire IITK journey.",
      "My IITK journey was like a tidal surge. It had an extremely chaotic start but the ending seems calm and peaceful. What you can expect is a lot of badminton(although i love swimming more), BSBE, self depreciation,movies,quizzing and being grateful for all the people around me. This campus will forever be my most treasured memory and I doubt I can relive these moments ever again.",
      "Moreover me like many others I swear by the line:",
      "‚ÄúHope the prof takes care of my CPI‚Äù",
      "~baseline wolves",
      "‚ÄúI was like a caterpillar in its cocoon wrapped up in my own delusions waiting for a traumatic kick to free me out‚Äù",
      "My campus life started off with a rough start. I felt really depleted initially. I juggled through academics, sports (I had joined the Badmintons team and had to undergo a rigorous 3/4 hour training everyday), friends( were not as great as I recall) , MnC clubs (I was in 3 of them ‚Äì humour house, film club and ELS {and even PPOC [but wont match my baddie lifestyle so would be hidden]}) and naturally everything suffered. The dehydration, weariness and heat made it hard for me to even sleep. The times I did ‚Äì I would wake up with muscle spasms.",
      "This was also the time I changed my branch from Civil to BSBE, something unusual on campus but I never regretted it. However my refusal to study or cheat properly ended up costing me and my academics a ton. I lived under the shadows of my cousin Nandita -a Y18 here( I flex a lot about her)",
      "Badminton was scary for me back then. I had a constant fear of the coach (probably the reason I was on court otherwise I would have lazed around) and was scared of the seniors. However I remember the first intra-team individual tournament that changed everything for me. I remember Faiz suggesting that I do an entire professional entry (with the music ‚Äúkuch kariye‚Äùand kitback everything) and that ended with laughter and killed the fear I had of the interactions. My favourite seniors were the extremely chaotic Navya and the generous and lively faiz.",
      "Inter-IITs preparatory periods (begins somewhere around November end) are the bittersweet memories I have. The intense debating that goes through the selection process, the kill-throat competitiveness in the team(thanks to the y19 captains who supported me) and not to forget misogynism by some of the players(and they ended up being the captains later, phew!) keeps you on your toes.Moreover getting up at 6 in Kanpur winters to run probably 7-8 kms is a herculean task (I think even hercules would love to snooze the alarm and doze off under a blanket¬† in a foggy cold winter morning). Yet the worst for me was yet to come. I had a massive muscle pull during practice .It was so bad that I couldn‚Äôt walk outside the court (warmups and the court‚Äôs energy is contagious enough for you to practice and run on court but not be able to walk outside it). Moreover I avoided telling anyone cause I feared I would be replaced{which I almost was but that‚Äôs another story}. However it was all worthwhile for the on court fun and a scrumptious team meal after the exhausting day. And therefore somehow I reached my first Inter-IIT (party to banti hai!!)",
      "I worked a lot in ELS and had applied for the coordinator position. I conducted and hosted events and tried my hardest to engage with the club. My coordinator interview (generally all coordi interviews here are a .22 bullet shot willingly taken to your self perception and image. The mission and vision are extremely clear: 4 good for nothing frustrated with life seniors will make you feel worthless. But what I won‚Äôt admit is that the interview helped me build a character and gain confidence that I will carry for the rest of my life) henceforth was messy. Not being the coordinator for me was a bolt out of the blue yet I accepted it for I felt I did lack the necessary skills. Also thanks to ishita( was one of the els coordinators and was a cutie!!) I felt better. All this just led to my cinephile era.",
      "I met Teja on my first day on campus and it was friendship at first sight (almost like love at first sight but instead of a cupid it‚Äôs just Philotes or Hanumanji striking you). I just knew we would be together till the very end and I was right.Teja is the reason for my laughter, he is there when I am sad, he is there when I feel anxious and he is probably my longest reigning friendship in my life. He is kind, cute,cuddly,caring and one of the best human beans you would come across.",
      "Summers in IIT Kanpur are intolerable- hot, sweaty,tiring and also as I remember vividly -lonely.But it was the summer that changed my life for the better. I became closer to my existing friends- Teja,Priyanshi(my behen),Rohit and Arnav.",
      "I remember waking up at 8 just to watch movies. I slept watching a movie. I ate while watching a movie.I watched so many of them I doubt anyone watched more movies than I did. For me movies are a way to escape reality and enter into a sphere created by the director. I believe a good movie is as mentally exhausting as a good book~ the intricate dialogues, cinematography and direction are worth your while.I made a new friend- Manasvi who then introduced me to Shruti and Varshitha.Shruti is a person whom I admire a lot. She is talented, smart and she takes care of me as if i were her baby(yes I am secretly her lover-beware her future partner I fight),Manasvi is extremely hardworking (though the most apt description for her is that of a chhoti behen-cute,shy and sweet) and finally Varshitha, the reason for the two consecutive golds by the institute female volleyball team (yet was looted of an Institute blue).",
      "And then came the turning point, I met Siya. Siya is passionate, commanding with a killer face card and eyes so sparkly you wonder what makes her so excited about life. She brings the best out of me and treats me like her younger sister.I remember going to the extremely hot 6th floor just to hangout with Siya and Khushi- two people I just can‚Äôt get enough of.",
      "In the days that ensued adventures with my girl gang proceeded- the takeover of H.Cs 1st floor(although still in construction), solar panel parties,going to random hall days are just a jist of what my memory can conjure (and what can be legally written)",
      "It was also during this time I became the badminton Coordinator in GnS as well as the female captain for the institute badminton team. I had to be more regular on court which resulted in better bonding with everyone in the team. Faiz, Sanjay, Pradeep and Amrit served as a guiding light to everyone on the team. The new Y22/Y23 girls team- Avanee, Paki, Vasudha ,Samanvitha, Neela and Ananya were fun to be with. I played¬† 4 tournaments within a span of a few months- Spardha(IIT BHU sports festival, Sporttek (IIT Delhi Sports Festival), Inter-IIT (held in Bombay) and UDGHOSH (in IIT Kanpur).",
      "Moreover, I built a rapport thoroughly with my branchmates through the weekly labs we had. I won‚Äôt lie but the Y21 BSBE batch will go down in history as the most well associated branches in IITK. All the group study sessions, lab experiments, late night hangout sessions and parties made us all a closer brunch. I will miss my branchmates~ each and every one of them a lot.",
      "Even semesters are the best. Why? One word- Galaxy. I love galaxy quizzes- the competitiveness, the energy, the happiness when you get the right answer, the nerdiness, the pressure everything combines giving you an *Experience*. My quiz partner- ammu were thick as thieves almost to the point i think we had a telepathy. Apart from that I loved participating in¬† JAM,DumbC.",
      "‚ÄúVeera Sada taiyar hai",
      "Veera sada taiyaar hai‚Äù",
      "I remember the winning galaxy parade from hall 6 to every boys hall. I was beating a big drum while the girls shouted in unison. History was created and I am glad I was part of it.",
      "This was also the time i grew closer to my branch mates- Priyanshi ,Sahil, Khushi, Utpal,Vivek,Sujal, Tanuja, Kanishk,deepak and many more. We hung out a lot, The late night visits to MFCEM or BSBE building according to our mood (take that you other shared building or one building branches).I learned a lot from them academically- going to classes everyday, making notes ,sitting down in first bench all while having fun.Priyanshi is bubbly and amiable, Sahil is straightforward and a good hearted guy, Utpal is brilliant and benign, Vivek as helpful and good natured as a person can be and well sujal is the funny and coolest one in the group and together we watched movies, went to restaurants and hung out all day in Hall 12.",
      "Kanpur winters though chilling are also comforting once the Inter-IIT sessions end. It is so cold that stepping out of your warm blanket is taxing but put on a few layers of sweaters and warmers and mix that with a couple of energetic friends like I have and it‚Äôs the best season. Garnish that with a roommate like priyanshi- extremely lazy and talkative and its heaven. (Side note: hall6 should continue its room delivering services. On the peak of our laziness this service was our saviour. The only energy we spent was on debating who would open the door for aunty). Another memorable part were the neighbours I had. Khushi and SIya lived next door,the ever smiling and kind Divya and Geethanjali lived in front of us. And Sahil was a daily visitor. Life was worth living!!",
      "Khushi and Tanuja are also one of my closest friends. Khushi is hysterical, courteous and is always there for me( and i will be there for her too) and Tanuja is my baby. She is brilliant and always gassed to take on new adventures with a smile ever so bright.",
      "Apart from that the baddie team had new recruits- Karthikeyan KB : a Tamil state champion who loved hip hop more than I did and yogesh. KB is one of the closest people I have here on campus. He always motivated me to do better and the CCD talks are what I will remember. I loved third wheeling him and Jaya(was my roomate, innocent and energetic like a small puppy) and discussing south movies with him.(also thanks for that yummy south indian food on Tamil New Years and in Saravana Bhavan)",
      "",
      "Unexpectedly in my last year I went to classes everyday and tried to focus on my academics, probably trying to cover up . Interestingly I grew fond of molecular biology, biomaterials and tissue engineering.In Fact I even did a UGP. Inspired by Abhimanyu- another spirited badminton teammate, I joined PRAYAAS. I taught 8th and 10th grade social science and it was the most humbling and invaluable experience of my life.",
      "Although the placement semester was pretty boring (mostly because i didn‚Äôt sit for placements). I found solace in keeping my room clean(courtesy also to my floor aunty-Soni) which now lacks a space for me even to stand and my bed is just one giant mess I slide through somewhere to sleep.I even made friends with seniors- Milan especially who inspired me to do so much more in life.He is such a sweetheart- always helping others wherever he could,working diligently and that crazy work ethic inspired me a lot.I danced in DE with my girl group along with somya, ananya and Anushree.I even did a trip to tirthan(a scenic place in himachal) with Priyanshi and Sahil .",
      "The farewell parties from the badminton team, BSBE branch, film club and finally from my girls made me grateful for what I had.",
      "Moreover, it‚Äôs now that I appreciate the campus beauty even more- the red gulmohar trees, yellow golden shower trees, the pretty flowers, the dogs- putput, and the bulldog are all embedded deep in my memories. Waking up to hear birds chirping, the random peacock sighting and the beautiful red buildings is what I will yearn for everyday. I will thoroughly miss this campus and its people.",
      "As I leave I am filled with tears. Leaving IITK has left a hole in my heart and a hollowness i dont think can be filled again.",

      "In this 5th edition of As We Leave, Shivansh Gupta, a Y21 student graduating from the Department of Economic Sciences, reflects on his time at IITK not just as a campus, but as a lifetime lived in miniature. From the rush of responsibility to quiet moments of self-discovery, he shares how adulthood on campus became a mirror for real life‚Äîfull of questions, growth, and gratitude. What if your years here weren‚Äôt just preparation for life, but a parallel to it? Dive into a story where every semester echoes a new stage of living, and leaving is just the start of another beginning.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "As I leave this campus‚Ä¶",
      "‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a strange quietness settling in. The kind that comes not from the absence of noise but from the presence of a thousand memories brushing past all at once. Hallways I once rushed through now ask me to slow down. Places I barely noticed now seem to stare back. And somewhere between the sound of packing tape and farewell hugs, I find myself wondering‚Äînot just about what I did here but about what this place really was.",
      "Because IIT Kanpur wasn‚Äôt just a college. It was a life. A full one. It had its childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and now, in its old age, it feels like a time to reflect, to forgive, to thank, and to understand.",
      "In these eight semesters, I didn‚Äôt just pass courses ‚Äì I passed through versions of myself.Made decisions that echoed longer than I thought they would. Met people who, knowingly or not, changed me. Faced questions I thought were too early for my age. And found that this place quietly mirrors the life we‚Äôre all heading into ‚Äì just compressed into four years. So maybe, instead of looking at college as a break before ‚Äúreal life‚Äù, we should treat it for what it truly is‚Äì a rehearsal, a simulation, a very real version of life itself.",
      "This isn‚Äôt just a story of my time here.It‚Äôs a journey through that life.And maybe, in revisiting it, you‚Äôll find glimpses of your own too.",
      "‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this place?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do I fit in?‚Äù ‚ÄúWill I be able to survive this place?‚Äù",
      "Like most babies dropped into a new world, I entered IIT Kanpur with big eyes, a clean slate, and no clue what to expect.",
      "The first semester felt like crawling in a jungle gym where everyone else seemed to be sprinting. People around me were cracking codes ‚Äì literally and socially, while I was still figuring out how to break the ice, within the complexities of an online semester.",
      "I remember standing in Audi during Orientation, smiling awkwardly at strangers, unsure whether they‚Äôd become lifelong friends or just classmates I‚Äôd forget. I didn‚Äôt talk much at first. I observed. I noticed how fast things moved, how people bonded, and how quickly expectations started building.",
      "‚ÄúChapu banna hai‚Äùwas a phrase that echoed in my head a lot ‚Äì though I wasn‚Äôt sure what it even fully meant. Was it about CPI? PoRs? Coding? Coolness?Looking back, I think the confusion was the point. Childhood isn‚Äôt about having answers‚Äîit‚Äôs about absorbing the world without filters.",
      "And slowly, I did. I started stepping out more, began to take part in competitions, and tried not to look awkward during conversations.",
      "The second semester felt like taking my first few steps without falling every time. I had found some footing ‚Äì friends in the wing, a circle I could laugh with, and spaces where I didn‚Äôt feel invisible.",
      "I was still unsure, still asking questions like a child, but now the questions were changing:‚ÄúWhat do I enjoy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho do I vibe with?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere do I want to spend my energy?‚Äù",
      "And somewhere between club orientations, late-night talks, and rides around campus, I stumbled upon my first bit of gyan from IITK:In the beginning, everyone feels lost. You don‚Äôt need to be the fastest runner. You just need to enjoy learning how to walk, and most importantly, keep moving.",
      "The toddler learns to walk, and now chooses where to go: ‚ÄúWhere do I want to spend my time? What truly matters here? What kind of person am I becoming?‚Äù",
      "These third and fourth semesters felt like growing into early adulthood ‚Äî with each club/ cell recruitment, play turning into purpose. The carefree ‚Äúexploration‚Äù of earlier days gave way to deliberate club choices. It wasn‚Äôt about trying everything anymore; it was about committing, building, and doing things well.",
      "FAC became a big part of my life then. I wasn‚Äôt just attending events‚ÄîI was leading, competing, and mentoring. New experiences like grinding endlessly during Inter IIT and competitions, planning and executing events, bonding with batchmates during SPO duties, and not to forget the big fat parties, were coming in fast. For the first time, I felt the joy of creating something bigger than myself. I also started saying no to some clubs and activities, not from burnout but from clarity. I understood my limits, my priorities, and the importance of doing justice to the commitments I made, not only professionally, but personally. That winter, exposure to SPO hit me with the reality of placements and life in the latter half of IITK.",
      "But the real magic wasn‚Äôt in building a perfect resume ‚Äì it was in how I started seeing myself differently. By having bullas with friends, doing side fun activities during intense pressure times, and spending nights listening to life situations (and trying to resolve them), I learned what it meant to be consistent, dependable, and thoughtful ‚Äì not just in work, but in relationships too. Late-night rants, long walks, or simply being there for others weren‚Äôt just ways of spending time ‚Äì they were moments that quietly built trust, deepened connection, and nurtured a kind of growth no bullet point could ever capture.",
      "Looking back, this phase redefined how I valued my time, trust, and contribution. I might not have seemed emotionally available then ‚Äì maybe I looked distant or too focused‚Äîbut I appreciated deeply those who stood by me, gave me space, and stayed connected.",
      "These semesters taught me:Identity is a work in progress. You‚Äôll question yourself a lot, but that‚Äôs part of growing. Don‚Äôt rush it‚Äîlet the process unfold.",
      "The teen soon realises, and questions the practicalities of the harsh life: ‚ÄúWhy does everything feel heavier now?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do you keep going when there‚Äôs too much on your plate?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs this what it means to grow up?‚Äù",
      "Somewhere between the thrill of exploring and the calm of reflecting, there comes a phase where things simply demand more, be it the intern drive, the club work, or the deepening relations, it‚Äôs like being needed in places that matter. And with that came the kind of growth that‚Äôs less visible but far more defining.This is adulthood.",
      "The fifth semester began at a pace that didn‚Äôt allow much pause. Club responsibilities had deepened ‚Äì coordinating events, mentoring juniors, staying active in council work‚Äîall the while managing the emotional turbulence. There was barely a moment untouched by some form of responsibility.",
      "And yet, amidst the chaos, something shifted. A rhythm emerged. Not a perfect one ‚Äì but a lived one. Pitching for sponsors for NCW, and juggling the Inter IIT prep camp with the friends‚Äô intern BT, it became clear that growing up wasn‚Äôt about mastering everything. It was about learning how to stay grounded when things got uncertain. Learning how to function when nothing slows down. There were days when academics had to be managed with minimal preparation, but even in that, there was a quiet trust in the process that had been built. A different kind of learning was unfolding ‚Äì one that had less to do with syllabus and more with self-discipline, balance, and quiet confidence ‚Äì a confidence that things will just get through.",
      "Leadership, too, took on a deeper meaning. It wasn‚Äôt about being at the center of things or always winning. It was aboutbeing there‚Äîshowing up even when the odds were stacked against you, even when you knew the outcome might not go your way. I understood this more clearly during my second Inter IIT, when uncertainty loomed large. But still, I chose to lead ‚Äì not because success was guaranteed, but because presence itself mattered. Leadership, I realized, wasn‚Äôt about backing off when the path looked tough. Sometimes it was just about standing firm and tall, for others to hold steady. It was during that time I realised:¬† when responsibilities grow, it‚Äôs not just strength butpresence and supportthat keep things moving.",
      "As the sixth semester began, the tempo remained high, but the internal lens shifted. There was a growing awareness of time ‚Äì how limited it was, how fast it moved. And for the first time, I started observing myself more closely. Why do I sometimes withdraw when things get overwhelming? Why do I appear distant even when I care deeply? I understood then ‚Äì it‚Äôs not coldness; it‚Äôs myinternal way of processing. I may not always speak in big words or grand gestures, but I always feel deeply. I‚Äôve always wanted to be there for people, even if I didn‚Äôt always know how to show it. This piece is my attempt to say that.",
      "Semesters 5 and 6 were not just phases ‚Äì they were a mirror to what adulthood might look like: demanding yet meaningful, exhausting yet rewarding. A life full of expectations, yes‚Äîbut also full of people, of gratitude, and of inner clarity.",
      "And perhaps the most valuable lesson from this phase was this:Growing up isn‚Äôt about becoming harder. It‚Äôs about staying soft, even when things get tough. And finding strength not in doing it all alone, but in walking with those who make the weight lighter.",
      "The man begins to slow, not from weakness, but to finally look back at the road: ‚ÄúWhere have I reached?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù",
      "By the time I reached my seventh semester, the question that hovered in my mind was no longer restless or urgent. It arrived gently, like a quiet breath after a long run‚Äîa moment to pause, sit down, and look back. For the first time in four years, I wasn‚Äôt running. No club to coordinate, no internship deadlines to chase, no sleepless strategy sessions. The familiar chaos had settled. And in that stillness, there was something strange‚Äîalmost unsettling.",
      "I had a PPO in hand‚Äîa symbol of achievement that should have felt like a summit. But the summer internship had taught me that not all victories feel like home. Instead of rushing forward, I found myself quietly reflecting on what truly mattered‚Äînot just the career I wanted, but the life I wanted to live.",
      "And that‚Äôs when one of the deepest truths of this life struck me.It‚Äôs not about where you start. It‚Äôs about where you want to saturate.Saturation ‚Äì not in the sense of giving up, but of choosing to pause the hustle. Of deciding to enjoy what you‚Äôve built rather than constantly chasing the next thing.",
      "The time wasn‚Äôt about big, flashy milestones. It was deeply personal‚Äîa semester dedicated to rebuilding clarity within. While college buzzed around me with placement talks, canteen chatters, and looming deadlines, I was learning to slow down and turn inward. I spent more time reading, reflecting, and being alone‚Äînot lonely, but in quiet contemplation. To some, I may have seemed distant or quieter. But that silence wasn‚Äôt a distance from others. It was me, finally becoming closer to myself.",
      "Yet even in that quiet season, I was not alone. There were wingies (both old & new) who dropped by, juniors seeking advice, and friends who shared peaceful night walks. These moments reminded me that connection doesn‚Äôt always need words. Sometimes, just being there is enough.",
      "Then came the eighth semester‚Äîa slow, gentle unfolding filled with warmth and bittersweet emotions.",
      "For once, there was time‚Äîtime to pause, to feel proud of the boy who nervously walked into IIT Kanpur four years ago, full of hope and confusion. Time to grieve the parts of myself left behind, and to silently thank every friend, senior, junior, and batchmate who helped me grow.",
      "Graduation events‚Äîthe dance extravaganza, batch photos, testimonials, and final farewells‚Äîwere more than rituals. They were reminders of the shared moments that shaped us. As I watched friends dance, laughed with them one last time, and stood for the batch photo, a rush of emotions hit me: pride, nostalgia, gratitude, and an aching sense of closure.",
      "It was in these moments that I understood something vital about life‚Äînot just about achieving or ticking boxes, but aboutbeing.",
      "Life is not about rushing toward an endpoint or collecting accomplishments. It‚Äôs about holding onto the childlike wonder‚Äîthe open mind that stays curious, eager to learn, and experience. Because when you stop learning, when you convince yourself you‚Äôve ‚Äúdone enough,‚Äù life becomes monotonous. It loses its spark.",
      "The real joy, I‚Äôve found, lies not incompletingbut incontinuing.",
      "To truly enjoy life, you have to stay young at heart. Be open to new things. Embrace every experience as if it‚Äôs new, no matter how many times you‚Äôve seen it before. Life isn‚Äôt about growing old; it‚Äôs about growing young‚Äîabout learning, experimenting, and executing with fresh eyes and an open spirit.",
      "To all the friends, seniors, juniors, and batchmates‚Äîthank you. For believing in me when I was unsure. For pushing me when I doubted, trusting me when I faltered, laughing with me when I soared, and walking beside me when I slowed down.",
      "And if, at times, I seemed hard to reach‚Äîknow it was never about you. I‚Äôve always lived a little quietly, a little inward. But I cared‚Äîdeeply‚Äîeven if I didn‚Äôt always say it. I noticed. I remembered. I carried those moments with me. I still do. And I hope, in your own way, you felt that.",
      "College didn‚Äôt just teach me who I wanted to become. It taught me how to become.",
      "From the wide-eyed infant of first year to the reflective old soul of final semester, I‚Äôve lived an entire lifetime on this campus. And now, as that old soul folds up these years like a fading photograph‚Äîcreased at the corners, warm with memory‚ÄîI find myself smiling.",
      "Because IIT Kanpur was never just a campus, it was a lifetime.",
      "And what a beautiful life it was.",

From the online semesters to the vibrant chaos of campus life, he shares stories of late-night jam sessions, academic highs and lows, moments of doubt, and the friendships that carried him through it all. In this honest and heartfelt reflection, he shows us how every phase shaped him into who he is today, leaving behind a melody of memories that will echo long after¬†he‚Äôs¬†gone.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Life is too short, the here and the now, and you‚Äôre only given one shot",
      "‚ÄúJitne jaldi ho sake yaha se nikalo,‚Äù was one of the first pieces of advice I got from a Y17 senior in my first few days on campus. I dismissed that advice, thinking that his frustration towards the campus stemmed from his own inabilities, and I certainly would do better. But in the next few years, I cycled through that feeling, and its complete opposite, multiple times.",
      "Being a part of the ‚ÄúCovid batch‚Äù, college began in lockdown ‚Äî Zoom lectures, HelloIITK assignments, sticker spam on WhatsApp, dreaded Codetantra and Gradescope exams, random Discord listening sessions, and forgotten platforms like Acadly and Brihaspati. I was genuinely excited to finally study real mathematics (yes, I loved MTH101) and physics, and start my journey to become a physicist after a long and extended JEE prep. However, my best online sem memory comes from our freshers CS:GO competition, in the finals of which, we were trailing 10-15, somehow managed to tie 15-15, the extended match also tied 18-18, and eventually winning 22-19. All this while one of us was on a trackpad, another had just installed the game the day before, and I had to play on battery due to a power cut.",
      "After two more long and monotonous online semesters, stepping onto campus felt like opening a new chapter. We finally lived our delayed first-year experience ‚Äî meeting new people and old friends in person, late-night bulla sessions, night-outs, endless photos, GPLs, ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù sessions, parties and whatnot. I also got to finally enter the music club and jam with people. I performed on stage for the very first time in front of hundreds of people. Luckily, I was even made the Music club coordinator, which, honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect.¬† All was going well.",
      "The dream is like a song, it leads you on and on. The piper plays his tune so you must follow.",
      "Third year was harsh. Interested in research, I opted out of SPO internships and applied for research ones; however, though I got shortlisted in many places, I got rejected everywhere. My grades dipped. The coordinator workload was becoming way too much to handle. I started ignoring food and sleep, due to which my physical health declined. All of this affected me mentally as well. The intense summer heat, mess food, and the highly inefficient workings of the ‚ÄúSarkari‚Äù hall office and DOSA office, all made me reconsider that advice and I wanted to get out of campus asap. By the end of the third year, burnt out, physically drained, and mentally checked out, the words didn‚Äôt sound bitter, they sounded true.",
      "Being rejected in research, I considered applying for SPO internships, and I was determined to go in full grind mode in the summers after my 3rdyear, targeting a quant intern while managing a couple of physics research projects. Midway through the summer, I got seriously ill and had to be hospitalized for a week. This took a whole month out of my prep as my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me go to campus until I was fully healthy. This setback completely derailed my plans. Fortunately, thanks to a strong profile and some good past work, I got shortlisted in consulting, but ultimately, I landed an internship (and later PPO) in finance, for which I hardly prepared. The one thing that helped me immensely in the interview was my confidence and the ‚Äújo hoga dekha jayega, kuch na kuch to kar lenge‚Äù attitude, something which I developed after constantly thugging it out in my 3rdyear. The funny thing is, I started college interested in physics research, applied for SPO internship aiming for quant/SDE, got shortlisted in consulting, and finally bagged an offer in finance.",
      "This little-bit-of-everything ‚Äì all the small things, like a jigsaw falling into place ‚Äì is how I think I can describe my college life best. I‚Äôve had friends across the spectrum ‚Äî the 9 pointers, the so-called maggus, as well as those who barely passed, the chaapus, the lassus, the bakaits, the passion follow karne wale and the money lovers, the teetotalers and the opposites you know of. I always had something to like and learn from everyone, hear everyone‚Äôs stories and share an aspect of mine as well. And this is the one advice I‚Äôd like to give to any junior ‚Äì Explore people, places, passions, and let them change you. Your room is just for sleeping, spend your time outside, exploring, making friends and memories, learning something, growing, hear and try to understand the diverse range of thoughts, emotions and aspirations of everyone in the campus, and develop a broader perspective of life and world.",
      "After the year-long intern stress finally ended, life felt good again, all the fun was back, and I changed my opinion on that advice again. In fact, I got so chilled out that my grades reached the minima in the 7thsem. But I didn‚Äôt care much as I had reached the final 4 months with my friends here, the 8thsemester. As much as it sounds clich√©, and as much as I cringed whenever I heard such statements from others, those 4 months were probably the best time I ever had. Reconnected with old friends, hung out and partied with current ones, and made new friends. My mental and physical health bounced back, my grades rose, the BT vanished, and I felt completely at peace, with myself and everyone. And, except for that one blot on 13thApril 2024 (which still haunts me), those 4 months were perfect. Perfect. Every day was an event, something to celebrate, something to hang out, something to party. The photoshoots, batch video shoots, farewells, graduating ME, year-end party, farewell karaoke. It was perfect. I wanted these moments to last forever, I wished never to leave the campus.",
      "The hardest part of ending is starting again.",
      "But after a while, you realize time flies, and the best thing you can do is take whatever comes to you. 9thsem stood pale in comparison to its predecessor. After months of living like every day was a celebration, reality slowly crept back in. The farewells were over, the rooms a little quieter, and the energy on campus had shifted. Most of my friends had graduated and all of a sudden the classes were boring, the wing and hall lost their spark, Mclub didn‚Äôt feel like the home it used to be. But perhaps it wasn‚Äôt meant to; places change, and so do we. What lingered were the memories and the people who had become my constants.",
      "The sun is the same in a relative way, but you‚Äôre older. Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.",
      "Throughout my undergrad, there were three constant sources of fun and support: the music club, the physics gang, and wingies.",
      "My Mclub coordinator tenure was an unusually stressful one, being the first offline tenure after COVID, and I often contemplated quitting. I remember when Rakshit and I were once sitting at the SAC stairs, the ones in front of Mclub, at around 3-4 am, when we encountered a new hurdle on top of already a hundred obstacles, thinking ‚ÄúHow tf do we get out of this one?‚Äù. In that moment, I was so overwhelmed that I started laughing, partly because it was funny how such an improbable series of everything that can go wrong went wrong and stacked up, and partly because that was the only thing that could keep me sane in that mess. Mclub taught me a lot ‚Äì communication, leadership, time management, and the biggest of all, the attitude and toughness to face any challenge head-on and not worry about it too much.",
      "But better than these resume points was the music and the friends. It was an absolute delight to go in there and jam to your favorite songs every day and then perform them on stage. I loved sharing, discussing, and listening to music. I found a community that shared a similar love for metal, rock, and punk music. PerformingBoulevard of Broken Dreams, the song which inspired me to pick up an instrument, and the moment when a random non-IITK guy cheered on me all excited as I played the opening notes of46&2during synchronicity soundcheck, are among the highlights of my college experience. The red-padded walls echoing our riffs, chai-paratha-fuelled nights, andar wala room, 4 a.m. harmonies that bled into sunrise and empty OAT mornings, the synergetic high you get when everyone is in perfect sync during practice, are some things I‚Äôll cherish forever.",
      "If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôll miss more than the music or the campus, it‚Äôs the people ‚Äî each one adding their own chord to the melody of these years.",
      "I loved performing all my fav songs with Rakshit, right fromKaise HuatoTrue Love Waits, from whom I also got to learn that soft skills like leadership and people management, although often overlooked, are just as important and impactful as any other work. The clutches with Kunal ‚Äì winning CSGO in the first year, pulling off first position in (eventually scrapped) galaxy band competition with just 2 days‚Äô prep, and finally coveringSharp Edgesafter 2 years of excuses, on our last day on campus. The constant fights with Ritick, the classical curse of Datey, and the bonds with Aadarsh, Anushka, and Nivin. The seniors ‚Äì the metal connection Adarsh and Aniruddh, Vinoba (OP) with the classic ‚Äúbass badhao‚Äù, the jams with Raju (jamming the unplanned ‚Äúthe tempo song‚Äù is one of my best Mclub memory), the debates with Rajit proving metal is objectively superior to jazz, the memories with Khyathi, Ramdas and Baijal. The juniors ‚Äì black metal,blackmetal, and the andar wala room discussions with Arpit, Porcupine tree, and ‚Äúcounselling‚Äù Madan, the physics-Mclub gang of Arnav, Samarth, Chitresh, and Ritick, all the songs, fun and bonding with Benison, Mridul, Virmani, Gattani, Samprit, Prabal.",
      "The physics people with whom I loved discussing and learning physics, and all the fun in between. The constant philosophy, feel, and gyan modna of Nakul, the rivalry and treat-bets with Srivishnu (still 2 treats pending). The lab classes, although packed with some cool experiments and some rather tedious ones, were often like a department hangout spot with the optics dark rooms and ACs. The constant mischief and badmosi with Bawne inside those labs as well as outside, the continuous RR, BT, and guitar repair with Sahil and Keval, and the time spent with Kalash, Bhavya, and Srujan. Seniors like Saad and Harish also helped a lot during times of inevitable BT regarding career options every physics student goes through.",
      "My roommates and wingies were the ones who had seen me through all my BT phases. The times with Armeet and Arka, the H2 Bob Marley room, the discussions of C133 which shall remain in C133 (until one of us becomes a CEO or something, upon which, it would be used for blackmailing), Sarath was my go to friend in online sems, bulla, poker and movie nights with Kanha, Goyal and Raghav. Armeet is probably the only one who has seen all my faces and phases of college life. One of the best things about IITK ‚Äî and Hall 1 especially ‚Äî was that no matter where you were going, you‚Äôd run into at least 4‚Äì5 people along the way saying, ‚ÄúAur bhai, kya chal raha hai?‚Äù. My friendships weren‚Äôt just restricted to these groups. I bonded on Linkin Park, metal, and music with Arpit and Mahaveer. Doing OS assignments with Prem, while everyone was out celebrating Diwali. There are too many people with whom I spent a lot of good time, and I know I‚Äôll always gonna miss out someone or the other. Please don‚Äôt get mad at me.",
      "The late night and early morning walks, sunrises and at H2 terrace and sunsets in the quad, L20 ledge, OAT, yellow daylight and blue twilight shades of acad area. Getting out of bed at 7:58 for an 8 am lecture, being called out numerous times for sleeping in class, the exam rush, the assignment anxiety, and the unprepared quizzes. The list goes on and on as the beat goes around and round. I‚Äôm never gonna cover everything. But that‚Äôs the beautiful part.",
      "They say ‚ÄúLife is too short‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe here and the now‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only given one shot‚ÄùBut could there be more, Have I lived before or could this be all that we‚Äôve got?",
      "As I look back, it‚Äôs hard to summarize what IITK truly meant to me, because it wasn‚Äôt just one thing. It was a constant back-and-forth between extremes: joy and stress, success and setbacks, friendships and solitude. In many ways, our batch had a uniquely turbulent journey. Experiencing first year in online lockdown mode, searching for jobs during layoffs and economic downturn, and applying for a PhD during US funding cuts and global uncertainty. Almost every phase of our college life came with an asterisk. But maybe that‚Äôs what made us tougher, learning to move forward even when the odds didn‚Äôt play fair. But through it all, this place shaped me, not just academically or professionally, but as a person. It gave me people I‚Äôll always carry with me, memories I‚Äôll never stop revisiting, and lessons I didn‚Äôt even know I was learning at the time. Maybe that Y17 senior wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong; there were times I wanted to leave. But now, as I prepare to leave for real, I know a part of me will always want to stay.",
      "And though another day may steal your dreams away, you and the song will always stay together",
      "As the shadow of the day embraces the world in gray, and the sun sets forever over Blackwater Park, I am to bid you farewell. I realise that the summers are always slipping away. The good old days were always now.",
      "I have been inspired, loved and supported by a lot of people here, and hopefully, I might have returned the favor to some of you. I‚Äôm grateful for everyone I got to share this stage with. May we get a chance to do some of this one more time, and as Feynman said, ‚ÄúLet it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!‚Äù",

      "In this 3rd edition of As We Leave, Anuj Sarda, a Y21 student graduating from the Department of Mathematics, looks back at his IITK journey marked by unexpected turns, quiet perseverance, and moments of joy, growth, and deep connection. From online beginnings to on-ground chaos, his story captures the essence of navigating ITK with humour, heart, and a whole lot of hustle.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IITK.",
      "Four years ago, we took one of the toughest exams in the country‚Äîcompeting with over 10 lakh students‚Äîand somehow, we made it. I landed in MTH, full of dreams, with the echoes of our Kota mentors still ringing‚Äî‚ÄúAb toh majje hi majje!‚ÄùThat dream phase? Yeah, it began‚Ä¶but lasted only a few days.Then came the CPI blows, dragging reality right behind them.",
      "We were the COVID batch‚Äîeverything started online. Zoom calls replaced wing meets, and our first friends came through breakout rooms and Counseling Service sessions. Amid this digital haze, I unexpectedly found my‚ÄòBaapu‚Äô‚Äîthank you, CS, for that!",
      "Exams arrived. Cheating followed (a lot of it). I was good at coding and basically ran an underground ESC101 support center. Ironically, even though I was in the Math department, I always tanked my MTH courses‚Äîthe best I ever managed was a B+ in DC (thanks, Numerical Methods). But hey, the chill OEs, ESO, and HSS kept my CPI in the ‚Äòsocially acceptable‚Äô range.",
      "Then came the message:campus reopening. What a feeling! I‚Äôd packed on weight during JEE prep, so before stepping onto campus, I went full Rocky Balboa‚Äînighttime fasting, 2km runs. And then, hostel life began.",
      "Triple room, Rahul and Anuj, and a wing that never studied‚Äîexcept the night before endsems. Prabal‚Äôs room became our headquarters, with legendary bulla sessions and iconic nicknames: Panda, Balma, Cunt, Chudri, Babu, Bitch (yeah, that‚Äôs me). We explored Kanpur on cycles‚ÄîGanga Barrage, ISCKON‚Äîbut birthdays were the real events. We‚Äôd group them together, book a fancy place for dinner, and skip the GPLs‚Ä¶ well, except thatfirstGPL of Prabal‚Äîit was historic.",
      "First-year memories? The Fresher‚Äôs dance, my first time ever on stage‚Äîand now I can say, thanks to KOS,I can dance!All-nighters of practice, and it paid off.",
      "Second year came with a slap of reality: we learnt to do weighted averages ‚ÄìCPI calculationand the realization that personality alone doesn‚Äôt land you interviews. Still, I dove headfirst into campus life: councils, elections, fests. I ran for Mess Sec and lost by 14 votes. That loss taught me more than any win ever could. I still remember my soapbox‚Äîshaky hands, cracking voice‚Äîbut I powered through. That was a turning point.",
      "Eventually, I became Accounts Secretary, then Acting President for a while. Blew 2L (smartly) on hall development. Okay,maybesome futuristic purchases too. But our HEC was driven by one goal: leave the hall better than we found it. We Nawabs always lived up to our legacy, and when in GC, ‚Äúsher ne dahad di tab hil pade pahad bhi.‚Äù We stacked achievements one by one, crushing other pools.",
      "But MTH? Still not my cup of tea. Skipped quizzes, ghosted classes, and finally‚Äîboom‚Äîan F in DC. My worst SPI: 5. Intern season came next. CPI was mid, got just one interview in Phase 1, bombed it. That hit hard. So, I switched gears.",
      "Sem 5 & 6‚Äî65 credits, brutal. But I grinded. Studied. Leetcoded. Refined my resume. 8 AM to 11 PM in the library became my routine. Got rejection after rejection in interview shortlists, but kept going. Then cameDay 1 of placements. Three interviews. One offer.",
      "Mastercard SDE.",
      "After Round 1, I thought I was done. But I stayed confident and answered anyway‚Äîeven when I knew I was wrong. That honesty? Maybe that‚Äôs what got me through.",
      "And after that? The rush for friends‚Äô placements. Running across campus, arranging rooms, coffee, food‚Äîreal bonds were forged there. Akshat, Chaitanya, Arvind (Tau), Verma‚Äîyou guys are gold.",
      "Whole group got placed.We celebrated in Mussoorie‚Äîscooties, snow, rabdi-gulab jamun. Also, Mahakumbh‚Äîbecausepaap dhone padte hain bhai.üòÇ",
      "Then came the 8th sem. Everyone chilled. But not me. I wanted to change. I joined theAdventure Club‚Äôs conditioning camp. The first few weeks were brutal. But I persisted. From barely 2 rounds to 11 rounds of PE ground. Cakewalk now.",
      "Also picked upSkating,Wall Climbing, and yeah‚Äîfound love.A Geo-informatics intern. Totally unexpected. My friends used to joke,‚ÄòTeri toh bandi ban hi nahi sakti.‚ÄôWell, guess what?",
      "Went on aDodital trek‚Äîa soul-healing journey. Met Jassi and Sneha. In a week, they felt like family.",
      "And then‚Ä¶Techkriti. Thecraziestone. Seedhe Maut. Sonu Nigam. Military gear. Tried rifles. Hosted my cousin. Pure madness.",
      "Now? My acads are solid. Personality‚Äôs evolving. I‚Äôve learned tolet go.I used to overthink, get frustrated, needed approval. Not anymore. No more status updates. Stopped offering advice unless asked. Startedlistening‚Äîto life, to people, to myself.",
      "And yes,my dance moves? Fire.Taught ‚ÄòVartman‚Äô choreo to MTH buddies and Adventure Club for our batch videos. Rizzed it up at Farewell too. üòé The best batch of MTH department. I love all those 67 Kings and Queens! Never had such an awesome group of classmates‚ù£Ô∏è, never willü•π",
      "Swimmingis the latest addiction‚Äîstarted two weeks ago and almost mastered it. Want to learn an instrument next.",
      "Thank you, IIT Kanpur.",
      "For the heartbreaks and the homies. For the fests and the failures. For the mess food and the mess-ups. For turning me into someone I‚Äôm proud of.",

      "In this 2nd edition of As We Leave, Atharva Deshmukh, a Y21 student graduating from the Department of Chemical Engineering, shares a heartfelt journey of survival, growth, and unbreakable bonds. From navigating the chaos of ChemE and the trauma of certain professors to finding warmth and laughter in Hall 2 Wing 6, his story is one of resilience and friendship. With memories built around football, mess talks, late-night bulla sessions, and countless random plans, he shows how IITK gave him more than a degree‚Äîit gave him people, moments, and a version of himself he never knew existed.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hey there!",
      "I am Atharva, some might recognise me through the Game Development Club, others through Team IITK Motorsports, and many know me as that Chemical Engineering guy who somehow survived Nitin Kaistha‚Äôs and Raj Pala‚Äôs Courses.",
      "These 4 years at IITK shaped me in ways I never anticipated. The journey began during the pandemic, like for most of us. We all heard seniors talk about their campus experiences while we were stuck at home, dreaming about when we‚Äôd finally get to experience it ourselves.",
      "When we finally reached campus, the joy was palpable. We behaved like excited freshers ‚Äì taking pictures of everything, exploring every corner, making new friends, and adjusting to hostel life. The transition from online to offline was overwhelming yet exhilarating.",
      "After settling in, I had to decide where to invest my time. Game Development Club and Team IITK Motorsports quickly became more than just activities‚Äîthey became part of who I was at IITK.",
      "Motorsports was a whirlwind. Long nights at the workshop, racing against deadlines, and the thrill of seeing our designs come to life or crash in competitions. It wasn‚Äôt just about the work‚Äîit was about the bond we shared, the chaos, the laughter, and the bittersweet moments. It was short, but it was a ride I‚Äôll never forget.",
      "Joining the Game Development Club felt like finding a hidden gem. While Chemical Engineering drained me, this club gave me a chance to breathe, to laugh, and to create. The late-night coding, the bugs, and the pride of seeing people enjoy our games‚Äîit was magic. It reminded me that, amidst the madness of college, there‚Äôs always space for passion, creativity, and a little chaos. It was one of the best decisions I made.",
      "If clubs helped shape what I wanted to do, Hall-2 Wing-6 shaped who I became. It wasn‚Äôt just a place to sleep between lectures‚Äîit was home. It was a chaotic, beautiful mess of personalities that somehow fit perfectly together. My wingmates became my family, my support system, my daily dose of laughter, and late-night madness ‚Äì they were brothers, therapists, comedians and co-dreamers. Our days were filled with endless inside jokes that no outsider could ever understand, and our nights were legendary. We pulled all-nighters not to study, but to play poker and cards, laughing until our stomachs hurt over ridiculous debates that had no logic involved. Our ‚Äòbulla sessions‚Äô went on till the birds started chirping, covering everything from quantum theories to what ifs about life, love, and of course, our eternal debate on what you‚Äôll do if your wife cheats on you?",
      "Election season 2024 was wild. We argued like seasoned politicians‚Äîvoices raised, egos flaring‚Äîonly to walk it off ten minutes later with ice cream in hand, laughing like nothing ever happened. That‚Äôs just who we were: passionate, opinionated, and always there for each other.",
      "The spontaneous movie plans, the midnight food cravings, the hours spent doing nothing yet feeling everything‚Äîthose are the moments that defined my college life. We dreamed together, failed together, and grew together. Looking back, it‚Äôs not the grades or the courses I remember most‚Äîit‚Äôs the people, the memories, the feeling of belonging. Hall-2 Wing-6 wasn‚Äôt just a corridor of rooms. It was the heart of my IITK experience. We came in as strangers, but left as brothers, tied together by late-night snacks, endless memes, and memories that time won‚Äôt dare to erase.",
      "Let‚Äôs talk about Chemical Engineering ‚Äì especially the classes with Nitin Kaistha and Raj Pala. Honestly, those classes were an emotional rollercoaster. Kaistha Sir‚Äôs expectations felt like climbing a mountain blindfolded, and Pala Sir‚Äôs exams reminded me how little I knew. Every time I thought I had a grip, I found myself buried under more problems. It was exhausting, frustrating, and at times, it felt like I was breaking.",
      "But those tough moments shaped me in ways I couldn‚Äôt have imagined. Sleepless nights, endless group study sessions, and those rare moments when a concept finally clicked ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt just about learning; they were about building resilience, patience, and the strength to keep going even when everything seemed impossible.",
      "Chemical Engineering wasn‚Äôt just about equations and reactions; it taught me how to face fear, break down problems, and keep pushing through the toughest days. I wanted to quit more times than I can count, but those challenges pushed me to dig deeper than I ever thought I could.",
      "Looking back, I‚Äôm strangely grateful for the struggle. Kaistha sir and Pala sir may have tested my limits, but they also showed me that I was stronger than I thought. The lessons I learned go far beyond the classroom, and for that, I‚Äôll always be thankful.",
      "I honestly don‚Äôt think I would have survived Chemical Engineering without Rohit, Shaurya, Rajat, Aryan, and Narottam. They were more than just my friends; they were my anchors. When the pressure of endless assignments, sleepless nights, and overwhelming exams got too much to bear, they were there to hold me up. They made the toughest days bearable with their humour, support, and understanding. We weren‚Äôt just studying together; we were fighting through it together. In moments when I thought I couldn‚Äôt keep going, they gave me the strength to push on. I‚Äôll forever be grateful for them because without them, I would have lost myself somewhere along the way.",
      "Thank you, guys, for everything. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you.",
      "The most significant transformation didn‚Äôt happen through textbooks or in clubs‚Äîit happened in the quiet, everyday moments of living away from home. I learned to take care of myself in ways I never imagined‚Äîdoing my own laundry, figuring out finances, and navigating life on my own. But the real change came from the people I met along the way.",
      "My wingmates were my family in ways I didn‚Äôt realise at first. They came from different states, religions, and backgrounds, and every late-night conversation with them opened my heart and mind to a world I had never known. The friend who fasted during Ramadan showed me a level of discipline and spirituality that I never understood before. The wingmate from a small village taught me what it truly means to fight for your dreams, no matter how impossible they seem. And the wingmate with different political beliefs reminded me that, despite our differences, we can still respect and care for each other.",
      "I came to IITK as a teenager, confused, unsure of who I was or where I was headed. Now, I‚Äôm leaving as someone who has learned to look beyond the surface, to listen with compassion, and to find common ground where I thought there was none. I‚Äôve learned lessons that go beyond what any classroom could teach‚Äîlessons of empathy, resilience, and the importance of connection. I will carry these memories, these lessons, with me for the rest of my life.",
      "The fests were unforgettable! Dancing until dawn at Antaragni, losing ourselves in the music and energy‚Äîit was pure magic. But honestly, it wasn‚Äôt just the fests that made it all memorable. It was the chaos of student life: bunking those dreaded classes because we just couldn‚Äôt care, cheating in exams (and getting caught, obviously ‚Äì I will always be grateful to Rohit for taking the complete blame on himself eventhough it was I who was cheating, Thank you my guy), and then begging that one professor in his office to pass us, even though we all knew we were barely scraping by. We somehow managed to do all the ‚Äòbad‚Äô things, but in the end, those experiences were the ones that felt the most real. It was messy, fun, and completely unforgettable.",
      "And then there were the quieter moments: late-night maggi in the canteen after finishing an assignment, celebrating birthdays, and those GPL moments we‚Äôll laugh about for years. It wasn‚Äôt always perfect, but it was ours. The laughter, the chaos, those will always stay with me always.",
      "As I prepare to step into the professional world for a year or two before pursuing an MBA, most probably, I‚Äôm not just leaving with a degree. I‚Äôm leaving with memories that will stay forever. The nights I cried quietly, the times I felt I couldn‚Äôt go on, the friends who sat beside me without saying a word‚Äîthose moments made me who I am. I failed, I fell, but I was never alone. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll carry with me for the rest of my life.",
      "IITK taught me that growth happens outside your comfort zone ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs presenting your game design to a critical audience, defending your chassis design to seniors, or speaking up during those wing debates when your opinion was in the minority.",
      "To those still on campus: Cherish every moment. Attend that extra lecture, join that club you‚Äôre curious about, have that difficult conversation with your wingmate, annoy that one prof, and most importantly, step outside your room regularly. The real IITK experience isn‚Äôt in the classrooms alone; it‚Äôs in the vibrant ecosystem of people, ideas, and opportunities that surround you.",
      "As I leave, I‚Äôm carrying a piece of IITK with me ‚Äì the friendships, the lessons, the struggles, and the triumphs. My hope is that I‚Äôve left something positive behind, too.",
      "These four years weren‚Äôt just a stopover on the way to a career; they were a transformative journey that reshaped who I am. For that, I‚Äôll be forever grateful.",
      "Thank you, IITK. Thank you, Hall-2 Wing-6. And thank you to everyone who was a part of my story and made this journey unforgettable.",
      "This is Atharva Deshmukh, 210231‚Ä¶ signing off for the last time. From scared steps on Day 1 to tearful goodbyes now, thank you ‚Äì IITK, for being home, for breaking me, building me and giving me memories I‚Äôll hold close for a lifetime.",

      "I‚Äôll start by apologizing to Hrishita, the CGM assigned to me. She has been extremely patient but unfortunately for her while I suck at a lot of things I am especially bad at adhering to Vox deadlines and reminiscing about my past in even a slightly coherent manner. I do not want to exceed this deadline so here I am, writing this in the back of an autorickshaw being driven by a very obviously inebriated driver. They say your life flashes before your eyes on the deathbed, I am hoping a non-trivial probability of me dying in a freak accident will conjure up enough of my college life to make for a decent AWL.",

      "‚ÄúEnter IIT Kanpur, study Math, have fun‚Äù",
      "",
      "‚ÄúEnter IIT Kanpur, study Math, have fun‚Äù was my very vague goal when I was studying for the JEE. People are incredulous when I say Kanpur Math was my top choice. But it was, mostly because I spent my JEE prep days reading As We Leaves instead of grinding reaction mechanisms. Because IIT Kanpur was the college that published As We Leaves, it became the college I daydreamt about. Unfortunately for me, daydreaming does not always work. After JEEA 2021, I was almost certain that I was not going to clear the chemistry cutoff, because I spent my JEE days reading random AWLs instead of Solomon. When your (however vague) goal has a single point of failure, coping becomes difficult. It took me some time to come to terms with my mediocrity and I started paying attention to BITS‚Äô lectures before the kind people at KGP released the answer key. By what I can only call divine intervention, I cleared the sectional cutoff, and my dream was not dead. I knew I could still enter IIT Kanpur, maybe study Math, and maybe have fun. I only filled IIT Kanpur courses in JoSAA, and to maximize fun, I managed to convince my parents to let me fill Kanpur Economics over Kanpur Mechanical.",
      "",
      "",
      "The first semester was weird. I was in my dream college, but I was also in my bedroom for the most part. The semester is a blur, I remember joining random zoom meets where people complained about MTH101 problem sets, or about the number of calls they had to make as Techkriti JEs. I was in so many Whatsapp groups that I do not recall what I said that made the Election Commission write me up. I also really wanted a branch change so I remember missing late night bulla sessions so that I could attend 8 am ENG124 lectures (still got a very low participation score but thats life). The semester results were underwhelming, and I cried myself to sleep for like a week. Covid waned and we were called ‚Äúback‚Äù. I came to the campus late due to vaccination delays, and ended up missing the inaugural Antaragni. Regardless, I have very fond memories of the second semester. Got used to the freedom that was afforded by the campus, pulled a lot of ‚Äúplanned all-nighters‚Äù that Shivani still teases me about, got reprimanded by the SiS twice for sneaking to the OAT rooftop, snuck into random weddings with friends and took looong walks. I had my friends, I had my trusty (not) cycle, and I had 1005 acres to explore. And explore I did. I joined Vox, met some really cool people who shaped my college experience in no small way. I joined Vision (RIP) and met fellow nerds, and I met my e-homies who remain my closest friends. By some fluke, I also got a branch change into Math. My plan was so back on track.",
      "",
      "",
      "After feeling really good about myself for getting into MTH for the first couple of weeks, I started working towards the ‚ÄúHave fun‚Äù goal. I joined the Programming Club, did more work with Vox, and volunteered with the SPO for no reason. I‚Äôll always remember my PClub interview. I was asked to prove that I will not scam my way to a ratification and my dumb response was to tell them that I am usually very punctual. They laughed me out of the room, and I spent the next few days ranting about that experience to my friends. They finally decided to take me in, and I will always be grateful to them. I also applied to become the Coordinator, and filled my presentation with a lot of XKCD memes, and it sort of worked out. There is a lesson in there. The highlight, however, was InterIIT. Blasting music from the Arab Spring in the PClub room while waiting for my code to error out was a character building experience that I‚Äôll forever cherish. I also got my first taste of glorious Kanpur winters during my second year. Cycling from H12 to H3 in dense fog with a non zero chance of getting mauled by Nilgai only to watch my code fail is probably what made me a semi-decent programmer. I had the same set of friends, and we engaged in progressively dangerous tomfoolery. I cannot write about a lot of things we did, but real ones know. I had begun planning my days around my friends ‚Äì and was almost reliant on them for most things. Again, this is not immediately relevant. Like any sane person, I also prepared for internships. But unlike most sane people, my preparation ‚Äústrategy‚Äù was aping my more disciplined friends and refusing to look at answers shared in the many Whatsapp groups that had re-emerged from the ashes. Predictably, it did not go very well for me and had it not been for my not-too-bad CPI I am reasonably sure I‚Äôd still be unemployed. Thanks Prof. Saurabh I guess.",

      "My third year started on a dull note after I was voted out of my wing before flunking most placement tests and failing to get into the company I had based my entire self worth on. Instead of talking to people, I stopped interacting with them, stopped studying, and started spending all my time locked in my room. For someone who planned his whole day around meeting people, this was very obviously detrimental. I have cried to more comedy films in the fifth semester than I am comfortable admitting. Predictably, my test scores (another thing I based most of my self esteem on) started dipping, I started skipping classes and fell prey to the practice of lamenting about life without doing anything to change it. I did not sleep because I had nothing fun to wake up to. Then InterIIT 12 was announced, and I suddenly had something to look forward to. Had I not taken part in InterIIT, I am sure my sorry state would have continued. Spending nights in DJAC, working with my absolute boys amidst all the banter saved me. I still stayed up nights, but instead of ugly-crying to Silicon Valley I was trying to gaslight LLMs. Madras was my first ‚Äúcollege trip‚Äù, and while I hate Chennai auto wallahs with a passion I had the time of my life. I loved spending hours roaming the city all by myself ‚Äì eating shitty ramen and overpaying for autos. It was a revelation ‚Äì I was actually having fun without other people. The experience changed me, I decided to curtail my over-reliance on other people, and tried being more open to new friends. I do not remember much of the sixth semester apart from that I lost one of my closest friendships to what I can only call a misunderstanding. My academics were back on track, and I was actually looking forward to spending three months in Bengaluru. And save for a couple of glitches, Bengaluru was fun. 10/10 will recommend. No life lessons here, but maybe do not walk on empty streets inebriated.",
      "",
      "",
      "Like most politically dispensable people I was sent to Hall 9, and while I hated the first few weeks here I eventually came to terms with it. I wanted to paint the walls of my room for character but I haven‚Äôt gotten to that yet. I am guessing they will remain bare. I received a return offer from GS, and became a religious listener of PCRC. I also worked hard towards maximizing fun ‚Äì doing a lot of things for the sake of doing things. I took the CAT, worked on a Physics problem, and became a niche twitter microcelebrity. I also made new friends, and sampled all that Kanpur had to offer with them. Academically, I have never done better. Socially, my life has enough variety to be exciting, and enough routine to not freak me out. I have some semblance of clarity with respect to my career, and I am grateful for my friends. Thanks to the nice folks in the Gymkhana, I also have a lot of pictures in sunglasses and shorts so I think I‚Äôll not run out of LinkedIn thirst trap ammo anytime soon. When I look back and reflect upon my time here, I can only thank God for making sure most of my random decisions (like choosing MTH over EE/SDS during branch change, or dropping an HSS in the 4th sem because I wanted to study 641) did not come back to bite me in the nether regions. Because As We Leaves were the reason I chose this place, I tried finetuning the first few semesters to make them more AWL-able and failed miserably. It was only when I decided to take myself less seriously and allowing for randomness in plans that I started having fun. And having fun was my one true goal. So yes, I think most things worked out, and I have very few regrets. You maybe wondering what is the point of this AWL, because I have not dropped any gyaan ‚Äì and that is because I do not think dispensing gyaan is useful. People have different experiences, and people make different choices. I have simply outlined my experiences and choices. Most of my choices work out, and that has been good enough for me. If some 16 year old reads this and decides to come to IITK, my only advice will be to grind Chemistry instead of spending time on the internet. Stories like mine are only fun when they work out.",
      "I have not yet processed the idea of leaving this place ‚Äì and I do not know what I‚Äôll do once I become a bonafide member of the working class. I have experienced what it is like to wake up with nothing fun to look up to, and it has been miserable. Maybe the only real goal worth chasing is to wake up every day looking forward to something. I did that here. And that, I think, is success enough. 210802 Signing Off.",

      "Join us for the fourth part of this series, as we sit down with Professor Dootika Vats from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. In this insightful interview, Professor Vats reflects on her academic journey, the life lessons she would share with her 20-year-old self, and her hobbies, from cooking to her love for cinema. She opens up about her favourite spots on campus, her passion for teaching, and the deep connection she feels with her students. An all time foodie, she also shares her culinary indulgences and her dream dinner companions. Read on to discover her inspiring philosophy, academic insights, and much more!",
      "",
      "I‚Äôd probably be jobless, homeless somewhere. If I were not a faculty member, I would probably be doing some corporate job in management-type situations. Not that I would have enjoyed it a lot. I would have just been doing that because I would have turned my brain off and said I would just do what people do. I chose this profession because I gave it some thought. If I were to choose a career at this point, though, I would be a terrible film writer, a horrible one. If you asked me when I was 11 or 12, I would be a cricketer. So, the answer is very different based on when I would decide.",
      "I would first tell my 20-year-old self to stop being so enthusiastic about everything in life and that bad things will happen to you. Don‚Äôt be so overly optimistic all the time. I‚Äôm still very positive, but I would probably just let my 20-year-old self know it will be challenging. So just be prepared for a little bit for what you know life has prepared for the future and that not everything can be solved with a positive attitude. Like kimannat mangne se, shiddat karne se, puja karne se aapko kuch milta nahi, aapko kaam bhi karna padta hai,vaise positive attitude rakhne se kuch milta nahi, aapko uske liye kuch karna padta hai.",
      "I used to love cricket when I was growing up, but unfortunately, for cricket, we needed more people, and boys and girls didn‚Äôt play together at that time. I find it so amazing to see young children, boys, and girls playing together these days. But actually, I‚Äôve never played as much; I initially liked to play TT a lot, but nowadays, in the evenings and during the day, I have to work. I have also played tennis, especially during those 2 years of COVID.",
      "I also read as much as possible.¬† I love cinema and world cinema, so I love watching movies in theatres.¬† I love creating movies. I have a movie recommendations tab on my homepage, and I encourage all students to email me new recommendations. Whatever language you want, I can watch it. I like to cook when I have time. I sing horribly, but I like to sing in the confines of my house.",
      "Office and my home. Honestly, I don‚Äôt hang out much on campus because most places are crowded with students. I want a sober, nice, and quiet place. Sometimes, on the weekends, I sit outside CCD, go with a piece of paper or my iPad, and read something. Otherwise, favourite spot? It‚Äôs the tennis lawn.",
      "I am what you call a food snob. I am a very high-maintenance person when it comes to food. If I say I like pizza, people assume it‚Äôs Dominos. But it‚Äôs not Dominos. If you talk about a particular country, then it‚Äôs Italy. Italian food is the best food. I will not hear any arguments against it. Among Indian cuisines, I like Mughlai food a lot, and since I am a non-vegetarian, I eat everything that moves. I love Lucknowi Chicken biryani. I also love Chinese, Mexican, and Korean food a lot. I also love cooking, but I don‚Äôt get much time nowadays. On campus, there used to be a kathi roll shop. The guys moved somewhere outside now, and the rolls aren‚Äôt that good anymore.",
      "Oh, this one is tough because I hear something new and feel like this is campus lingo, but it turns out it is just something that this generation says, and it is not really specific to this campus. During my first year here, I was introduced to many lingos, and I know there‚Äôs something called Batti, as well as informal names of different departments. Once, I learned BT because somebody said ‚ÄúBT hui‚Äù. I kept wondering what that person meant because I wanted to act like a cool professor.",
      "‚ÄúMaster of None‚Äù.¬† I would like that.",
      "I come from an academic family. So, it‚Äôs sort of by default. But I knew I wanted to study more, for as long as possible. Again, coming from an academic family, doing a master‚Äôs or PhD was natural. I was a mediocre student all my life in the sense that I never studied and always got medium marks in high school and undergrad.¬† Then, in my master‚Äôs, I felt that I should become a bit more serious, and during my PhD, I felt that if I was doing it seriously, then I could do it.",
      "And then I also realised that I have some other life skills that, in general, academic people don‚Äôt have. I can read a room. I can have conversations with people. I can sell my work better because I know how to speak, talk, or make a story. So, I realised I had some soft skills that I could use, and I just had to work a little harder academically. But I had it in me. So I was like, oh, this seems fun, and I can do whatever I want. And be my own boss. I get to travel the world. I am also passionate and slowly became more passionate about the topics I was reading about. Yeah, so it was like a natural, organic way where I grew into the idea of being an academic. And I also like teaching a lot. I enjoy interacting with young people.",
      "A great perk of this job that I‚Äôve found out now, having been at the job for a few years, is that I‚Äôm turning older. But your kids remain the same age. I mean, not you, but the concept of a student will always be that. And that‚Äôs quite interesting because, you know, I‚Äôll always have access to what the youth is thinking, how they are feeling, what language they speak. They no longer say ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô; they say ‚Äòsus‚Äô. You know, so you have to keep in touch with that young energy. And it‚Äôs a great, great plus to have.",
      "I am also from IIT Kanpur. I grew up here, so I have seen massive changes since I was a kid. There is also a lot more construction on the campus now. I don‚Äôt think the campus has changed as much as my understanding of the campus has changed. As somebody coming from the American educational system where all majors are treated equally, at least in spirit, I was very against the idea of hierarchy among the departments. I thought there were different students with different capabilities. I don‚Äôt mean any offence, but slowly, what I‚Äôve come to realise is that from the point of view of an instructor teaching a course, there is a reason that these preconceptions exist. I don‚Äôt believe in them. Though, I understand that they exist and why they exist. But this is not just limited to the IIT Kanpur. It‚Äôs a country-wide issue. I would love for majors and opportunities to be much more equitable. But sadly, we‚Äôre very far away.",
      "I travel a lot. I went to Mexico for the first time last month, and it was very nice. I‚Äôve been to Finland also. We went up to the mountains at midnight, saw the Northern Lights, and trekked through the snow. I went to China in December of 2019, which was very interesting. I was in Hangzhou for a conference. It‚Äôs a fantastic city, a fantastic place, and it has great food again. Then I came back and went to London before returning. That was when I was accused of spreading COVID because I went to so many places. In December 2019, I went to 10 places.",
      "I strongly desire to travel, and Vietnam is at the top of my list. The country‚Äôs vibrant culture and amazing food are incredibly appealing. What excites me even more is the French influence on Vietnamese cuisine, a legacy of their colonial history, which I find fascinating and can‚Äôt wait to experience. Korea is another destination I‚Äôm eager to visit, and the motivation is purely for the food. I‚Äôd love to dive into the country‚Äôs culinary delights‚Äîjust to eat and savour everything!",
      "So, this past summer, I was in the US for about a month. A few of my former students flew to where I was just to meet me. And we hung out; we went for a trek, went to a brewery, had a couple of beers, and just hung out with them. And I found that very, very rewarding. Just the idea that they found it valuable and interesting to dedicate some time off from work, fly to the city I‚Äôm in, and hang out with me. I was bowled over by the level of investment they‚Äôve had in the time we have together. And it‚Äôs very rewarding for me to continue to invest in the students who work with me in such a way. I reinforce the feeling that the experience that they‚Äôve had working with me has meant something.",
      "The challenge is that every year, students graduate. Students don‚Äôt realise that the faculty has to say goodbye to them every year. In the beginning, we emotionally connect with not every student but a couple of students in the classroom who might have reached out to us. Then, some students are working with us on projects, etc. We‚Äôre interacting with them. We‚Äôre sometimes getting to know their family problems. We‚Äôre sometimes getting to know their life goals and struggles‚Äîhelping them make decisions, investing in their future, and writing letters of recommendation. Beyond all the technical ways we contribute, these personal connections matter. Students often leave, and if the relationship is good, they value it. But what students might not realise is that they mean a lot to us while they‚Äôre here. They move on, and we return to square one with a new student. This cycle repeats every year. It can be emotionally draining at times. I have this theory‚Äîif I reflect on the faculty I had as an undergrad, many seemed jaded and cynical, keeping their distance from students. I suspect I might become that person in 5-10 years, or at most in 20. One can manage only so much of this emotional cycle while maintaining one‚Äôs mental well-being. How much can we give? We invest. You come. You go. Occasionally, a few students will look back and acknowledge the effort. A few will genuinely value it.",
      "Every faculty member is different; not everyone feels the way I do. But for me, the hardest part is when students leave‚Äîespecially those I work with closely. Meeting them for two hours every week, building that relationship, and then seeing them move on to, hopefully, a great future they‚Äôve worked hard to achieve‚Äîit‚Äôs both fulfilling and challenging.",
      "I think many professors were probably just average students. In my opinion, the idea that you need Einstein-level brilliance or obsessive dedication to become a professor is entirely false. To be on this side of the table, you need perseverance, a lot of patience, and perhaps not being particularly good at‚Äîor interested in‚Äîother things that are often more appealing. Sure, there‚Äôs a subset of exceptionally bright professors, but I can confidently say that most students here are likely smarter than me. So, this notion that being a faculty member requires exceptional genius or Curie-like dedication is simply not true. What other myths are there? That we‚Äôre fun people. Some of us are, but our idea of fun is different. That‚Äôs partly because of age. Your definition of fun now will probably change when you‚Äôre older, too. Think about your parents‚Äîsome are fun people, but their idea of fun is different. It‚Äôs just a matter of perspective.",
      "Pankaj udhas ke Gaane Lagao aur Suno, that‚Äôs also fun for a lot of people.",
      "I think many faculty possess a deep sense of empathetic understanding that students often don‚Äôt recognise. This empathy comes not only from our own life experiences but also from years of working with students. The challenges and worries you face aren‚Äôt new to us‚Äîlast year, there were likely four other students with similar concerns. If you can overcome the initial intimidation or fear of approaching faculty, you might find this empathy accessible. Of course, not every faculty member is the same, but many of us are open and willing to connect in this way.",
      "If I could have dinner with three people, it would be Irrfan Khan, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Piku. Although, if we can squeeze in an extra chair, Jane Austen would be a lovely addition, too!",
      "Irrfan Khan‚Äôs death hit me hard. I started genuinely appreciating his brilliance later in life, and by then, he was gone. The magic of watching his films for the first time can‚Äôt be recreated now, and knowing there won‚Äôt be new ones feels heartbreaking. Harmanpreet Kaur intrigues me. She‚Äôs around my age, chose a different path, and is now the Indian cricket captain. I admire her drive but sometimes question her attitude. I‚Äôd love to understand her better over a conversation. Piku is an authentic character‚Äîprobably the most accurate portrayal of an independent, working woman in her late 20s or early 30s I‚Äôve ever seen in Hindi cinema. She reminds me of myself and many of my friends at that stage. I‚Äôd love to chat with her, though I‚Äôd have to catch up on Satyajit Ray films beforehand to avoid her judgment! And Jane Austen, of course, would add elegance, wit, and timeless insights to the table‚Äîhow could I not invite her?",
      "I attended, listened, and understood the concepts in most classes during college, except for the morning ones. But I never did homework. In our college, there was no homework. There were only two exams ‚Äì midterm (December) and final (April/May). I used to study only during those two weeks. But my approach was straightforward ‚Äì understanding the concept was important. Until I understood, my mind would itch. But once I understood, I felt no need to study further.",
      "I wasn‚Äôt a hardworking student, though I cared about learning. I wish I had worked harder during my undergrad. I hadn‚Äôt learned how to work hard back then. This all changed when I started my master‚Äôs in mathematics in the US. I struggled a lot and was close to failing three classes. For the first time, I felt challenged in the classroom and didn‚Äôt know how to handle it. I didn‚Äôt have the habit of working hard or an interest in abstract maths. Finally, I withdrew from all my courses and decided I didn‚Äôt want to do this; I wanted to do something else.",
      "Then, I took CS and statistics courses, which I had never studied before. Statistics made sense because I could clearly see how to move from one step to the next. After months of struggling with maths, this gave me confidence. I felt that this could be done. However, I realised I was quite behind in statistics because other people were much more experienced.",
      "That‚Äôs when I actually started working hard. I took a loan for my master‚Äôs, worked two or three on-campus jobs, and had to complete courses‚Äîin just three semesters instead of four. So, I started working explosively. My mother still says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre working from your own will,‚Äù because as a child, I was never like this. But that phase taught me how to work hard, something I had never done before.",
      "See, I am unique. It could be a mix of different characters. A little tinge of Parineeti Chopra from Hasee Toh Phasee. Then, a touch of Rani Mukherjee from Dil Bole Hadippa. And 20% essence of Piku, but not too much‚Äîjust a little. And yes, Fleabag, maybe 5%. So, it‚Äôs like this mixture of all these characters combined somehow.",
      "There are a few guiding principles I follow. One is the idea of Karam karo, phal ki chinta mat karo, but in a different sense. I focus on doing the work without worrying about whether I‚Äôm good enough. I leave the evaluation to others and don‚Äôt stop myself from trying because I think I might fail. That‚Äôs how I approach my work life.",
      "In my personal life, I believe in maintaining a positive attitude‚Äî this can happen. Not blindly optimistic like our win is guaranteed, but rooted in the belief that good things can happen if you work honestly towards them.",
      "Another principle is that money isn‚Äôt a driving factor in most decisions‚Äîprobably because I have enough to be comfortable. I focus on maximising joy and doing things that genuinely bring me happiness. That‚Äôs what matters most to me.",
      "I‚Äôm generally very impressed with the student body. Collectively, students are articulate, well-positioned, and principled. At the same time, there‚Äôs also a touch of mischievous, unprincipled behaviour, which honestly leaves me bewildered at times. Since this is a candid conversation, I‚Äôll say it outright‚Äîwhy PDA? Why public displays of affection? From what I understand, you have rooms, don‚Äôt you? Sometimes, it gets so uncomfortable that I can‚Äôt even sit in the CCD. While showing affection is okay, other things should perhaps remain private. That‚Äôs something I find rather alarming.",
      "Beyond this, I‚Äôve noticed how much stress students take about their future, as if every step they take will define their entire career. This mindset stems from the constant reinforcement over the years‚Äîthe idea that excelling in the 10th and 12th grades, or JEE, guarantees a successful life. I find this perspective quite puzzling because I was never like that. I was much more carefree, so it‚Äôs hard for me to understand why students burden themselves so much.",
      "I‚Äôve had so many positive interactions with students over the years and had the privilege of mentoring quite a few. In the last batch of MSc students who graduated in June, I taught them two brand-new courses‚ÄîData Science Lab and Statistical Computing. These were entirely new courses, so I was learning and figuring things out alongside them. It was a fascinating journey for all of us. When they graduated, something happened during the event that moved me so profoundly that I said, ‚ÄúChalo shaam ko sab ghar aajao.‚Äù And just like that, there were 40 students in my tiny house! It was such a joyful experience, watching their journey from not knowing how to sit at a computer or what a URL box is to now landing data science jobs at reputed companies. For them, it was also a very special memory; for me, it‚Äôs one I‚Äôll always cherish. Teaching those courses was incredibly challenging since it was my first time with that content, but seeing how far that gang of 40 came made it all worth it. It‚Äôs a memory I‚Äôll hold close to my heart.",
      "One of the most underappreciated skills is learning to be a responsible citizen. Unlike questions and answers, which are right or wrong‚Äîlife outside doesn‚Äôt work that way.In the humanities, there‚Äôs no absolute right or wrong, only well-articulated or less well-articulated answers. Similarly, real-life issues require empathetic understanding‚Äîconsidering where someone comes from and why they make certain decisions. Understanding that there is a right way and a wrong way, but it also depends on whose shoes you are wearing. Life is full of grey areas, and we need to embrace that nuance.",
      "I didn‚Äôt go to an IIT. I was thankful and never had that experience, but I had to suffer through spending time with many IIT graduates during my master‚Äôs and PhDs. My first advice is that we all should be very proud alumni of the institutes that have shaped and formed our formative years but don‚Äôt stay with that attitude once you leave this place. You should try to get away from this chip on the shoulder or the feeling of pride that I am better than people because there are different people and journeys.",
      "Another thing is that students, mainly when they come closer to graduation, start thinking that their next decision will shape their entire life. It‚Äôs a long journey. I am 34. I have friends with whom I went to undergrad and master‚Äôs and who are adapting their careers even now. The next thing you do should increase your life value in some way in either happiness, finance, or pride. But it need not be the final target of your life.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the lives of your professors beyond the lecture halls and labs? Were they just like us as students? What paths might they have taken if not for academia?",
      "Vox is back with Season 2 ofCandid Conversations with Professors @IITK, where our professors share their journeys, interests, and unfiltered insights into life at IITK and beyond.",
      "Join us in the 3rd part of this season, with Professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, as we explore his thoughts on the campus culture and college times, his favourite culinary indulgences, his love for the sea, and his dream dinner companions. We see how his father, as an agricultural scientist inspired him to get into academia and become a professor. In the interview, he discusses the joys of teaching, the challenges of fostering innovation in India, and the simple philosophy of living without regrets, among many other things. Read on for more!",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "When I have free time, I like to watch the most nonsensical movies and serials like Crime Patrol, something I can watch and forget‚Äîjust to be distracted for an hour.",
      "Any favourite spot you have on campus?",
      "My office. If you track my location, you‚Äôll only find me in my apartment and my office, and earlier at SIIC, I don‚Äôt go anywhere; I don‚Äôt venture on campus.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "All the departments‚Äô nicknames, from Basbey to Hathora to Batti and many more, and Tempo High Hai. Some of the campus lingos infused are from outside Kanpur, such as bakaiti, etc. I recently learned from an Instagram post that it is Kanpur lingo.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I like the sea, so I would love to travel to some remote islands in Indonesia or the Maldives or Mauritius, and other places. And if I have company, then perhaps Antarctica. I don‚Äôt enjoy cities for traveling purposes.¬† But you know, with time, I have become a little less agile. So, strenuous treks nowadays, for more than a day, are a challenge for me, but in a day, if you ask me to make a 20-kilometer round trip, I‚Äôll happily do it.",
      "Who is the character/personality you most resemble?",
      "One obvious person is my father; I‚Äôm a carbon copy of my father, and he was exceptionally curious. Just to give you a hint of what he used to do, he was an agricultural scientist. His research area was to develop a strain of rice that would grow in salt or deep water, both of which are bad for the growth of rice. So he did genetics and came up with a breed of rice that could grow up to a foot really fast. He was very excited about describing that to me when I was in 9th or 10th grade. That‚Äôs what shaped my imagination, and I‚Äôm just equally excited about Science. It could just be a trivial question, but if it is a question that has come to my mind, I generally like to go into its depth. I think like him, and I‚Äôm really easy-going and approachable. And I, too, am a foodie, in fact, a big-time foodie.",
      "Apart from that, I may be a little bit of Aamir Khan type. I‚Äôm a perfectionist, but I love to have fun.",
      "What is your favorite food?",
      "Mutton Biryani",
      "What cuisines do you enjoy?",
      "I pretty much enjoy all sorts of cuisine, but I am a little more into food with a good aroma, so I am just in the right place. Awadhi cuisine is perhaps the most aromatic, light cuisine. So I love that. After that, possibly Mediterranean cuisine. I like that. Unlike many people, I am not a huge fan of Italian food.",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive, or fictional, who would they be?",
      "A fictional person would certainly be Professor Shonku. I think none of you know this. He is the creation of Satyajit Ray, the great Bengali scholar, film director, and author. Professor Shonku was the character in his science fiction books. On the one hand, he was intense with Science but completely unorganized, too, and he did crazy stuff that would generally be on the side of the good.",
      "The dead person that I would love to be with would be Mendeleev. Just imagine the power of his imagination that he not only created the periodic table and placed the elements in their places but was also confident in saying that there would be other elements that would be placed here. That‚Äôs the power of logic. I am a huge fan of logic and its application.",
      "The living person whom I would like to watch across the table would be Amitabh Bachchan. Not just because I am a huge fan of his movies because I grew up with his movies, but also because I like his professionalism. He has many negative things about him, which I‚Äôve read, but still, nobody can deny that he is a thoroughbred professional at the age of 82.",
      "What inspired you to get into academia?",
      "As I said, like my father, I was academically good when I was growing up, just like any faculty member here. My father was a very, very brilliant scientist, and he would often engage me in deep scientific discussion, disregarding the fact that I was not mature enough to understand. Some of his excitement just got transmitted. So, I thought that this might be a fun career. I was quite determined to be in academia from Day 0.",
      "If you weren‚Äôt a professor, what would your profession be?",
      "Perhaps a medicine doctor. I think that medicine is also about connecting the dots. Unlike surgery, I make a distinction. So medicine is like patiently listening to patients‚Äô history, then connecting dots to figure out exactly what the limit might be, and then prescribing the medicine. I think that trait is very similar to what we do as bench scientists, where we study phenomena.",
      "What‚Äôs your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "Every night when I go to bed, I should not have any regret that I have done anything wrong on that day. That‚Äôs it.",
      "As a Professor, what are some rewards and challenges that you have experienced?",
      "The reward is love and recognition of people that I have worked with, particularly those who reported to SIIC, the companies that I helped create, which are currently valued at more than 500 crores, and I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll acknowledge.",
      "To do Science in India is a challenge because your imagination goes much ahead of realities because there are way too many hurdles on your way, which are non-scientific; that is the challenge. Otherwise, I guess most faculty members of IIT Kanpur and I have a very good life.",
      "What would you say to your 20-year-old self?",
      "Whatever you are doing, try to be the best in it, whatever it is. If you are trying to learn exercise, try to be the best at it. If you are trying to drive the car, be the best at it. Whatever you do. Another thing that I have learned and realized much later is that fiscal prudence and financial planning are very important. If I were 20 years old again, I would have done much better financial planning today, knowing where things can go wrong.",
      "What is something students do that totally confuses you?",
      "Oh, you‚Äôll not like the answer. The steadfast refusal of students to learn is actually very mind-boggling because IIT Kanpur has some of the smartest kids in the country. Still, they have this attitude that I don‚Äôt want to learn much of the things.",
      "What are the most valuable skills a student can gain from college?",
      "How to get along with people and how to interact with people.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "There was a student from the mechanical department, Btech. He wanted to take my course, but he had no biology background. He had to spend hours with me to learn because I teach an advanced-level subject. He was able to grasp it and then run with it, and then eventually, he‚Äôs doing biomechanics for his PhD. I really enjoyed it.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "Perhaps just one word, ‚Äòtransformation‚Äô, because I am a basic scientist, an absolutely basic fundamental biologist. Still, somewhere along the line, I was made the head of the SIIC, and now I think I have become more of a baniya than a scientist. There, I had to learn, at least, the technology aspect of a very broad domain, from aerospace to biotechnology to tribal technology. That has been a transformation, and that has actually transformed my life.",
      "What are some changes you have seen in IITK throughout your tenure?",
      "Well, IITK, over my tenure, has become increasingly more ambitious regarding research objectives and what it wants to achieve, which is on the positive side. Infrastructure quality has improved but students‚Äô sincerity and honesty, on the other hand, has gone down.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "That we take ourselves too seriously. That‚Äôs not at all true. I tried to explain this to my students. In the classroom, I have a job. My job is to teach and assess whether you have learned what I taught there. Outside the classroom, I am just another person.",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "I was fun-loving, like if we talk about extracurricular activities, I used to be a Boy Scout. My scout group used to participate in national competitions, so I gave a lot of time. I grew up in a small town, so I did not have other kinds of opportunities like, you know, playing tennis or football, and athletically, I was never good. But scouting is something that I enjoyed, and I devoted a lot of time to it. Despite that, I did pretty well academically, but there was a phase during my Bachelor of Science when I was like many of you; academics took a back seat, a serious backseat. But the difference is that I took full responsibility for my mistakes and did not expect to be accommodated despite not doing what I was supposed to do. But after this, I never looked back, I must say.",

Here‚Äôs the first part‚Äîstay tuned for the next parts, featuring some of our other professors, with different stories!",
      "In part 2 of this season, we join Professor Amit Kuber from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, whose journey in life is marked by both passion and perseverance. From hosting impromptu game shows in his school days to becoming a mentor and a role model for his students, his commitment to learning and teaching has remained steadfast. In this interview, he also touches upon his love for music and Pokemon showdown, his affinity to infinity, and his desire to help students beyond the classroom.",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "Studious plus involved in extracurricular activities. I liked arranging game shows. I started this when I was in school. One time when 31stDecember was around the corner, I dug out some old clothes of my father and hosted a KBC-like tournament in our apartment. Even in my college times, students used to participate, and teachers used to be judges; it was fun.",
      "Any favorite spot you have on campus?",
      "One could say my office, I spend a lot of my time here. Spots depend on memories. When I stand on the balcony, I remember my first PhD student, Shantanu. Whenever it rained, we used to watch it from there.",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "I generally do not have much free time. But, I like to practice music, especially when I have company. Pok√©mon Showdown is my hobby. I used to participate in anime society tournaments here but haven‚Äôt gone in the last couple of years.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "People generally try to avoid using them in front of me though I had a couple of students who talked to me in that language. My first-ever student on campus, Harshit, told me a lot of lingos.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "I am not that old to think of my memoir, but it would be ‚ÄòExpinfinity-exploring infinity within‚Äô- Infinity has been a concept that has always fascinated me, and adding ‚Äòexp‚Äô or `exponential‚Äô makes it grow faster.",
      "What are some changes you have seen in IITK throughout your tenure?",
      "The number of students has increased, but the number interested in studies has either remained the same or has declined. Many students from the Y13 and Y14 MTH batches went for higher education. Now that number has gone down to 1 or 2. That change haunts me. I try my best to do something about it.",
      "Also, the number of peacocks has decreased. I used to wake up because of peacocks when I initially came to the campus. Now I can hardly hear them. The size of the forest area has also decreased. The amount of infrastructure has increased, yet due to the large number of students, now there isn‚Äôt enough place to hold exams. The LHC staff is helpful, but the space is inadequate.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I haven‚Äôt thought of that. Even when I was studying abroad, my family supported me for food and accommodation, and I was very conscious about never spending a single pound unnecessarily. But whenever I go to any place, I try to live like the locals. I don‚Äôt like to go on tours. Places have to be explored being with the locals, not like a tourist.",
      "As a Professor, what are some rewards and challenges that you have experienced?",
      "The reward is that people open up. They share their problems & joys. If someone needs me to be present somewhere, I‚Äôm always there. The greatest joy is that I can be of some help, especially to students.",
      "As far as challenges are concerned, investing a lot of time and energy without worrying about consistent output is not encouraged. Also, as a researcher, I can‚Äôt put a tag on myself. In my master‚Äôs, PhD, and postdoc, I didn‚Äôt work only on a single topic. Finding an identity as a mathematician and switching between different roles on a daily basis has also been challenging.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "Recently a fresher told me that several students think that the instructors for large courses only teach while the rest of the work is handled by TAs and office staff. This is a myth since an instructor-in-charge has to work hard on all fronts‚Äìsetting question papers, making seating arrangements, and handling administration, including email communication. They cannot completely rely on their TAs or office staff, since they need to own the responsibility for every mistake committed by any of their teammates!",
      "Students generally need to remember that professors are also humans. They have their own set of challenges and problems, and they are also trying to do something good for the students. Here, the reputation of a professor usually only depends on whether they grade well or not. Now that shouldn‚Äôt be the case. I feel like learning should be given more priority than just grading. The final outcome of a course is not a single letter that you get; it‚Äôs what you learn and the skills you develop in the process. Professors who are trying to be strict, say about grading or discipline in the class, have broader goals in mind. They want to see their students grow in multiple dimensions. Nobody wants to bother students on purpose. Maybe professors don‚Äôt communicate enough about what they are trying to achieve, but through proper communication, I feel that this problem can be resolved.",
      "Students have a lot of expectations. If you get zero marks and you‚Äôre expecting that I should pass you just because there are other people doing so, that is not fair. Some standards should be maintained. Sometimes we need to become a stone-hearted person while making hard decisions because students only learn through experience. Achievements should be celebrated, and poor performance needs to have repercussions in your life. We can‚Äôt all be too generous and spread positivity through marks!",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive or fictional, who would they be?",
      "I have watched a lot of television as well as movies. Ash Ketchum, who was the protagonist of Pokemon, would be the first. I wasn‚Äôt too young when I started watching it, but I followed it for 25 years. Ash likes to help people and is faithful, loyal and caring about his companions.",
      "I am also a big fan of Harry Potter, for he embodies the principle that despite loss, you need to stay on the path of truth. Even though they are fictional characters, I idealized them to some extent because of their qualities.",
      "Finally, Alexandre Grothendieck‚Äìthe greatest mathematician of the 20th century‚Äìwho basically lived mathematics.¬† My friend, Sayantan and I are also involved in a long-term project of translating his autobiography into English.",
      "What‚Äôs your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "‚ÄúIrrespective of your circumstances, do your duty as you ought to!‚Äù",
      "Just push on, no matter what is happening. Asha Bhosle shared this philosophy several times in her interviews. I‚Äôve also seen her in person. Her life was tragic, but she always says that whenever she stepped inside a studio, all her worries were outside, and only her voice was inside.¬† I try to follow that to the maximum extent possible.",
      "What is something students do that totally confuses you?",
      "There are so many things. The latest one would be students listening to seniors even if their advice contradicts that of instructors. That definitely confuses me.",
      "Also, I feel like the younger generation is not willing to commit to whatever aspect of life. Fear of commitment is something I feel is a big issue. I‚Äôll tell you one story. I was watching Taskmaster- they usually have some team tasks. Here, 2 teammates were given 2 different letters of instruction, and they did not know what the other one got. One person was told to fill up a bathtub with as many objects as possible, whereas the other person was told to wrap the same bathtub. From the older team, one person actually finished filling up the bathtub with objects and then helped the other one wrap it. On the other hand, members of the young team kept obstructing each other. There was no coordination or synergy, and they did not think about the bigger picture. I went for a session organized by the Counseling service. One girl asked me how she should talk to her peers from the class? I think she was a PhD student. And she told me that even if she asks a simple question to the person sitting next to her, they are not willing to answer because they look at her as a competitor.Not everything is about competition, right?¬† You are living on campus. This is a residential campus, which means you have to live as a family. But people don‚Äôt do that. And there is very little cooperation. Everybody is living in fear. And that fear can be of the unknown. That can be fear of missing out, which you call FOMO. Why not make a choice and have the courage to face problems on the chosen path? If you realise that you made a bad choice, then you go back to a fork and make a different choice. People are willing to keep all the options open until the last moment possible and not commit. Yeah, it‚Äôs a simple commitment. I wasn‚Äôt talking about commitment in the context of relationships, but that‚Äôs also an issue!",
      "In the past, if you had an uncle working in a bank and he helped you to get a job in the bank, then you could be employed there until retirement. I‚Äôm not suggesting that. But if it gives you time to do something else, pursue a hobby, then that‚Äôs not a bad option. There are many singers and music directors who survived that way. For example, a lot of Marathi people like Shrinivas Khale and Mangesh Padgaonkar used to do some menial jobs, but those jobs gave them the opportunity as well as financial stability to pursue alternate careers. The best job is one where you are doing something you like, and somebody‚Äôs paying you for that.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "There are many.¬† One day, we had some elective course presentations going on until 2:00 AM. At that time, I got a call from two of my students who were working with me then. They said they were really excited because they found something new and -wanted to meet immediately. I asked them to come, and we discussed until morning. The residential campus has its perks, and sometimes the boundaries of time just vanish.",
      "Any advice for the student body?",
      "Be a good human. Things that you earn are not necessarily in terms of comfort, luxury or money; in the long term, those things don‚Äôt matter.",

Here‚Äôs the first part‚Äîstay tuned for the next parts, featuring some of our other professors, with different stories!",
      "In part 1 of this season, we sit down with Professor M.K. Harbola to dive into his world outside academia. From his unique approach to teaching quantum mechanics to his passion for jogging, reading, and daily exercise, Professor Harbola shared a glimpse of his multifaceted personality. Reflecting on the evolution of his teaching philosophy, the joy of connecting with students, and the challenge of being a ‚Äútough grader‚Äù with a purpose, he offers candid thoughts and refreshing insights into the experiences that shape his journey.",
      "What character or person does your personality resemble most, if any?",
      "You should tell me.I don‚Äôt analyse my personality. Because I‚Äôm still evolving. I keep changing as a person, a researcher and as an educationist. So it‚Äôs very difficult to say. You will also realise as you grow older that you are evolving continuously. You do not resemble somebody all the time.",
      "If you could have dinner with any three people, dead, alive or fictional, who would they be?",
      "I don‚Äôt have any preferences, and I don‚Äôt believe it would have been good only if a specific person came. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll go out with Einstein; he will give me knowledge and all. Knowledge I‚Äôll collect anywhere. It should be a fun interaction. So it could be anybody, certainly not a criminal or gunda, but anybody nice to talk to because every person gives you joy, no matter what. At your age, you think it would be fun only if you go with certain people. But it is not like that. The person accompanying doesn‚Äôt matter. If you have a wide range of topics to talk about, you can enjoy with anybody. It‚Äôs up to you what you extract out of the conversation.",
      "What are some hobbies and activities that you enjoy in your free time?",
      "I jog every day, swim every day, go to gym every day, and read a lot.",
      "What do you like reading?",
      "A lot of things, as long as it is creative. Right now, I am reading ‚ÄúCode Dependent‚Äù; it‚Äôs about how AI affects life and its negative and positive shades. I also read the book ‚ÄúInvention of Surgery‚Äù, so that‚Äôs a wide range of reading material. In the fictional genre, I read a lot of Hindi literature.",
      "What inspired you to get into academia?",
      "It is interaction with people; It helps you grow;¬† and there are many more things. Number one is creating knowledge, and number two is sharing it and the joy of doing it. So, young students may swear a lot and tell many things about me, like a tough grader and all, but I enjoy interacting with them. What matters to me is that some student looks back after a few years and says that he gave us good stuff; he gave us a different perspective.",
      "So in your courses, like quantum mechanics, students find it difficult when they‚Äôve just arrived after giving jee. What do you have to say about that?",
      "So, when the quantum mechanics course was first introduced, I taught it for the first time. It would have been very easy for me and the students if I had gone there and started the Schrodinger equation and solved some problems with it, and that way, I would have finished it. However, students would not get anything from that and would have no perspective. So, I made a very unique course. I did not touch any elaborate equations for about half the course. I tried to show them different phenomena, what they are, and how a new theory is needed to understand it all. So their expectation should be to come to a place where they can learn a lot. In doing so they will face new challenges, and they‚Äôll also have to put in a lot of work. But, their expectation is that this is a physics course and it is approached with a JEE style of problem-solving.",
      "So the challenge is how do you get that across to the students? What is being taught is the way real things happen, and this is what is useful, and this is what you have to work for. So first, I tried to tell students that the world is quantum mechanical, not classical. I got them to write essays on how classical physics is a good approximation to quantum mechanics. After doing all this, I held a presentation of their essays in L20, spending 4-5 hours in the evening. I arranged snacks for everyone. But nobody will tell you this part. After doing so much, students don‚Äôt appreciate it. They only say that I am a tough grader. My teaching was not hard; it was different.",
      "I‚Äôll give you a similarity. Based on gender or other differences, people are treated as inferior. But in reality, they are just different, not superior or inferior. And you can learn from each other. Similarly, my courses are different because they give you a new perspective. I work really hard for it. They look tough because students are not willing to accept the difference. Nobody talks about the good aspects.",
      "The second time I taught this course, I got a play organised. That play was attended by 1000 people. I had to work a lot for that and spend a good amount of the institute‚Äôs money. I got the play translated into Hindi. This was the first-ever staging of the play in Hindi. But students didn‚Äôt see the play as something extraordinary, nor did they appreciate that they were in such a course. This disappoints me.¬† But I am willing to take on the challenge and will continue working this way.",
      "When I taught this course for the first time, I worked for 10 months, 7 days a week, 10-14 hours a day, to develop the material for the course. But the response came that I taught a very hard course. Come and sit in the class and see. Nobody will tell you that I gave an A even at 25-30 marks. So, this is very disappointing in the sense that these same people are the leaders of tomorrow. But I‚Äôm not going to get discouraged. Out of them, even if 5 or 10 understand it, it‚Äôs fine.",
      "If you weren‚Äôt a professor, what would your profession be?",
      "Oh, surgeon. You will be interacting with people and doing things. But not an administrator.",
      "Any favourite spot you have on campus?",
      "This campus is so beautiful. On top of the new engineering science building or faculty building, you get a beautiful view. Earlier, I really loved going to the backside of the campus, behind Hall 13 and Hall 10. That used to be a beautiful place, where in winter there used to be vapours coming up and winter birds used to be there. It was a low-lying water area. And I think as students you should go around and see a lot of such things.",
      "Any campus lingos you are aware of?",
      "Many of my fellow students and I learnt a lot of them and gave some new ones when I was a student. A fair number of them are used even now‚Äîsome I don‚Äôt like, like fakka. One is chaapu, which was also used in our time. Baikaati is dadagiri, and someone who did very well is known as baikaat. Another is the maggu and bulla session. These are what were there during our time as well.",
      "Any places that you want to travel to?",
      "I like traveling a lot in India because there is a lot to see. Next, I want to visit Ajanta-Ellora, one place I‚Äôve not been to, or the Meenakshi Temple and Rameshwaram. In the northeast, there is a place I‚Äôve been to near Imphal, Loktak Lake, a freshwater lake. For now, I am exploring India. If I am going abroad, then I‚Äôll go to Southeast Asia. It is culturally much more interesting.",
      "Any common myths about professors that are not true?",
      "It‚Äôs not a myth but a perception that Professors do not have a human side. Students think profs are givers ‚Äì of lectures, tutorials and they just give us grades. They don‚Äôt interact; they do not see us as fellow human beings, but if they interact, they will find we are also human beings; we have worked hard, we have gone through a lot of things, maybe what you will see as you grow; that‚Äôs why this is a residential campus so that you grow up as a citizen. The human aspect of students is gone because, in the years prior to coming here, they were only doing problem-solving.",
      "Teaching and Grading is just one part; the other part is the human aspect. It‚Äôs a place with an environment; everybody is part of it, and we professors, students, and staff are all part of it. It will make things much better if we all see that. Otherwise, I can just come and teach; students will study, I will give grades, and they will swear, that‚Äôs it.",
      "What would you say to your 20-year-old self?",
      "What is interesting is what he would tell me. He would say to keep going the same way but reduce the times you‚Äôve made a mess of things. I‚Äôll tell him this: Live the way you should live and enjoy. The rest is not in your control.",
      "Now, he would tell me‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve grown up well.",
      "Maybe I‚Äôll ask him- Have I been fair to you? Have I been how you thought I would be?",
      "How were you as a student?",
      "I was like any other student. I had fun. I made fun of profs, I imitated them, but I also talked to them. You should have fun at your age, but everything has an upper limit. I did everything, even bunked classes, but within a limit. I have bunked class and gone to see movies, too.",
      "What is the most memorable interaction you had with any student?",
      "Not from here; this is one of the places I come from. There was a new engineering college, so I visited and took some lectures. Then, 7-8 years down the road, I got an email that said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know me, but you took some lectures for us, and that inspired me, and I am leaving Cambridge for a PhD, and I remembered you.‚Äù No better reward than this.",
      "From here, there was one student; once, there was a discussion in the class on how you want to grow and what you want to become, so he said I want to become like you.",
      "What would be the title of your memoir?",
      "People around me.",
      "What‚Äôs your life philosophy in one sentence?",
      "People around me.",
      "Is there anything you want to say to the student body?",
      "Live your life to the fullest, enjoy, and be happy. I would like to see you do great in the next 10 years. Be honest and be caring to others. One complaint or observation is that students who have gotten advantage of the old value system have now started questioning it. It‚Äôs not good. There is no escape from what is to be done, and that is being positive.",

      "The field ofSpace Science and Astronomyhas progressed significantly in recent years. India, along with many other countries, is actively exploring space and has ambitious plans for future missions aimed at achieving scientific and technological advancements.",
      "Despite this progress, a few years ago, India, and IIT Kanpur in particular, faced a gap in educational offerings in the field of astronomy and space engineering. According toProf. Pankaj Jain, Head of theDepartment of Space, Planetary & Astronomical Sciences & Engineering (SPASE), IITK, ‚ÄúIn India, while many research institutes contribute significantly to the field of astronomy, such as ARIES in Nainital, the National Center for Radio Astrophysics in Pune, and the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, these institutions primarily focus on research rather than education. Though some offer PhD programs, they generally do not provide undergraduate or Master‚Äôs degrees. Historically, academic involvement in astronomy in India has been limited, but this trend is now changing and expanding.‚Äù",
      "The concept for the department was introduced quite a while ago, around 2018. However, it got delayed due to COVID and other factors. And then there were several reviews before it actually took shape.",
      "The department followed a structured process to establish itself. Initially, a proposal was formulated by either an individual or a group of members. This proposal then underwent an initial review within the institution, involving feedback from various departments. Following this, the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) conducted a critical review of the proposal. After the EPC‚Äôs evaluation, the proposal was returned to the departments for additional feedback. It was then reviewed by a National Advisory Committee, consisting of prominent experts in the relevant field, before proceeding to the Academic Senate. Once the Academic Senate approved the proposal, it was finally submitted to the Board of Directors for the final decision.",
      "After completing this rigorous process, the SPASE department was officially established on January 12, 2022, under the leadership of then-Director Prof. Abhay Karandikar of IIT Kanpur.",
      "Establishing the SPASE department at IIT Kanpur presented several significant challenges. One of theforemost issues was determining the viability of job opportunities for graduates.With ISRO being the main employer for space roles in India, there were concerns about sufficient job opportunities to justify the department. Assessing the job market was crucial to ensure meaningful employment for graduates.",
      "Funding posed another significant hurdle. The department required substantial financial resources to support research, especially for hardware and experimental work. Initial funding of3 croresfrom IIT Kanpur was allocated, but it has already been utilized. To establish a solid foundation, the department estimates that around10 croreswill be necessary, with a long-term goal of50 croresto support the recruitment of additional faculty and ongoing initiatives. Securing this level of funding has been an ongoing challenge, though the department has obtained some support from the Space Technology Cell and IIT Kanpur.",
      "Another challenge was building awareness about the new department. Initial efforts to promote the department faced obstacles, with many on campus unaware of its focus. To address this, the department is actively working to increase its visibility and attract students through outreach programs.",
      "Space considerations present another substantial challenge. The department requireslarge lab spacesto accommodate the extensive hardware. Efforts are underway to acquire aspace-qualified detectorfrom the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which will be used to teach students about space-qualified instruments and their operational standards. The department is also exploring the potential of launching this instrument once it is fully operational.",
      "The complexity of working with hardware, as opposed to software, is evident. Space science involves large-scale projects such as rockets, observatories, and telescopes, all of which demand significant space and resources. The integration of hardware into the curriculum and the development of physical infrastructure underscores the department‚Äôs commitment to advancing space science education and research despite these considerable challenges.",
      "The SPASE department is currently staffed byseven full-time faculty members, complemented by Dr. Prashant Sharma, a joint faculty member, and two visiting faculty members. Additionally, Dr. Deepak Dhingra from the Earth Sciences Department has been closely associated with SPASE.",
      "The SPASE department features cutting-edge facilities to advance its research and educational goals. The Space Instrumentation Lab is equipped with charged particle, gamma-ray, and X-ray detectors, essential for monitoring space environments and serving as a student training ground. The Optical and Infrared Astronomy Lab offers optical instruments and a telescope, focusing on adaptive optics to enhance observational accuracy.",
      "The Radio Astronomy Lab is setting up experiments and a large antenna for the SWAN network, a national project aimed at creating a large-scale telescope.The SWAN project proposes anationwide radio astronomy networkwith 1000 sq. m arrays at multiple locations, including one currently atIIT Kanpur‚Äôs SPASE department.Operating at50-500 MHz, the network will study fast and slow radio transients and high-resolution imaging. This initiative will involve over40institutes across India and train hundreds of students in advanced radio astronomy research.For more information, lookhere.",
      "The Planetary Science Lab models planetary phenomena and includes a Planetary Geology Lab for studying planetary rock samples. Additionally, the Data Analysis Lab provides advanced computer systems for analyzing astronomical data. Collaboration with the Civil Engineering Department Lab, located near the airstrip, supports geodesic studies and space-based observations.",
      "Regarding student enrollment, the department currently has12 Ph.D. students. The M.Tech program began with modest enrollment: one student in the first year who left for a job, and two students in the second year, who also departed for similar reasons. The department is working to attract more students through the GATE exam and is optimistic about increasing enrollment in the future.",
      "The SPASE department at IIT Kanpur envisions growth and innovation over the next two to three years. The primary goals include expanding the faculty to attract experts in rocket control, satellite operations, and space technology, with plans to collaborate closely with ISRO. A key initiative is to establish a center for payload development to train students in designing and building space-qualified payloads.The department also aims to delve into exciting areas like space settlements, exploring challenges related to extraterrestrial habitats. Ensuring that courses remain aligned with global advancements is a priority, addressing the need for updated and relevant education.Additionally, fostering industry partnerships is crucial. The department seeks to collaborate with industries and startups on joint projects.",
      "Prof. Pankaj Jain emphasized, ‚ÄúWe are committed to leading in space exploration research and inspiring students to tackle the engineering challenges of venturing beyond Earth. IIT Kanpur‚Äôs strong intellectual foundation positions us perfectly to drive these pioneering efforts and prepare for humanity‚Äôs future in space.‚Äù",
      "The response to the Space Department‚Äôs research initiatives at IIT Kanpur has been promising. The department has observed significant initial interest in its courses, particularly those focused on astronomy and planetary science. Upcoming additions, such as a course on space technology and an undergraduate course offering a broad overview of the field, are expected to further boost interest.",
      "Despite being in its early stages, the department has already achieved notable research milestones. For example, a recent collaboration with theCosmic Ray Observatoryled to the discovery of a subtle deviation in the cosmic ray spectrum around160 TeV.This intriguing finding is set to be featured in an upcoming publication. Additionally, research utilizing data fromASTROSAT, India‚Äôs pioneering space-based science observatory, has provided new insights into neutron stars and their flux variations, contributing to the understanding of their equation of state.",
      "Dr. Ishan Sharma‚Äôs work onasteroid formationhas also yielded valuable findings, enhancing our understanding of how asteroids take shape.",
      "Notably, Dr. Prashant Pathakdiscovered a new giant planet,Epsilon Indi Ab, orbiting a Sun-like star. His research has been published inNature.¬† Read the research paperhere.",
      "As we explore new frontiers in space science, the SPASE department at IIT Kanpur is leading groundbreaking research and innovation. Their commitment to advancing space exploration and nurturing future scientists highlights India‚Äôs growing role in cosmic discovery.",
      "Vox wishes SPASE continued success and a Happy National Space Day to all.",

      "In the 48th and final edition of As We Leave 2024, we turn the spotlight on the journey of an unlikely candidate‚Äîone that‚Äôs defined by the thrill of the ride and the miles covered. This time, it‚Äôs not a person but a cycle, that has lived through countless stories and endless campus explorations. From late-night sprints to quiet rides along empty roads, this humble companion reflects on its time at IITK with a sense of fulfilment.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As I barely hold myself upright with the help of my stand, reminiscing the past four years on this campus, I realize it‚Äôs been a hell of a ‚Äòride‚Äô. From scorching heat to spine-chilling nights, I‚Äôve seen it all. From traversing the unexplored campus corners to staring into the nothingness of the academic area, I‚Äôve done it all. So have a seat, tighten your helmets, and pedal through my journey, where I become something more than just a metallic frame.",
      "I remember my first day on campus, standing with my friends on a basketball court in front of what seemed to be a humongous red building, showcased for those glittery-eyed freshers to choose us. Anyways, it wasn‚Äôt long before I was chosen by one such freshman, full of hope and naivety, eager to spend the next four years together. If only I hadn‚Äôt been wearing my rose-colored glasses back then.",
      "The initial days were nothing short of a honeymoon phase. Early morning rides to class, leisurely spins around the kargil chowk, and occasional weekend excursions. It was bliss, and I reveled in the newfound freedom, my tires gliding smoothly over every path. I got to relax in the parking shed after every tiring day, assured of my safety as my tires were locked to the rods on the wall. My new friends and I, all happy and shiny, shared tales of our exciting rides and laughed at the minor bumps along the way. Gossiping about someone‚Äôs flat tires and showing off our latest six digit tattoos was a regular routine. But as they say, good things don‚Äôt last long.",
      "The initial enthu of protecting me was gone. And before I knew it, the parking shed was replaced by the open sky. There were also times when I felt utterly alone. One day, amidst the chaos of endsems, I got lost. My already panicked fresher had hurriedly parked me outside the library, forgetting to lock me in the rush to cram for an upcoming test. I knew my safety was compromised. To add insult to injury, I was even pushed to the ground. There I was, lying in the dirt, waiting for him.",
      "The sun dawned, and I was still there, my frame aching from the rough treatment. As hours passed, I started feeling sleepy, abandoned, and resigned to my fate. Just when I thought I‚Äôd be left to rust, someone finally picked me up. But as I was regaining my poise, realization hit me‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt my naive fresher!",
      "I was reluctantly taken to an unfamiliar location. The majority of my new companions were old, worn out cycles. They were lifeless, probably because of the cruel acts of weather and road. I longed for the carefree days of my past. Now, I was accessorized with a torn lock, a sad testament to my condition. My once vibrant coat had lost its luster in a matter of days.",
      "But knowing that this is what I was now, I started getting accustomed to this new normal. My new owner was no fresh-faced novice but a weary soul, worn down by the grind of existence. He lacked the zest to ride with purpose. The daily trudge from the gate to the classroom was so dreary that I found myself feeling sorry for him rather than for my own state.",
      "Days passed, and the hope of ever returning to my previous owner faded away. My frame was slowly being eaten by rust. I had accepted this new lifestyle. Months, maybe even years, went by. One day, I found myself on a new road. I thought my owner had finally found some zeal for adventure. Little did I know, this road was a one-way ticket to a second-hand cycle sale.",
      "As I sat among other forgotten pieces, potential buyers wandered by, scrutinizing us with varying degrees of interest. Finally, a fresher approached. The gleam in his eye and the excitement in his step, I knew it all too well. He bought me, and for a moment, I thought I might feel that old thrill. But the newness was gone, and I couldn‚Äôt muster the same outlook for life.",
      "Gone were the days of eager anticipation and joyrides. Now, every pedal felt like a reminder of my faded glory. The fresher, brimming with enthusiasm, tried to breathe new life into me. But all his efforts turned futile. The damaged roads on the way to the academic area, flanked by trees on both sides, occasionally flooding in the rainy season, all these did give me deja vu, but not enough to give me the love for life that I once had.",
      "We, as cycles, are meant to serve some purpose, a purpose I had failed miserably at. The ‚Äòchain‚Äô of events had me freewheeling through life, and inevitably, my owner got fed up with me. I was abandoned near the Hall 12 gate, left to withstand the harsh weather until a guard took me and parked me near one of those cycle shops. The place where I once stopped for checkups had now become my home.",
      "So here I am, a rusting relic, a monument to faded glory and forgotten rides. It‚Äôs ironic, really. I once dreamed of endless roads and thrilling adventures, and now I‚Äôm just a pile of scrap, a cautionary tale for shiny new bikes with dreams of their own.",
      "But hey, if there‚Äôs a lesson in all this, it‚Äôs that life keeps pedaling forward, whether you‚Äôre shiny and new or a bit rusty around the edges. Though my frame is weathered and my paint chipped, the memories of my journey remain vivid. For every cycle out there, take heed: cherish every pedal, every bump, and every scrape, because the journey, no matter how bumpy, is what defines us. Keep your spokes crossed and gears in motion. Each dent and scratch tells a story of resilience and adventure, of moments spent racing the wind or carrying dreams under the starry sky.",
      "As We Leave, I realize that it‚Äôs not about the shiny exterior but the enduring spirit within. Embrace the challenges, celebrate your small victories. And let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwithout us, these nerdy brains would‚Äôve had a tough time hoofing it to the gate for those metro rides to Z square!",

      "In this 47th edition of As We Leave 2024, Harshit Raj, a Y20 student in the Department of Computer Science, shares with us his some snippets of his experiences at IITK, from taking ‚Äòexploring‚Äô very seriously and interacting with many people ‚Äì seniors and batchmates alike, to building and breaking tech in IITK and walking on his own path.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "You‚Äôll get to hear many stories about how things work out at the end in most of the ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù you read. This one is slightly different, this is about how small efforts fromyour endadd up to create the bigger picture. I‚Äôm not telling you that you are in control of your path, but the direction is in your hand. This ain‚Äôt a story of ups and downs. Not because I didn‚Äôt have ups and downs but because those don‚Äôt define me. This is the story of a guy who took ‚Äúexplore everything‚Äù quite seriously, using sheer ‚Äúenthu‚Äù alone. This story is an exciting, serendipitous, blessed, yet somewhat planned journey. In this piece, I‚Äôve tried to mention some core sections of my stay at IITK.",
      "‚ÄúYou see me as inferior in contrast to your idea of ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù But what is normal, but mediocre?‚Äù ‚Äï Ezra Claytan Daniels, Upgrade Soul",
      "Before you get started with mygraduation notes, here‚Äôs a bit of a prelude. This story is filled with abnormal situations and events, mostly because I do not like ‚Äònormal‚Äô in my life. Mediocracy haunts me. My ultimate goal in life is to not get bored. IIT Kanpur provides a pretty streamlined approach to advancing through the ranks. Observe in first year, secretary in second, coordinator in third, and observe again in fourth. But where is the fun in that, I did not climb this ladder; I made my own way. Despite having a decent list of PORs, none of them wassecretary.",
      "‚ÄúIf it is a user input, take it with a bucket of salt‚Äù ‚Äï Dr. Deepu Phillip, DoMS, IIT Kanpur",
      "This journey began with a very turbulent era. I didn‚Äôt like STEM. It was my third preference among my career choices. But in my heart, I knew this would be the easiest degree among my options. COVID hasn‚Äôt been kind to most, and I was no different. My coping mechanism was escaping. I‚Äôm (self-proclaimed)the greatestescape artists of all time. I was hypersocial in my initial years of college. I must have pinged (or bugged) almost all students of my branch. I gained many friends and acquaintances in this endeavor. I tried my best to help out as many peers as possible, but this ended, as all things inevitably come to an end. I‚Äôve taken up all the offered projects that intrigued me. I‚Äôve participated in (and won) all the events I found interesting.",
      "Next, I tried tointeractwith seniors and alumni. I pushed thisinteractionto a limit, and even as I graduate, I know more seniors than my own batchmates. I won‚Äôt say this was the best decision, but these connections really helped. Ps. I was on the other side ofinteractionswhen the campus was finally open.",
      "In all these experiences, I heard many opinions, perspectives, and advice. The beauty of IIT is that none of them were wrong, but only some of them were relevant. Everyone makes statements based on their experiences, and there can be a correlation between two situations, but it can never be the same.

      "Pretty early I got to witness the political shenanigans of IITK. I must admit it is nothing to be sneezed at. Students‚Äô elections in IITK are organized every year and we invite ~8K residents to participate and choose their next leader out of which nearly half show up. Is it not weird that most of them hear the same kind of stories and reviews? It is not. These talks, or call it rumors, are controlled by a mere few for most of the electorate never check on them. I mean why would they? It is convenient this way. The entire election is controlled by a mere ~100 students. This number is of a good election year, General Election 2022 was controlled by a handful. Who will triumph in this neither on intention nor on skills. I am a mere observer. I always had a side in every election but only by option of elimination.",

At this point, I‚Äôve explored machine learning, formal programming, theoretical computer science, etc. I‚Äôve invested my summer towards SWE. Intern season was fast approaching and I was left with algorithm design and computer systems to explore.

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "On April 28th, 2017, I was at IIT Madras, taking my MS exam. While returning from IITM, I received an email from the EE department at IIT Kanpur, stating that I had to appear for an MTech interview in 2017. Curious about experiencing the IITK campus, I decided to attend the interview. Over the next seven years, IITK became my home, where I earned both my MTech and PhD degrees.",
      "I still vividly remember those days; the memories are fresh in my mind. On May 5th, 2017, I arrived at IITK to attend my MTech interview, accompanied by my brother. I stayed in Hall 12 and had my interview on the 3rd floor of the ACES building. After the interview, I felt it went okay, but I never believed that I would actually become a student at IITK. However, when the results were announced, I was placed second. My whole family was elated, as no one from our village had ever joined an IIT before. Then came the dilemma: should I go for the PSU job I had already secured, or join the MTech program at IITK? I decided to join the MTech program, and on July 21st, 2017, I officially became a student at IITK. The past seven years at IITK have been an amazing journey, during which I have witnessed major turnarounds in my life.",
      "First-year (setback and comeback):",
      "My first year at IITK was a rollercoaster journey. During the first two months, I enjoyed my academics, the sports culture at IITK, and hostel life, which offered plenty of food options ;). I chose weightlifting as my primary sport and started training for the Inter IIT Sports Meet 2017. I scored very well on the quiz exams, which boosted my confidence in coping with academics. However, my focus soon shifted entirely to sports, with rigorous training sessions in the morning and evening. Then the mid-semester results came, and to my shock, I performed below average in the EE621 course. The very next day, while weightlifting, I severely injured my right wrist. I questioned myself: why did I come to IITK, and what was I doing here? I decided to quit sports for a while and focus on my studies. In the end-semester exams, I secured the highest mark, 37/40, while the course average was 22/40. This success made me realize that I am fit to be at IITK. Apart from academics, I formed good bonds with almost everyone from my Y17 SPCOM batch and a group of Telugu friends from Hall 10. I still cherish the moments we shared during breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Hall 10 mess. Friends used to say, ‚ÄúNo one can eat without laughing when Tentu is sitting beside you. :)‚Äù Good grades, good friends, and good laughs defined how my first year ended.",
      "Maturity phase (Second & third-year):",
      "In the second year, my life took a major turn both in my career and personally. My professor asked me if I was interested in pursuing a PhD. After thoughtful consideration, I chose to convert my M.Tech program to a dual M.Tech + PhD. We organized the 2018 Telugu Ganesh Chaturthi, Sankranti (Pongal), and Ugadi events. For the first time, my friends and I also ran a food stall during Antaragni‚Äô18. Although we didn‚Äôt make a profit, we managed to break even. During that period, I was fortunate to make some lifelong friends. Until then, I treated my female friends the same as my male friends, without considering how they might feel or if my words might hurt them. I learned that you cannot have the same approach with both male and female friends and that it‚Äôs important to respect each person‚Äôs perspective. I also realized that nothing is permanent in life, and this applies to friendships as well. I watched all of my M.Tech friends graduate and leave the campus while I slowly adjusted to PhD lab work.",
      "Covid period (Poetry):",
      "During the Covid period, I cleared my SOTA and was busy submitting my first journal. With nowhere to go and stuck in the same daily routine, I became completely bored. To escape this boredom, I began expressing my inner voice through Telugu poetry. I started a writing page on Instagram called ‚Äú‡∞§‡∞®‡±Å ‡∞Ö‡∞®‡∞Ç‡∞§‡∞Ç (tanu_anatham)‚Äù with the tagline ‚Äú‡∞Ö‡∞®‡∞Ç‡∞§‡∞Ç‡∞≤‡±ã ‡∞¶‡∞æ‡∞ó‡∞ø ‡∞â‡∞®‡±ç‡∞® ‡∞∂‡±Ç‡∞®‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞æ‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞ø‚Äù. The page name means ‚Äú(s)he is infinite‚Äù, and the tagline translates to ‚ÄúThe void hidden in the infinity‚Äù. The basic theme of this page is to explore the love, pain, sorrow, and suffering in people‚Äôs lives by connecting these emotions with Indian mythology or comparing them to the five elements of nature. I ensured there was no space for negativity on the page. Within six months, it surpassed 10,000 followers and now stands at 17,000 followers.",

      "This is how I escaped boredom during the Covid period.",
      "Post-Covid (Fitness 2.0):",
      "After the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to campus in August 2022. This is when I was introduced to the Adventure Sports Club IITK by Chidanand, Manoj, and Lavish. This phase completely changed my lifestyle as a student at IITK. Until then, I had focused only on strength workouts and could barely run 1-1.5 km. However, as people say, ‚ÄúYour friends‚Äô circle inspires who you become.‚Äù With the motivation from the Adventure Club, I completed the 10K run four times. We cycled 100 and 150 km, starting our rides early at 4 am, visiting iconic places in Kanpur such as Bhitargaon, Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary, and Kalpi, and returning to campus by evening.",
      "Of course, injuries and obstacles happen during cycling, and I cherish two such memories. One was while going to Nawabganj: in front of the IITK metro station, I toppled over a bicycle and severely injured my right wrist. My friends (Chidanand, Manoj, Guyana, Vijayanand Sir) insisted I quit the ride and return to campus. I chose not to and rode the entire 150 km by balancing the cycle with one hand. The second instance was while going to Kalpi. That early morning, I felt sick and had a stomach upset, leaving me with no energy for the cycling ride. Initially, I decided not to go, but after seeing my friends preparing, I changed my mind and joined them. On the return trip, with 30 km left to reach campus, I was completely dehydrated and exhausted but pushed myself to finish the ride.",
      "Thanks to the amazing Adventure Club team and their motivation, I developed a never-give-up mentality. I was also fortunate to serve as the Adventure Club secretary for 2022-23.",
      "Photography:",
      "During the conditioning sessions, I formed a good bond with Chidanand Jadar, who further introduced me to the world of photography. Together with some friends, we explored some of the lesser-known places at IITK, such as the Oxidation Plant and Aam ka Bagicha (the mango orchard behind the airstrip). Through these adventures, I discovered my love for portrait photography. Below are some beautiful and memorable pictures of my IITK friends that I clicked.",
      "Balancing my PhD research and fitness:",
      "While exploring my hobbies and passion for fitness, I never compromised my PhD research. My PhD was always my first priority. There were countless days when I worked until 2 am and still showed up at the PE ground for conditioning at 5:30 am. There were also times I worked through the night to meet journal or conference submission deadlines. In June 2020, I published my first journal, and frankly, I didn‚Äôt feel much excitement at the time. Perhaps I didn‚Äôt fully understand the value of that achievement. Subsequently, I published six more IEEE journals and presented at four international conferences over the next four years. One prominent memory from my PhD is writing a conference paper in just 2.5 days, sleeping only four hours a day, and successfully submitting it.",
      "I was also fortunate to guide B.Tech, M.Tech, M.S (R), and PhD students in their research. This wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the constant support of my M.Tech and PhD supervisor, Prof. Rohit Budhiraja. He was always available to help; you just had to knock on his office door, whether it was for research problem-solving, dealing with paper rejections, or personal issues. He treated his students like family. I must mention the financial support he provided during my last year when I needed it the most. Very few professors at IITK support their students in such a way. I was fortunate to work under Prof. Rohit Budhiraja for both my M.Tech and PhD theses.",
      "Conferences (Brazil 2022 and Italy 2023):",
      "My first international conference was held virtually, so I missed the opportunity to visit Canada. The second conference, GLOBECOM 2022, was held in Brazil, and a record six conference papers from my lab were accepted. Six of us labmates attended the conference in Brazil, with financial support from the institute and my PhD supervisor. Unfortunately, there were no direct flights available from India to Brazil, so we booked our travel with layovers in Europe. This allowed us to explore Paris, France, and Helsinki, Finland. We had a great time at the conference and met some of the well-known professors whose work I had cited extensively.",
      "I traveled solo to Italy for my ICC 2023 conference, with my conference travel fully sponsored by my PhD supervisor. Only a few professors in India support their students financially for conference travel, so I felt very fortunate. At ICC, I had a one-on-one interactive session with Prof. Emil Bj√∂rnson, a researcher I cite and follow the most in my work. This conference also allowed me to experience solo travel for the first time and explore myself.",
      "I traveled solo to Switzerland at my own expense, where I did two adventurous activities that I will cherish for my whole life. One was overcoming my fear of heights by skydiving from 13,500 feet. I experienced the feeling of weightlessness, floating in the air, and the intense fear after jumping out of the airplane. For the first time, I reached a terminal velocity of 292 km/hr. Those 50 seconds of free fall before the parachute opened are etched in my mind. If you ask me if I would do skydiving again, I would say yes, with a bit more immunity to the fear. I also witnessed fear in one of the female skydivers who jumped before me. As she looked at the view, she shouted, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to jump,‚Äù asking the tandem skydiver not to proceed. Nevertheless, he didn‚Äôt listen and jumped anyway.",
      "The second adventure was completing Via Ferrata M√ºrren solo. Although I was in good shape, I had zero experience in rock climbing or mountaineering. The Via Ferrata M√ºrren is rated as a K3 difficulty on a scale of K1 to K6, indicating that it is challenging and difficult. Despite my lack of experience, I decided not to book a guide and prepared to do it solo. You are always connected to a steel rope through a harness and two carabiners, ensuring that you won‚Äôt fall off. Walking along the steep rock face secured by a rope, with only thin air between your feet and the valley floor, provides an adrenaline rush.",
      "Even though I was doing it solo and felt afraid, I kept telling myself, ‚Äúone step at a time.‚Äù By the time I completed the 2.2 km stretch, I was very tired, but the sense of satisfaction from finishing something solo, without prior experience, is indescribable.",
      "The last mile: (M.Tech & PhD defense and 75 Hard)",
      "In October 2023, after submitting my seventh journal, likely the final piece of work for my PhD, I discussed defending my M.Tech and PhD with my professor. Around that time, I learned about the75 Hard Challenge, which involves adhering to six strict lifestyle rules continuously for 75 days to enhance fitness, health, and mental strength. If you fail to comply with any rule, your progress resets to day one, necessitating a fresh start. There are no excuses and no breaks. Daily tasks include: i) completing two 45-minute workouts; ii) drinking 4 liters of water; iii) reading 10 pages of a book; and iv) abstaining from alcohol and smoking (the latter two were easy for me as I don‚Äôt drink or smoke).",
      "For my workouts, I began with a 45-minute session at the gym in the morning, often extending it to 90-120 minutes. In the evening, I took a walk for my second workout. One of the challenges I set for myself during 75 Hard was closing my Apple fitness rings daily. This proved to be the toughest part, especially on gym rest days when I had to go for a walking workout to meet the ring goals after completing my two 45-minute sessions. I had a gym partner, Manoj Maurya, and we engaged in rigorous strength training workouts lasting 60-90 minutes, followed by an additional 30 minutes of abs workouts. This was particularly grueling as our bodies were already fatigued, but we ensured we completed the abs routine each time.",
      "During the 75 Hard challenge, I made sure that my academics wouldn‚Äôt suffer. I defended my M.Tech thesis on November 7th, 2023, and completed my PhD thesis. I gave my PhD open seminar on January 13th, 2024. After that, I faced a dilemma: should I join the industry (Qualcomm, Samsung, or Apple) or pursue a postdoc? I have always been interested in working in the industry, but not in India due to the less-than-healthy work-life balance (this is purely my personal view, not a reflection on anyone else). My options included joining an industry abroad or pursuing a postdoc and settling there.",
      "I appeared for postdoc interviews and received multiple offers. Ultimately, I decided to join Chalmers University in Sweden for my postdoc. The only disappointment was being rejected by University College London (UCL), which cited my unsatisfactory answers to non-technical questions as the reason. Here is the feedback from my UCL postdoc interview:",
      "‚ÄúHe was very strong candidate with a good presentation and interesting proposal. He gave satisfactory answers to the technical questions, less so on the non-technical questions relating to the role description.‚Äù",
      "",
      "It took some time to accept the UCL result. I defended my PhD thesis on May 30th, 2024, and I became emotional and cried during the acknowledgement slide, thanking everyone who was part of my beautiful M.Tech and PhD journey at IITK. For the first time, my parents visited IITK to attend my convocation. My graduation degree is a gift to my parents for all the hard work and struggles they endured to provide us with a better education. I dedicated my PhD thesis to my parents by acknowledging them in the dedication section of my thesis; it is as follows:",
      "‚Äú‡∞∞‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞ø ‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞µ‡±á‡∞¶‡∞Ç‡∞ó‡∞æ ‡∞Æ‡∞≤‡∞ø‡∞ö‡∞ø.. ‡∞Æ‡∞æ‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞¨‡±ã‡∞Ø‡±á ‡∞∏‡∞Æ‡±Å‡∞¶‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞Æ‡∞Ç‡∞§ ‡∞ï‡∞∑‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞æ‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞ø, ‡∞ï‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡±Ä‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡∞®‡∞ø ‡∞Ö‡∞°‡±ç‡∞°‡±Å‡∞ï‡±ä‡∞®‡∞ø, ‡∞Æ‡∞æ ‡∞®‡±Å‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ü‡∞ø ‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞§‡∞®‡∞ø ‡∞Æ‡∞æ‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞® ‡∞Æ‡±Ä‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞á‡∞¶‡∞ø ‡∞Ö‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡∞ø‡∞§‡∞Ç.‚Äù",

      "In this 45th edition of As We Leave 2024, Aravind, a Y21 student from the Department of Electrical Engineering shares his journey of taking bold decisions, giving up what seemed logical for what his heart wanted, and resolve to keep going and to not give up. His story, from giving up a high-paying job to prepare for GATE, to going to Purdue for further studies, tells us at every step, to follow our heart.",

      "With a wellspring of AWL articles swirling in my mind, each a vibrant tapestry woven from personal journeys, I found myself drawn to capture some threads of my own story.¬† As I sat down, pen poised, a tremor of nervousness ran through me.¬† Would I be able to sift through my private and not-so-private moments, to translate them into a compelling narrative?¬† A question echoed within me: who am I, and how has IITK shaped the person I‚Äôve become?A College Dream Deferred:",
      "They say the grass is always greener on the other side.¬† For me, that greener pasture turned out to be the very college experience I‚Äôd left behind.¬† During my undergraduate studies, I was fixated on landing a high-paying job.¬† So, I chased the biggest paycheck and ended up at a top-paying company.¬† Yet, from day one, a yearning for college life lingered.",
      "My work was engaging, but the memories of carefree days on campus continued to beckon.¬† It became a constant tug-of-war: the allure of a bustling Bangalore career with a hefty salary on one hand, and the sentimental pull of college life on the other.Then came the mischievous curveball of COVID. Working from home meant endless hours staring at a screen and attending calls ‚Äì a far cry from the vibrancy of the office. Yet, the lockdown brought unexpected joys. Sharing meals with friends, recreating school-taught experiments in the kitchen ‚Äì all these ignited a powerful nostalgia for college life.¬† Three months of lockdown cemented my resolve ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt be returning to the corporate grind anytime soon. With renewed clarity about my priorities and the freedom to define my own success, I sat down to map out my future. Turning 23, with some friends already married and starting families,I reminded myself that societal expectations needn‚Äôt dictate my path. Higher education beckoned. I tendered my resignation and returned to my beautiful Thiruvananthapuram home amidst the late monsoon rains as a confident ‚Äúindustry dropout‚Äù.",
      "Life wasn‚Äôt easy. Doubt gnawed at me. My friends were earning while I was back with books. Here I was, leaving a job I truly enjoyed when so many were desperately seeking employment. It was a difficult choice between two paths I valued. Preparing for the GATE exam in just 3-4 months seemed herculean. Managing my emotions and expectations was a constant struggle.¬† My parents, unfamiliar with engineering, could offer limited guidance but provided unwavering support ‚Äì reassuring me that even if I didn‚Äôt succeed immediately, we‚Äôd find a way forward together.‚ÄúSometimes we have to sacrifice something that is more beautiful for our eyes, for something that is more beautiful for our hearts.‚Äù",
      "Yearning for dedicated study time, I chose to stay alone at my vacant maternal home, with occasional visits from my grandparents.¬† A month of intense, well-planned preparation followed. The pressure was immense, but after countless tests and interviews, a beautiful email arrived on May 12th2021 ‚Äì an acceptance from the Head of the EE department, IIT Kanpur!",
      "Rekindling the College Spirit and Adapting to New Challenges",
      "With my acceptance letter in hand, I embarked on reconnecting with fellow students.¬† LinkedIn became my bridge to Shreyas Kulkarni and Raviteja, new classmates in the MS program.¬† COVID‚Äôs lingering uncertainty meant classes were initially online, a source of unexpected anxiety. Doubts about my decision resurfaced as I grappled with this unfamiliar territory. The online semester proved particularly challenging.¬† The shift from in-person learning was jarring, and the academic system itself was a whole new landscape. Relative grading and unfamiliar evaluation methods threw me for a loop.¬† Thankfully, my new friends became a lifeline.¬† Amitabh, Parampreet, Naman, Deepak, Rangesh, and the entire gang ‚Äì their online classes, study sessionsüòâ, and camaraderie became the key to exam success and the foundation of a strong friendship.",

      "Embracing the Campus Experience ‚Äì A Baptism by Fire (and Ice)",
      "The initial online semesters were a necessary adaptation, but the turning point came with the option to join campus life after the first semester.¬† On December 29th, 2021, I arrived at this stunning campus.",
      "{Yes, do you remember guys, masks were a pretty much norm then}",
      "My friend Tom Baby, also my BTech project partner, joined me to IITK on the first day.¬† Hailing from a region of perpetual 25-30¬∞C temperatures, the North Indian winter was a baptism by ice.¬† All I had was a hoodie I stole from my dad‚Äôs collection. At the hostel shop, we were told about ‚ÄúRajaai,‚Äù, but we assumed that it referred to some luxurious item based on our limited textbook Hindi.¬† Only at 2 am, as the temperature plummeted, did we grasp the true meaning of ‚ÄúRajaai‚Äù and the requirement of a room heater! From the very next morning, we all started our winter shopping spree. I finally conquered bathing in hot water and adjusted to the reality of sweaters, gloves, and socks becoming our 24/7 companions.¬† Also, four months later, the tables turned dramatically.¬† Temperatures soared past 40¬∞C, leaving my body as bewildered as I was ‚Äì extreme cold followed by extreme heat!",
      "But my friends, seasoned veterans of these seasonal swings, graciously guided me.¬† Also, by watching movies and conversing with them in Hindi, my conversational skills blossomed alongside my resilience. It was an experience that forged deep bonds, tested my adaptability, and ultimately enriched my college life.",

      "A Rollercoaster Ride: Embracing Challenges and Building Memories",
      "The initial arrival on campus was a surreal experience.¬† Masks became our constant companions as we explored the eerily empty grounds. This initial isolation gradually faded as students returned in April, culminating in a vibrant campus life by July.¬† With the WHO‚Äôs declaration, COVID seemed like a distant memory for many.",
      "Academics took a backseat as I revelled in the newfound freedom and opportunities compared to my state engineering college.¬† I was overwhelmed in the best way possible, actively participating in the ICS core team, Toastmasters club, Photography club, and even contributing to institute-level committees. Balancing research with these numerous involvements proved challenging, but the stress was a small price to pay for the memories I was creating. Trips to Varanasi, Nainital, Kedarkantha, Nepal, Ujjain, were all very much memorable.",
      "{Malayalam Vaedi Dance team; ICS Core Team (PG)}",
      "Naturally, academics suffered.¬† From facing potential termination to submitting and defending my thesis within a single semester from then, I experienced a whirlwind of emotions ‚Äì sadness, anger, the joy of friendship, and even a touch of love.¬† There were moments when the line between sanity and insanity felt precariously thin.¬† But I held onto a vision of a brighter future, a guiding light that propelled me forward.",

      "Looking back, leaving the comfort of a high-paying job to pursue higher education was a leap of faith. While it wasn‚Äôt without its hurdles, the rewards have been immeasurable. I encourage others to question the status quo and explore paths that align with their passions. Life is too short to settle for a paycheck when there‚Äôs a world of possibilities waiting to be discovered. IITK has been more than just an institution; it has been a catalyst for personal growth, a platform for exploration, and a source of lifelong friendships. The journey continues, but the foundation laid at IITK will forever be a part of me.‚ÄúEmbrace the uncertainty, for it is the canvas on which dreams are painted.

      "In this 44th edition of As We Leave 2024, Harsh Sharma, a Y20 student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, takes us through his memories at IIT Kanpur. He talks about the ups and downs he faced, and all the fun he had nevertheless.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Yesterday, I saw the reel posted by Vox stating that the ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù series for the graduating batch starts releasing the next day, and I suddenly realized that it is time that I finally start writing my own. After all, my whole college life had been all about doing stuff close to the deadlines (this time though I crossed the deadline, not the first time doing so).",
      "I have read many AWLs‚Äîsome very emotional and inspiring, and others dull‚Äîand I always wondered what my AWL would look like. Like everyone else, I too believe that I have a lot of stories to share and am different from others, but deep inside I know that nothing in IIT Kanpur is unique to an individual. You always share experiences, and that is what made my hard days in college bearable- thinking that someone else would have been in the same position as me or maybe in a graver situation, and yet they survived.",
      "I am not trying to inspire you, nor do I believe I am perfect or even a good person for that. I am someone whose trajectory you should never follow, but as I just mentioned, someone would be living the experiences I did and feeling the same things I did. My AWL is just a recollection of my life at IITK. Instead of just sharing my story in a chronological manner, I tried to express my emotions‚Äînot too much, for I believe that even though someone can go through the same situation as me, we can‚Äôt ever share the same emotions. That is what I call emotional prints, different for everyone, and your emotional print defines the person you‚Äôll become after every situation. If you had a rough night sobbing and crying, remember I had been in your place too; maybe I cried a little louder or you sobbed a little too much, but we all do make it to the end, for the end is as beautiful as the people we had in life. Don‚Äôt give up; it is all part of a bigger plan, and your role is just to keep on moving. Moreover, if you still want to derive some motivation or moral values out of this AWL, just follow the lines I did: Never give up, and whatever happens, happens for the best.",
      "My wingies with whom I had the best time on Campus, from L to R: Me, Saif, Prem, Mehul, Rishabh, and Navnee",
      "As I cleared JEE and saw my 3rd-standard dream of being an IITian turn real, I was elated and assumed the stereotypical lines of Bollywood movies ‚ÄúCollege me kaun padhta hai?‚Äù were true, and I have lived the stereotype to the fullest. Since the beginning of my Zoom days, I was always the try-hard kid‚Äînot the one who always tries to fit into different circles but the one who always wanted to try his hands at everything. Being someone who is not at all introverted, I quickly made friends in my department and with my wingmates, some of whom remained with me till the end of my time here.",
      "The first semester went bizarrely fast with me trying to cope with courses like MTH101 and PHY102, but I eventually ended up getting a B in both and a D in TA101. After all, I am bad at drawing, and that is the best excuse (evidently not) for folks like me. I also got into the first relationship of my life during the first semester, and fortunately, it is still intact, even though maintaining a long-distance relationship for more than three years was pretty tough. By the end of the semester, I had made more friends by participating in various competitions organized by different cells and councils, and I knew that joining more of them would help me make my circle bigger, even though this was never actually a plan.",
      "The second semester was dull and monotonous as the second wave of COVID hit the country, and the nth wave of procrastination hit me. I got addicted to helpful WhatsApp groups for passing the exams and eventually ended up dropping PHY103, afraid of the consequences after being caught cheating. This was the first blow to my studious life. From being admired for my dedication and hard work to dropping a course after being caught cheating, I quickly realized that college life was not going to be easy, and if I wanted to make the most of it, I had to be more cautious about everything I did here. I quickly resurfaced from it and started focusing on different clubs and activities. I joined Ecell, Udghosh, and Techkriti and tried to take gyan from seniors. I also got a summer project from the Astronomy Club, but the codes never fascinated me, and I eventually dropped out of it, realizing that this was not something that could hold me for life.",
      "The first year ended, and I was still anticipating the campus reopening. At the same time, the secy recruitment for SnT clubs began, and I was keenly eyeing only one entity‚ÄîIITK Consulting Group‚Äîsince it seemed like the best place for a person trying to break into consulting. This was a decision I made very early in my college life. I would advise any junior to completely exploit all the opportunities on campus before finalizing a career goal, unlike me, and even better if you don‚Äôt stick to one but keep on exploring more, as it drives you to keep on learning forever. I got recruited and was glad. At the same time, I got involved in more places‚Äîjoining Antaragni, Community Welfare Cell, and becoming a Student Guide and Academic Mentor by the end of the third semester. The campus reopened for resource-constrained students, and many of my friends went back. Since I didn‚Äôt get the chance to go to campus, I planned a trip with my college friends, during which I nearly escaped death after slipping from a hilly trail. I still owe my friend Rishabh a life for saving me.",
      "Finally, as the third semester ended, I cleared all my courses again, although I was expecting an E or F in ESO209. When the news of the campus reopening finally came, I started preparing for the new life I had always anticipated. I arrived on campus on December 29, 2022, and I felt proud of my hard work for making it there because the vibe was entirely different. The fourth semester began with a lot of fun. For the first time, I saw the places I had only heard about from seniors, met those seniors who shared their stories, and experienced everything with people as excited and eager as I was. The campus felt like home to me from the very first day.",
      "Amidst all the fun and explorations, I met a whole bunch of new people, and my circle grew. Among all the fun, I also had to ensure that I studied well for the fourth semester, as I had to pass some of the most difficult courses like ESO202 and ESO201. However, those who knew me would tell you that I never cared about studies as much as I should have, so you should not follow my example. As I said, IITK is full of people doing the same forbidden things.",
      "During the E-Summit, I had the opportunity to network with many startups and their founders. One such founder, Mr. Sumeet Mahendra of RTIwala, played a critical role in my life. I connected with him regarding an E-Summit competition, and eventually, the conversation turned to him seeking web development interns from IITK. Although I was never into technology despite being an engineering undergrad, I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the opportunity and asked him to schedule a meeting where we could discuss such prospects.",
      "I saw this as an opportunity to secure a project for ICG, as RTIwala appeared to be a promising startup with government accolades. In the meantime, I prepared a presentation to convince Sumeet to give a project to ICG. What happened during the supposedly 20-minute meeting, which lasted two hours, is an altogether different story, but apparently, I convinced him.",
      "The end of February also marked a significant moment in my life as I got the chance to work on an Inter IIT Tech Meet problem statement. The one-month journey changed my whole perspective on college life as for the very first time I realized that working on such challenging problems is what makes you an IITian for real and I would emphasize it in bold to anyone reading to try to participate in atleast one Inter IIT competition be it tech,sports or cult for it can teach way more than anything else on campus. Working on the problem statement, although very tiring and exhausting at times, was altogether fun. Thanks to all my teammates who bore me with my poorest jokes and all the seniors, who were ready to help me with even my dumbest doubts. Our hard work paid and we won the Gold Medal. This achievement gave me a sense of satisfaction as I remembered the lines I read somewhere ‚ÄúAgar IIT se graduate hote hue tumhari sabse badi achievement IITian hona hi hai toh tumne yahan aa kar kuch nahi kiya!‚Äù. With Inter IIT over, I again switched my focus towards RTIwala and started working as an intern with them. All three fests and their Pronites around the time came as a wave of celebration as I witnessed our college‚Äôs fests live for the first time.",

      "The end of February marked a significant moment in my life as I got the chance to work on an Inter IIT Tech Meet problem statement. The one-month journey changed my whole perspective on college life because, for the very first time, I realized that working on such challenging problems is what makes you an IITian for real. I would emphasize to anyone reading this to try to participate in at least one Inter IIT competition, be it tech, sports, or cultural, for it can teach you way more than anything else on campus.",
      "Working on the problem statement, although tiring and exhausting at times, was altogether fun. Thanks to all my teammates who bore my poorest jokes and all the seniors who were ready to help me with even my dumbest doubts. Our hard work paid off, and we won the Gold Medal. This achievement gave me a sense of satisfaction as I remembered the lines I read somewhere, ‚ÄúAgar IIT se graduate hote hue tumhari sabse badi achievement IITian hona hi hai toh tumne yahan aa kar kuch nahi kiya!‚Äù With Inter IIT over, I again switched my focus to RTIwala and started working as an intern with them.",
      "All three fests and their Pronites around that time came as a wave of celebration as I witnessed our college‚Äôs fests live for the first time.",
      "I was very confident about securing the leader position as I had put my best foot forward to prepare for the role, talking to seniors and my fellow secretaries to gather more insight into the workings. I was also putting in my best efforts to work with RTIwala to gain credibility from their end as well. At the same time, I offered two summer projects on behalf of ICG, one in collaboration with others and the second one alone. To handle all these things and to prepare well for the intern season, I decided not to retake PHY103, which I had dropped earlier, as I was aware I would not be able to put much effort into studying it, and my grade would be low‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt want for the intern and placement season.",
      "Having done all my preparation, I appeared for the interview, and when the results came, I was lost. I was not made the leader. I couldn‚Äôt understand why it happened, as my intentions and efforts were all for the best. I introspected into my 20-year-long life until then and realized that whenever I worked hard for anything, I never lost. So, why now? I wanted to be the leader not just to hold the PoR but because I wanted to harness the full potential ICG had. I thought it could give me a portal to work with amazing startups, startups that had fascinated me since the time of TVF, making me realize that ‚ÄúMein beer hu.‚Äù I firmly believe that as a leader I would have done my best for ICG, but I also totally respect the panel‚Äôs decision not to make me the leader, as I believe they would have thought, just like me, the best for their group.¬† At the same time, I also think that if I had been made the leader, maybe I would have taken it as yet another easy win and would not have done the things I did because I was not made the leader. Today, I am thankful that it happened the way it was meant to, for God‚Äôs plan is better than ours.",
      "To revive myself from the blow, I went home, channeled my energy, and came back to campus. I am really thankful that my home was just an overnight journey away, so whenever I felt low, I went back home and talked with my family members‚Äînot about the problems in my life. I don‚Äôt remember if I ever shared any problem in my life with any of my family. I wanted to learn to fight things alone and always viewed these problems as insignificant to be shared, no matter how big they seemed at the time. Eventually, I realized this practice helped me learn that no problem in the world is bigger than you perceive it to be. I just talked with them and thought about how I have people in my life for whom I have to do something. Settling down easily isn‚Äôt an option as long as I can keep going.",
      "At the same time, the nominations for the manager of the Outreach Cell were out, and it was the last third PoR remaining to be filled at the time, as far as I remember. So, I applied for it as I was eager to gain a shortlist with Bain and BCG, which were supposed to be coming for the intern season for the first time. I‚Äôll keep this part short: I applied for the PoR, got it, and didn‚Äôt make it to the shortlists of either company, thanks to my low CPI and my foolishness in forgetting to mention my Tech Meet Gold Medal on the resume I submitted to Bain. Not getting shortlisted was a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as I was not really expecting the shortlists.",
      "Phase 1 of the intern season was not very happening for me, as I only got one shortlist, and that too for a machine learning role, thanks to the online assessment. How I wish the interview was also with the video turned off. By the end of Phase 1, I was without any internship from the campus.",
      "But on and off campus, I was trying my hands at different things yet again. A new society was in the making‚ÄîProduct Management Interest Group‚Äîand one of the Y19 founders, Kritarth, knew me well from the Inter IIT time and asked if I wanted to join. Being an opportunist and eager to work for such a society, I said yes at once. I started helping them organize boot camps and workshops while also gathering insight about product management as a field, which looked like yet another domain where I could try my hands.",
      "At the same time, I saw a post on LinkedIn from a Y18, who I only knew by name, hiring marketing interns for his startup, and it was unpaid. I scrolled past the post. As the first two months of Phase 1 had already passed without me having any internship, I spent time on Workday and LinkedIn searching for opportunities. One day, I saw the same job opening for the unpaid marketing intern again. My gut feeling told me to download the app ‚ÄúNevermind.‚Äù My inner voice said it truly holds what I want to do, an odd but intriguing name. I explored it briefly, closed it, and opened Instagram to procrastinate, but Nevermind opened instead with a question. Then I understood their USP‚Äîevery time you open an unproductive app, you first have to solve a habit-building question. It was this eureka moment that led me to text the recruiter, Sriram, on LinkedIn, telling him I wanted this intern position. We got on yet another supposedly 10-minute call, which turned into an hour, with him telling me everything about his startup and saying, ‚ÄúYes, we need someone to handle our business aspects, but for that, you need to prove credibility.‚Äù I started working hard to make the best use of this opportunity, from devising and executing strategies to gain downloads to leading pitches with VCs.",
      "Apparently, in a few days, the founders agreed to settle me as their co-founder and to let me lead the business and growth verticals. At this crucial step, I again pitched to Sumeet to help us as a mentor in our startup. His advice helped us a lot, and we reached out to multiple VCs across India, trying to gain some funding. While most of them liked our idea, and we managed to win Upstart‚Äô23 and also secured a pitching round in an international trade conference, we were not able to secure any funds. Still, we thought of implementing some strategies.",
      "By the end of 2022, I had no internship but only Nevermind in hand, and our core team decided that either we secure some investments by the end of March or Nevermind should end. I forgot to mention earlier, but in the fifth semester, I was also seeking projects with foreign professors to gain international experience. Although I got two such projects, one with a professor from Wharton, I decided not to continue with either as they were related to a domain I was least interested in‚ÄîWeb Development. It was tough for me to turn down such an opportunity, but I was firm about not doing something that didn‚Äôt fit my interest. It isn‚Äôt a decision I am really proud of, as I gave up something without really trying it, but deep down my heart told me, even if you try and make something out of it, would the journey be enjoyable? This was a question I always carried with me: if it isn‚Äôt about the destination but the journey, make sure it is happening and enjoyable. No worries if it is chaotic, but make sure you surf on the highest tides if there are any. But I know this is not for everyone reading. You might not be fortunate enough to neglect your responsibilities and just keep on following your passion. If you are not, just try to make what you do as enjoyable as possible; otherwise, the going gets tough.",
      "It might look like most of the things I did were to build a solid resume, and I won‚Äôt shy away from saying that indeed a few things I did were to give a boost to my CV‚Äîafter all, no pursuit is without a cause. But some of the things I did were purely out of interest and passion‚ÄîNevermind and Inter IIT Tech Meets being two such things. Apparently, I got yet another chance to do what I love the most: work on another Tech Meet problem statement. This problem statement, although barely a week long, was more hectic than the last one, as I had to work more than 14-15 hours daily straight for nine days. Thanks to amazing seniors and the sweetest juniors who were ready to sit and work for as long as I did. Yet again, we won the Gold Medal, and I felt a sense of relief amidst the chaos in my mind, as Nevermind was still bootstrapped and the scholarship amount we secured from SIIC was on the verge of being completely burned.",
      "Another Tech Meet, another Gold Team",
      "In the middle of February, I received a very unexpected phone call from Sumeet Mahendra. He told me they were about to raise a round from a UK-based VC and wanted me to join them after graduation on a full-time basis in a leadership position. The proposed salary was good, the ESOPs were more than good, and the equity I was offered was beyond my imagination. I had two days to respond to the offer, as they had to submit my name to the VC for due diligence. I talked with as many people as I could about this offer, and while most said I should go for it, I turned it down.",
      "I thought, if a startup‚Äôs CEO, who has known me for barely a few months and has never met me in real life, has this much conviction in a third-year student, why should I settle for less? I knew there was a high possibility that Nevermind would not gain the expected funding and might shut down, and also the possibility that the placement I might get would not be as lucrative as the offer in hand. But I still decided not to go for it, as my gut feeling said my destiny was not there. Reflecting on my life, I see many decisions I made were based on my gut feelings, and somehow the trajectory I achieved through them turned out fine. I really believe decisions made from the heart and intuition are more inclined toward your best interest, as your inner voice would never let you choose something that could cause you unhappiness. Always listen to yourself before others, for you know yourself the best, and others know only a version of you. The 8 billion people in the world live different notions of life every day, and it is your notion and perspective of yourself that should matter most to you.",
      "By the end of March, Nevermind was history as we couldn‚Äôt secure any investments. It was another heart-wrenching event in my life, but I was prepared for it and thanked God for the learning experience. It was at this time that I started becoming serious about internships and summers. Around the corner, PMIG was also formalized as a group, and I saw yet another dream of establishing something for the campus community come true. I put in genuine efforts to do as much as I could for the group and the campus junta through it, and I am grateful to my co-leaders Ayush and Bhavya for having the same mindset as me. I wish to see the society grow in the coming years and students benefiting from it.",
      "Around the same time, I applied for the position of Overall Coordinator of Outreach Cell, but as destiny had it, I was not made the OC. This time, I was not sad about not getting the position, as Gitika and Utkarsh, who became the OCs, did complete justice to the position, and all of us managers from Outreach Cell are still the best of friends.",
      "Before the end of the th semester, two crucial events took place. GC happened, and I became the pool captain for Takneek, a pun to my identity of having no interest in tech. But this was something I genuinely wanted to do for Hall-3, not for the sake of improving my resume, as I already had many things on it. I can‚Äôt contain myself from saying that the entire GC was full of biases, especially against our pool (Aryans), and anyone who witnessed it couldn‚Äôt counter that. Long story short, I was impeached from my pool captain position mid-Takneek, as was the Aryans‚Äô Galaxy pool captain. But by then, the Hall feeling had gone beyond any position or name. Everyone, especially our group ‚ÄúGC wale Launde,‚Äù neglected everything to win the GC for Hall-3. Although we couldn‚Äôt win any of the GC events, thanks to the organizing teams and their bias towards their favorite halls, the friends I made during GC are still very close to me. All the seniors, batchmates, and juniors developed a mutual feeling of respect for each other, and I am pretty sure that anyone who participated on behalf of Aryans in that GC can never forget the efforts we put into winning the cups.",
      "GC wale Launde",
      "During the end semesters for the 6th semester, I had no intern in hand, and my startup didn‚Äôt exist anymore. Suddenly, Accenture visited the campus to hire interns for a role where coding was not a prerequisite. I thought this might be my chance but wasn‚Äôt too hopeful, as I had had the same thought more than ten times before. But it happened‚ÄîI was shortlisted after the test, thanks to my friends, and my interview went decently well. Summer break was meant to begin on May 4, and on May 3, around 8:30 PM, my roommate Mehul told me that someone he knew got into Accenture and asked me to check if I managed it. Although I was pretty sure I would face defeat yet again, the moment I opened the mail to find SPO‚Äôs congratulation mail, I told Mehul, and we both shouted at the top of our voices. Fast forward a few weeks or months, I went to Mumbai for my internship, explored the city, met new people, and worked. I knew I was not going to get a PPO, as the company had already announced it in the first meeting itself, yet I worked in the hope of getting one. As announced, no one got a PPO, but I still managed a LoR from my manager and some praises from the senior leadership of the company for my work.",
      "By the end of summer, back on campus, I started preparing for product roles, as my resume was more inclined toward it, and consulting looked like a far reach since my CPI was not in the safe bracket. With the semester starting, I was enjoying the peace of a single room and the vibe of Hall-1. One day, while sitting in the canteen, a friend I made during GC in Hall-3, Avi, who was now Udghosh‚Äôs festival coordinator, approached me and asked if I wanted to be the Head of Media and Publicity of Udghosh. I declined, saying I wanted to focus on my placements and, as I had no idea about the vertical at all, I might screw up. But he convinced me to think about it for a few days. I was sure to turn down the offer as I didn‚Äôt want to shift to B-bot, leaving all my wingies behind, and I wanted some peace during placement sem. Still, one day I contacted Anand Patwa, who was the MnP Head of Antaragni and worked with me during the Inter IIT Tech Meet, to ask what I should do, and he said to go for it. I blindly followed his advice.",
      "I can assure you that joining Udghosh was an amazing decision in my life as it taught me the real meaning of management. The Core Team was wonderful, and being a novice to the vertical, I got much-needed support from them. The two months went by bizarrely fast, and the fest concluded well. Now, it was time to switch gears again as companies had started approaching for placements. The companies I was targeting the most were Flipkart and Groww. I worked hard on Flipkart‚Äôs PS, but as destiny had it, I didn‚Äôt make the shortlist. So while working on Groww‚Äôs PS, I was very reluctant and hopeless, completing the submission within 10 hours or so, not expecting a shortlist. But this time I did manage a shortlist. Fast forwarding to November 30, I had a single shortlist in 1.1, four shortlists in 1.2, and no other shortlists after that. I was pretty sure I‚Äôd manage an offer in 1.2, as two of the shortlists were for product roles, and I knew I had prepared well.",
      "I would also like to share a fact here that my sister, my very own sibling, was meant to be married on December 4, thanks to my father who didn‚Äôt ask me before finalizing the date. So, I slept through 1.1 as the company I was shortlisted for didn‚Äôt call me for an interview. 1.2 began with Groww‚Äôs interview, which went fantastic, and in the meantime, I appeared for the Tata1mg interview, which also went quite well. The second round for both companies was at the same time, and a senior from Tata1mg said it was my call where I wanted to go. At that moment, I chose to go for the Groww interview. The second round was better than the first one, but apparently, Groww had rejected all the interviewees after the second round, including me. I rushed to Tata1mg for a chance but couldn‚Äôt manage one as I had ‚Äúmade the choice‚Äù to go for Groww. Meanwhile, I missed the GD for Palo Alto Networks as I knew I had no scope there, and Groww and Tata1mg interviews were more promising. Then I went for the Indus Insights interview, but by the time my second round began, people were already getting offers, and I knew right from the beginning of the second round that they were doing it just for formality. Day 1.2 was over, and I had no job in hand. Day 2.1 was about to begin in a few hours, and I had no shortlist and had to reach home for the wedding. I didn‚Äôt pick up calls from anyone at home and avoided any messages. I prepared myself for Day 2.1 and sat there for 4-5 hours straight without any walk-ins. 2.2 was no different, except I mistakenly picked up a call from my father, and all he told me was not to worry and do what I felt like. I got back to my room after 2.2 and broke down in my room after midnight on the call with my girlfriend as I had no shortlists the next day either.",
      "Amid all this chaos, the only thing constant with me was my friends‚ÄîMehul, Rishabh, Avi, and Daksh‚Äîwho all had a bunch of copies of my resume for walk-ins. I woke up on the 3rd morning to find I had a shortlist from Niva Bupa, and the interview began in an hour. Although hopeless, I still gathered the courage, prepared the introduction, and went for the interview. Mine was the first interview. I entered the room, and it went well for about 45 minutes. I came out expecting to hear updates about the following rounds, but there were none. The company took as many as 100 interviews, and it was already 8 PM without any result. I was frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. I went back to my room and couldn‚Äôt think of what to do. My sister‚Äôs wedding was the next day, and I had no clue if I should go home or stay. I broke down again‚Äîfor the first time in my life, I broke down that way. Then suddenly, I got a call from my friend that the company‚Äôs HR wanted to meet me. I raced at my highest speed and reached Hall 12, and I managed an offer. It was the most relieving and comforting moment of my life, for I knew now I could go and fulfill my responsibilities.",
      "I left for home at the earliest and attended the function. On December 5, when I woke up after a tiring previous day, I got the most unexpected result of my graduation life‚ÄîI got a backlog in a DC, in a course I never thought of. I tried reaching out to the course instructor, but he ended the call after hearing my name. I was tense again for the whole of December, trying to find a solution to the problem of degree extension and ranting about no compartment exams, etc., to my fellow friends who also failed. By the way, around 25% of the department failed the course. As I couldn‚Äôt find a way out of it, I thought of letting it be, for it was meant to be. Out of all the semesters I spent at IITK, the 7th one was the only one where I wasn‚Äôt expecting a backlog, and I managed it eventually, so life always has ways to bring you the unexpected.",
      "I spent my last semester doing everything I could before my college life ended, went on trips with friends, went on a solo trip, tried different ‚Äústuff,‚Äù and many more things. The semester ended with me passing all the courses, including PHY113, a substitute for PHY103. Yes, I did it with Y23s, so what? :‚Äô) Slowly, everyone started departing, and the realization that the faces of some of the best people would never be seen again hit me. So that‚Äôs how college life ended‚Äînot for me exactly, as I am still doing the modular DC in which I got an F.",

      "If this article is published before June 15, 2024, you might find me on campus, and I allow you to question me, ‚ÄúBina campus se gaye As We Leave likh diya?‚Äù So, yes, for me, the leaving date is a bit later than others, but sooner or later, everyone has to leave.",
      "At the end, I sincerely want to thank all the friends I made here for coming into my life at the right time, fitting in just like the pieces of a jigsaw. I have been privileged to have the company of the best people in my life, and the only question I have in my heart as I‚Äôll be leaving this place is whether I have been as good to the people here as they have been to me. I hope that as I leave this place, I leave a mark in the hearts of at least those who mattered to me.",
      "That was my journey, a collection of stories through the semesters, where I had no control over the upcoming challenges but still managed to survive, knowing that it was a phase and it would pass, and the best was waiting for me at the end. I embraced whatever I got as the best. Still, I would seriously suggest any junior reading this not to follow in my footsteps, but I know someone as foolish and opportunistic as I am would be at the same crossroads. Down the line in a few years, another AWL with more or less similar content will be published.",

      "In this 43rd edition of As We Leave 2024, Aryash Pateriya, a Y19 student with a double major in the Computer Science and Civil departments, shares his 5 year journey about personal stories. He humorously recalls his early struggles with weight and shyness, his growth through student activities and the impact of covid-19.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hi, I‚Äôm Aryash, and this is my story. I was lucky enough (well, in some sense) to witness 5 years at IITK. This extended stay has given me a full spectrum of experiences and memories I‚Äôd like to share. Being the same as you, I consider this article lengthy and that‚Äôs why I have divided it into three parts. The first concerns my campus story with all the experiences I gathered in a humorously toned rollercoaster way, the second is opinions and views as a senior which concerns the campus and falls in my domain to address. The last is a ‚Äòlater added‚Äô bonus part of how life showed me another dimension of circus even upon graduation. So, you are free to go through any part you like and skip whatever you feel, it‚Äôs just vox has given me this opportunity and I have tried to put my heart out. Though I can confirm that all the three parts are written to address your perspective and would certainly provide you with something to ponder. Although I understand the goldfish attention span we have these days.",
      "Part 1:The cream and brick (Tum bohot mast kaam karta hai, campus bhai!)",
      "Same old ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be focusing much on academics‚Äù clich√© to begin with here as well.",
      "I arrived at IITK on July 20, 2019 and at that time, if you‚Äôd seen me and a bean bag side by side, my guess is you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell the difference (well at least I can body shame myself). I weighed a whopping 97 kg. While I joke about it now, my weight was partly the reason I was a bit shy back then.",
      "My first year was a nice little sin(x) curve, with the toughest task being waking up for the dreadful 6 AM PE classes. The worst mistake? Choosing NCC over Hockey for CPA. I still hold a grudge against my SG for that gem of an advice (sorry, Priyanshu!). Honestly, I can‚Äôt recall much, but I do remember spending most of my time inside my room. So, that whole ‚Äúfirst year is for exploring and trying different things‚Äù mantra didn‚Äôt quite apply to me. You feel lost when a lot is going on and you‚Äôre a bit clueless. I must confess that one of the reasons I joined Vision was for their sexy hoodie (which I never got, by the way). Despite my ulterior motive, it was a place where I learned a lot of technical stuff during my short stay. I tried my hand at an EClub event during Takneek, but I guess the breadboard hated me as much as I hated it.",
      "But yeah, being an introvert allows you to express yourself in other creative ways. I was interested in writing poems and stories, both in English and Hindi, playing FIFA, and had a fondness for making memes. There was a Facebook page called ‚ÄúIITK Shitposting‚Äù made by seniors, where I initially shared memes. The good response boosted my confidence, and I started sending memes to the IITK Meme Cell. Luckily, they also received positive feedback, which caught the eye of Abdulla (the page admin and a wonderful senior). He asked me to become a co-admin. I still remember my first ever ‚Äúofficial‚Äù meme from the page‚Äîit somehow hit 50K likes. Together, we took the page to the heights of Burj Khalifa (with COVID being our peak, sorry!).",
      "Post that, we went home¬† for a 1.5-year-long vacation in the second semester. I still remember making a meme that said, ‚Äúyou crazy son of a b****, you did it,‚Äù thanking COVID for the 15-day extension after the midsem break. Well, who knew! During that time, people around me were diving into Coursera courses, and every second person on LinkedIn suddenly became an AI/ML enthusiast. While I applaud those who capitalized on this and did well, I didn‚Äôt think it was for me. Instead, I focused on our institute‚Äôs curriculum, and on Ramayana and Mahabharata (both the TV shows and the daily epic dramas of my family).",
      "I joined the GameDev Society as a secretary because of my love for video games and the tech behind them. I also tried my hand at the newly formed Humor House, attempting stand-up comedy and contributing to roast sessions. It was there I realized that making people laugh is not easy, but it‚Äôs incredibly satisfying when you succeed in doing so.",
      "It was during the online phase that I made some wonderful friends who remain close to me even today. One of my core groups consisted of 8 friends from the civil department. Somehow, we all shared the same sense of humor and approach to life, despite our differences. We often had ‚Äúnot-so‚Äù intellectual discussions late into the night on Discord. If you‚Äôre awake until 4 AM at home, talking about nothing but rubbish while your parents are trying to sleep, you have to find a way to make it work. I used to sneak out into the verandah and walk for hours while on Discord. A few days later, I realized that I had lost weight doing this. So, my diet plan wasdrumrollwalking while talking rubbish for hours. On a serious note, I kept up this routine, walking 2.5-3 hours daily for the next 1.5 years, and ended up losing around 25-30 kgs. For me, it significantly boosted my social confidence.",
      "COVID was tough and it hit close to home when both of my parents were quarantined. A special thanks goes to my sister, who was also studying yet managed to take care of every chore with limited help from me (as I get colds very often and posed a risk). Tragedy struck when I lost my grandfather during this time. His passing left a crucial impact on me and inspired me to strive to be a kinder and better human being, just like he was.",
      "A quick flashback to my orientation reminds me of how I became enamored with the culture and the Y17 CS Core Team in general. It was an utterly delightful experience. That moment sparked the decision to be a part of the Core Team if I ever got the chance. Life was simpler then, when people didn‚Äôt join councils just for the sake of padding their resumes. I‚Äôd advise against blindly chasing a PoR solely for that reason. But if you‚Äôre genuinely interested, by all means, give it your all. My love affair with CS continued when I became an SG and built a wonderful family consisting of the best bunch of misfits an SG could ask for.",
      "Following that, I boarded the ship as an Operations Core Team member in CS, and I consider that to be the pivotal moment in my shift from a shy introvert to a more social and expressive person. It wasn‚Äôt that people forced me to change myself (which obviously sounds evil), but it was the love and welcome I received that gave me a sense of belonging, as if I had found a family. We delved into online mode and never ended meetings without musical nights or delving into meaty gossip until late into the night. Despite our differences in opinions, the bond we formed resembled Nokia 3310. Around this time, I was also allotted a double major along with two of my best mates across different disciplines, making us realize that we ain‚Äôt separating anytime soon. And that was awesome because these guys were the integral part of my 5-year survival kit.",
      "We were summoned by the Head CS around October 2021 to welcome Y20s (resource constraint students) back to campus, as they were new arrivals (ironically, it felt new to us too). Our plans for a trip to Udaipur, painstakingly finalized after marathon parliament sessions over 1-2 months, had to be scrapped. But the sheer joy of returning to campus outweighed any disappointment. It was a moment of realization about the true value our campus held for us. So, we returned and indulged in awesome team night-outs, strolled through the empty campus with every area accessible, and with no one around to stop us. Those days, my friends, were the absolute best.",
      "It was around this time that I met Prakriti (I have to specially mention her for being the greatest someone to me). I can‚Äôt do enough justice to the bond we shared in this blog, so let it be a completely different story for some other day. But yeah, I thank her for everything.",
      "Coming back from the personal diversion, another tragic incident struck everyone‚Äîthe Ganga Barrage incident (RIP Sejal, you are missed). Everyone was shocked and in tears, and it was very hard to console people, as it was a really tough loss. The only positive thing that came out during that phase was the unity in student councils. Not only CS, but everyone from the then Gymkhana, other cells, and miscellaneous volunteers came together and spent sleepless nights to take care of the students and handle the situation. That was the time I was really proud to see the student unity culture in IITK, and I hope to see it rise in the future.",
      "Now was the time for the entry of Y21s onto campus, and for us, it meant holding the orientation stage. We spent many nights planning, preparing sessions and slides, and facing the occasional scolding from the coordinators, all to ensure that the upcoming batch received the warmest welcome, even in the online phase. To our delight, we received a lovely response, making all our hard work worth it. Y21 will always hold a special place in my heart as my favorite junior batch. When they finally arrived on campus, we organized a second, offline orientation with the same passion, and received a similar response from our juniors. It was a fulfilling experience to finally fill the shoes of someone I used to idolize. I even got one of the best bunch of grandkids. Upon handing over the charge to the Y20 core team, we were grateful that we passed the baton to a very nice and sweet set of people.",
      "Next up was the internship hunt season (since I was academically parallel to Y20s now), and I decided to face the scorching summer heat by staying on campus for the summer. Let me offer a humble piece of advice: unless you have serious business, steer clear of the campus during summers. That scorching heat was like nothing I‚Äôd ever experienced before. Temperatures soared to a blistering 45-48 degrees, and standing in the sun felt like experiencing live evaporation. Anyway, amidst our battle for survival against the environment, internship preparation was in full swing. And that‚Äôs where something unexpected happened, something that would leave a profound impact on my later career. Two of the top consulting firms decided to swoop in to hire interns for the very first time. Personally, I didn‚Äôt have much knowledge about consulting at the time. I saw it as just another opportunity and decided to apply, alongside tech roles. As I delved deeper, I realized the hype and craze surrounding management consulting were already unreal, and yet somehow, it was all new to me. They interviewed us early and made on-the-spot offers. For me, it seemed like an exciting new venture, and with the future uncertain, I took the opportunity. I didn‚Äôt give the interviews of other firms I was shortlisted for. After all the chaos, it was time to move into the fourth-year hostel. In my original wing, there was some segregation of groups, it was like stepping into the middle of a political battleground. And frankly, I had no interest in getting tangled up in that mess. Luckily, at the same time, a wing from Hall 3, where I‚Äôd spent my scorching summer days, welcomed me with open arms. It never felt like I was an outsider; they embraced me as if I‚Äôd always been one of their own. I can proudly say that it was no longer just ‚Äòthe new wing‚Äô to me‚Äîit was now ‚Äòmy wing‚Äô. I had some of my best and most happening days with these folks (or should I say, brothers)",
      "I had one of the best lifetime experiences during my internship in Mumbai, but first, I want to give a sincere shoutout to my co-interns from IITK, the Y20s, for being absolutely awesome. There was no senior-junior divide with us; I blended in quickly thanks to their efforts. During the internship, I made some of my best friends here, with whom I still discuss various gossips, while also sharing the BTs of our lives. My case was in finance and was pretty exciting too. I got to meet many cricketers from Mumbai Indians personally at the hotel, and the weekends were a whirlwind of exploring Mumbai to its very depth. Think Lonavala, treks, local trains, mystery rooms, Imagica, night cycling, and lavish parties along with discovering every nook and cranny of the city.",
      "After some months, I received the PPO from BCG, and just a minute before the deadline the next day, I made the decision to decline it. So, what went wrong? Personally, I didn‚Äôt see consulting as something I wanted to pursue further. Investing all that time of the week, often in a rush, sometimes even for smaller tasks, didn‚Äôt seem worth it to me. I also didn‚Äôt want to abandon tech, which had been my focus for the past four years. Now, I may be completely wrong, and all these views are personal, but it is what it is for me. Perhaps I‚Äôll be doing something else later in life. I just want to emphasize that if you have the chance to choose something today that might affect your life later, choose whatever aligns with your passion today and don‚Äôt hold any regrets. Do I regret joining BCG as an intern? ‚Äì No. Do I agree with my decision to reject the full-time offer? ‚Äì Yes. Is this the right call? ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know, but I will try my best to make it.",
      "(And this led to the part 3 of this article)",
      "Ah, final year, and along came the placement season. With all the talks of ‚Äúthe market is down‚Äù and ‚Äúcompanies won‚Äôt turn up,‚Äù the start wasn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd call ideal. Here‚Äôs a word of advice: please don‚Äôt overload your 7th/9th sem for obvious reasons (I did and felt like a bit of a sandwich). If nothing else, it‚Äôll give you some mental peace. Anyway, with another semester of rush and uncertainty, and holding back all our plans for later, we all luckily made it through well within time (Again, part 3 confirms this was far from done). People also got accepted into the universities they desired. It was overall a pretty happy environment, but at the backend, it was a long process of providing moral support and holding each other‚Äôs back. But hey, that‚Äôs what friends do, right? That‚Äôs who you call friends.",
      "Finally, about the trips. For me, it blossomed late but in the most spectacular way imaginable. I embarked on adventures to Bithoor, Lucknow, and Goa (what a trip, definitely one for the books!) with CS buddies. Ayodhya, Rishikesh (fairly recent and utterly rejuvenating), and a Nepal trip with my wingies, Ooty and Shirdi with my family. But let me tell you about the thrill of Darjeeling and Sikkim! Scooting along the banks of the Teesta River, completely drenched in the rain, with the exhilarating thought that you could plummet off a cliff at any moment‚Äînow that‚Äôs what you call fun! Along with totally opposite Udaipur, a gem of a destination, explored with best people.¬† Unfortunately, a rookie mistake in selecting my graduation year as 2024 instead of 2023 in the Mitacs application (there are certain rules, you know) dashed my chance of visiting Canada. Instead of witnessing the majestic Aurora up North, I found myself enduring the scorching 50-degree summers in IITK (talk about a complete checkmate!). While I did get selected for Mitacs the following year, I had to choose BCG over it for the corporate experience.",
      "As the last semester unfolded, I chose to keep it fairly chill, sticking to the template and savoring every moment. I made new friends, played cricket like there was no tomorrow, had intense IPL discussions just like back in the good ol‚Äô days of 2016-17, experienced thrilling nightouts, and even dabbled in a bit of ghost hunting on top of ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô buildings. Life was just lifing at its absolute best. Amidst all the chaos, the stretched stay finally came to an end. It‚Äôs in these moments that you realize it‚Äôs not your achievements, but the people you‚Äôve earned along the way that matter the most. There‚Äôs a whole different world outside academics, and striking a delicate balance between the two is key.",
      "For me, these five years were a perfectly balanced blend of fun, challenges, amazements, academics, and mischievous adventures. It wasn‚Äôt too short due to Covid nor too long to become monotonous‚Äîit was just right. Peace! And this was supposed to be the ending of this AWL.",
      "Part 2 ‚Äì As an alum (Ab mai gyaan ch**unga!)",
      "This is where I will mention my opinions on certain things, and you can either agree, criticize, or suggest something better. Just bear in mind that this institute is for all of us, and I hope the future generations will strive to make it function better despite some flaws.",
      "I would like to begin by talking about CS while remaining neutral in my views and opinions. Firstly, a lot of people have problems with how CS handles the onboarding of first-year students. Some of the concerns are genuine, while others are driven by popular culture of being cool. The students are kept in H13/4, and they need proper interaction with their highly caring seniors, who only want them to mingle with the rest of IITK quickly. Yeah, very well.",
      "For once, try to think from the perspective of someone who has just entered adulthood, leaving their home for the first time, some even might get teary-eyed the night their parents leave (if you find this unusual, then I am sorry you aren‚Äôt familiar with the reality, and it‚Äôs great if it didn‚Äôt happen to you).",
      "As a student body itself, CS (the student side, not the other staff involved) has tried to maintain anonymity in many cases, and maybe that‚Äôs why you think ragging in today‚Äôs world is impractical and never happens after that infamous case. While I can understand the maturity of the third and fourth-year folks, you can‚Äôt argue that a second-year student, who might be excited about becoming a senior, is still new and might unknowingly cause serious damage. The ones allowed under the SG tag at least have some responsibility and accountability. And don‚Äôt worry, the culture we want to promote, though not all at once, is being promoted slowly in bits and pieces. You wouldn‚Äôt have received your DoPA on day 1 otherwise.",
      "CS, from the inside, has flaws, I agree. The people selected to represent it might not always be the best ones to do so, and sadly that is the case with the entire IITK. Show me a leader on whom everyone agrees. But as always, even if 75% of them tried their best, the tenure ends with a satisfied smile. However, I highly condemn SGs and CTMs who are so busy that they won‚Äôt have time in the future to connect with their mentees. For God‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt bother to be one. Focus on your other duties and PoRs; they will benefit your resume more.",
      "Lastly, I would like to point out that I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúpermanent people of CS‚Äù (you‚Äôll get this) are of much benefit to the internal or external functionality of CS. The unnecessary hindrance they provide and their dated opinions have done some harm to what could have been a smoothly functioning student body we all would have loved.",
      "Enough about CS, right? Alright. Another thing is trying your hands at research. Most of us are familiar with the usual career path, something we plan for even in our school years. But research (in something of your interest) is something for which you‚Äôll have to find your passion first. You won‚Äôt have a eureka moment, but what if something keeps you engaged even in your idle thoughts? Given how accessible it is here, try SURGE, do a UGP, or participate in a foreign research internship program. No one stops you from altering your usual path. Just think of it as a side mission that might become your main focus, and there‚Äôs no harm if it doesn‚Äôt. Now, I haven‚Äôt taken the research path myself, and you are not obliged to follow me here, but I have respect for it, and you know the future is uncertain. (Too uncertain, in my case, to be honest). Just please don‚Äôt switch to a dual degree out of mere interest. I know the institute, in promoting research, makes it easy for you to complete a dual degree, but trust me, an unmotivated fifth year can be cruel at times. Some can‚Äôt complete their thesis on time and get stuck; sometimes professors stretch it too, and you can‚Äôt complain (completely catastrophic). So be thoughtful in this case.",
      "Another thing, before a branch change or its other versions, try to explore your department as well. Who knows, you might fit and do better here compared to somewhere else, and this comes from personal experience. It‚Äôs okay if you find it uninteresting; at least you would be able to focus on things you actually like instead, rather than being clueless about your interests and jumping places following someone else‚Äôs path.",
      "Also, please be thoughtful about whom you idolize here (if you do). It‚Äôs good to choose a different path but never follow ‚Äòthat cool off-track senior‚Äô blindly. They are not much more mature, as I realize now. Don‚Äôt get swayed by someone‚Äôs polarized political opinions or why IITK is ruined and can‚Äôt be great again. It‚Äôs your campus; be respectful and create your own version of it. Even I wouldn‚Äôt say to agree with me here, it‚Äôs fine to have your say on something, but be humble enough to correct yourself if you are wrong. Enough of the lecture, right? Sorry!",

      "Part 3 ‚Äì Out of a million other possibilities‚Ä¶ (Aayein? Baigan!)",
      "This is the part I added later, and in my wildest dreams, I never thought this would happen. It‚Äôs a comic tragedy that shows you can‚Äôt do much if destiny has some lessons planned for you. Understandably, there‚Äôs a reason why Virat Kohli started putting Neem Karoli Baba‚Äôs picture as his wallpaper. Alright, sit back and relax.",
      "During placements, after the coding round and four interviews, I got an offer from ‚ÄòSpring‚Äô on Day 1.1, summing up my entire struggle of preparation. I was happy and satisfied. This led to a joyful last semester, during which many of us received mail from a company called ‚ÄòPrithvi Shaw‚Äô. As I wasn‚Äôt busy, I took their test. In the last week of our stay at IITK, we planned a wing trip to Rishikesh. During this trip, I received a call for an interview. I postponed it and gave the interview unprepared, thinking I had nothing to lose. The interview went mediocre, and I didn‚Äôt hear back, so it‚Äôs understandable they found a better candidate. Whatever, why would it worry me?",
      "Then, on May 31st, I was traveling to Bangalore to meet my sister and friends after a long time when I received a call. And as some of you may know, SPO informed me that my offer was revoked. This was a total shock. I became inactive and slept for 12 hours just to escape reality. It was a nightmare. I had casually wasted a pretty good opportunity earlier with Prithvi Shaw. When I woke up the next day, I tried to contact as many people as possible who could help me. And that‚Äôs why I say, you don‚Äôt make friends, you earn them.",
      "Without a laptop, I updated my resume on my mobile. I spent another night revising OS, Compilers, and Networks through my phone. I wasn‚Äôt able to hear anything from my parents; it was as if my outer senses had shut down. You may think I was making a big deal out of this, and I would have agreed if it hadn‚Äôt happened to me. I met my sister half-heartedly and gave an ML interview from a hotel room while my family visited Mysore Palace. Shortly after, I posted about the incident on LinkedIn.",
      "But my friends, SPO, alums, and other connections helped me a lot. This is something you reap while graduating from an institute like ours. I got good reach on LinkedIn and applied on many different lengthy portals. Next, I went to my friend‚Äôs place where almost all of us from the Y19 CS Core Team gathered, and I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful to them. They helped me with interviews, lifted my spirits, and eased my stress. We played FIFA, went go-karting during the day, and I prepared for interviews at night while playing poker. Although I slept very little, I prepared well in the short time I had.",
      "I applied to numerous places and got both positive and negative responses, even facing rejections in the final rounds. Finding an off-campus job in this recession was tough. Fortunately, thanks to many trials, a good resume and many referrals, I got good offers from some great places, and things were back on track. I accepted an offer from ‚ÄòCream7‚Äô (I expect you to get the reference) and went to Mumbai, as if destiny had it all planned. The End. Phew!",
      "‚ÄúWo camera me dekh ke haath hila dijiye, aapke sath prank hua hai,‚Äù life told me yet again. Just when I was about to join Cream7, I got a response from Spring saying they would like to reinstate my offer with a specified joining date. Wow, wtf! And the offer was better, along with a favorable location. So, I couldn‚Äôt deny it. Here‚Äôs the final update: I will hopefully be back to where I was supposed to be after a full circus of events. How I left Mumbai is yet another interesting story, but that‚Äôs for a different day. All I can say is that Cream7 had some of the best people, and they helped me a lot through the mishaps.",
      "So, what‚Äôs for the future? I don‚Äôt know, man; I can‚Äôt even predict at this point. But with whatever has happened, I can say that anything can happen without a surprise. So yes, just remember that life is never fair and always expect the unexpected. Peace!?",

      "In this 42th edition of As We Leave 2024, Kushagra Sharma, a Y20 student in the Department of Computer Science, shares with us his feelings about leaving campus. Read on to find out about his Rick and Morty adventures and to find many hidden references, which you‚Äôll either get or you won‚Äôt.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I‚Äôve just settled in my seat, the topmost corner of the middle column of L20 as I look at the TAs distributing the question paper. I grin ever so slightly, knowing that I had experienced their side of the spectrum as well. Just then, it hits me. This is my last endsem, the End-Endsem. The last time I will be sitting in L20 appearing for a paper. The last time I‚Äôll see so many heads seated with a seat‚Äôs gap between them, so very clearly not wanting to be there, waiting ever so urgently for the paper to get to them and so eagerly just wanting to get over it.‚ÄúGet Over IT?‚Äù I do not want to get over it. I do not want it to finish. Do I just get up and leave immediately so that it lasts just a little while longer? I wanted that so very badly, but alas, does anyone ever have the courage? And then it hits me like a truck. I start drowning in the waves of memories that I‚Äôve had over there: So many classes, so many sessions, the countless times we‚Äôve just hungout over there in the middle of the night, all the bittersweet memories as well: the intern interviews, the placement tests, multiple exams wherein I sat absolutely clueless as the weird symbols on the paper made no sense. And I zone out, trying to relive them all at once. The minutes pass, and I‚Äôm at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe a million miles away. My friend sitting beside me keeps glancing at me worriedly, probably thinking that I have no clue what to write in the paper. How do I make him realize the gravity of the situation we‚Äôre in? Luckily 40 minutes into the paper, a student is caught with his mobile, and the prof starts blabbering, breaking my trance. I look at the empty answer booklet lying in front of me and start writing my AWL.",
      "Okay, just kidding. I‚Äôve procrastinated over writing this so long that I‚Äôm actually ashamed of it. But if procrastination isn‚Äôt the best motivation, then what is? I‚Äôd rather not say when I‚Äôm writing this, but it is surprisingly close to 4:20 am.",
      "Sigh, I‚Äôm supposed to write my As We Leave, huh? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Who‚Äôd want to read an article containing a thousand crying emojis? That is practically what I did as I left. So imma just call this my ‚ÄúI‚Äôve left‚Äù and proceed to make an attempt to express how the journey left its mark on me. I feel that I‚Äôve chosen a particularly difficult topic to write about, and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôll turn out, but I‚Äôll do my best.",
      "I think anyone joining the college has enough motivation to ask around about academics, jobs and explore all the clubs of their interest, blah blah. But the college has so much more to offer, it makes you grow as a person. Think of us as Pokemons. If you‚Äôre willing to accept the changes, you can evolve into whatever you want.Now that you think that you‚Äôre a Pokemon, do you think that you want to evolve? Or do you think that you are the pinnacle of mankind, that you‚Äôve perfected everything there is? Do you fail to see all the people around you so clearly better in various aspects, having to offer so much to learn from? If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm afraid you are a really poor judge of human nature and will strongly recommend you to read all of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple in chronological order or perhaps go experience a canon-event(you know what I mean and no, I will not talk any further on this) that actually gives you a reality check.",
      "It will become quite abstract if I beat around the bush so I‚Äôd rather just tell what effect this journey had on me and will hope that you guys can get what I mean. As all the great pieces of art seem to have a non-linear plot, I will as well have to go back in time.",
      "‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù has been a million-dollar question for me. I have been nomadic and have been shifting from one place to another all my life. Fun, isn‚Äôt it? Perhaps so. Maybe not.Where do I call myself from?Do I say Rajasthan because somewhere in Rajasthan lies the family roots, where I have never been and don‚Äôt even remember the name? Or do I say Kolkata because I was born there and stayed there for five years, but I know no Bengali and don‚Äôt recall almost anything (Thank you Infantile Amnesia!)? Maybe Indonesia, where I spent most of my childhood and did practically all my schooling, but have since forgotten the language and am out of touch with most of the people I knew over there? Or do I call myself from Karnataka because of the couple of years I spent over there (No offense, but NO.)? Maybe I‚Äôm from Kota, where I felt ‚Äòat home‚Äô with the people over there for the first time (at least in a long time) and had as much fun as one could while preparing for JEE :/. Or do I call myself from Kanpur because I did my college from there (but Kanpur city? Seriously?)?",
      "A friend of mine rightly revealed to me that I suffer from an identity crisis. Since I myself don‚Äôt know where I belong, and telling all this is a long story, I just reply, ‚ÄúLong story‚Äù and cut the conversation short.",
      "Not very surprisingly, my outlook towards life became like a series of Rick and Morty adventures stitched together. Largely independent adventures with maybe a few callbacks to the previous ‚Äòepisodes‚Äô. I would never put in effort to get to know people, with the mindset that they‚Äôre somewhat ‚Äòside-quests‚Äô, since they‚Äôll only be a part of this adventure and be gone when I move to the next one. I‚Äôve seen a fairly decent number of kids who actually have this mindset. Mind me, this is not very evident, and it‚Äôs not like I knew this all along. I realized this amidst one of the sad-silent retrospectives when we‚Äôd started leaving campus.",
      "",
      "Anyways, even without my negative connotations, you should‚Äôve realized that this isn‚Äôt exactly an ideal outlook. You miss out on so much stuff that you don‚Äôt realize. Basically like speedrunning GTAV by completing all the main quests, and then you feel empty and disappointed after seeing 70% game completion after killing Trevor.",
      "You get to learn so much from the people around you. You might not know who you are or what you want to be when you enter college, but you can definitely have a pretty good idea of the person you‚Äôd want to be by incorporating all the W traits you find in the people in it. That person who taught you to not think twice and live life to the fullest. That person whose way of talking you absolutely adore. That person who has a pretty similar sense of humor, and you have a blast with them. That person who has a pretty dissimilar sense of humor, and you find out that that‚Äôs pretty humorous as well. That person who is so easy to have around just for who they are, and you try to pick up cues as to why that is. That person who makes you realize that life isn‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows and that you need to give hate where hate is due. That person, who y0u met really late, who made you realize how much fun you‚Äôd used to have in that hobby (How badly I wanted to write Dobby instead) of yours you‚Äôd given up. That person, after talking to whom you realize how much impact one-on-one conversations can/should have. That absolutely fun person to have around who overdoes it in group settings just to try and become part of one? Obviously, all the stuff you see won‚Äôt be a W. You‚Äôll find a lot of L stuff as well.",
      "The parting speech the professor gave in my last UG class was absolutely beautiful. She said that we as a generation have become so cynical that being cynical is considered cool. I couldn‚Äôt agree more (Definitely do a course under Suchitra Ma‚Äôam!). We‚Äôre so quick to judge and find faults with the people around us that we usually don‚Äôt give them enough credit for who they are. You‚Äôll probably make a very big list of the L stuff you see around you, but do try to keep an open outlook and have some sort of ‚ÄòUtopian Vision‚Äô. At any rate, as long as you‚Äôre able to categorize into whatyouthink is W/L, you should be good. Doesn‚Äôt quite matter all that much how you do that as long as you do. One could argue that Walter White became Heisenberg because he got diagnosed with cancer, or one can claim that cancer just surfaced Heisenberg out of Walter. Potato, Potahto.So maybe the next time someone asks me ‚ÄòWhere are you from?‚Äù, I‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúIITK‚Äù because it has given me so much that I‚Äôll carry a part of the people I‚Äôve known forever with me. Should I have to care that the person (asking me where I‚Äôm from) does not take me for an arrogant and boastful guy who got into IIT? Little would they know the significance it has had in my life.",
      "Sigh, this might sound very complicated, but it isn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt have to actively put in effort all the time. If you‚Äôre open to learning and hearing people out, this wouldn‚Äôt be as daunting as it seems.",
      "At any rate, the best one-liner advice I could give is to not restrict yourself a lot and be open to all the new experiences. This is the best time. As Calvin rightly said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never enough time to do all the nothing you want‚Äù, or perhaps how John Wick said, ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù.",
      "",
      "Speaking of John Wick, I will say that I have rambled on quite a lot as compared to monosyllabic responses. This is currently at 1688 words and an 8 minutes and 26 seconds reading time (Reference:https://niram.org/read/), which is a lot more than what I thought it would be and definitely a lot more than most of your attention span (Maybe I should thank you if you‚Äôve made it till here).",
      "",
      "Anyways, Imma head back to my TV now. As I head back towards the sofa after putting on Rick and Morty, I glance at the Lord of the Rings lying on the table beside it, wherein Merry and Pippin desperately beg for me to revive a fraction of my old reading habit(habbit?) to come rescue them. I slump back into the sofa, watch Rick and Morty for exactly 2 minutes and 17 seconds before taking out my phone and scrolling reels, sincerely hoping that this text touches at least a few of you.",

      "I‚Äôm not sure whether this AWL should be just me spilling every single drop of tea about my college life, or whether it should be dark and mysterious, like a video game made by a certain Miyazaki. Truth is, I feel like someone just asked me to sayabsolutely anythingin my native language ‚Äì I seem to not be able to remember anything! So, forgive me, but this AWL will probably read like a 2013 MLG compilation ‚Äì lots of jump cuts, zero cohesion, an unhealthy number of obscure references and inside jokes, and a feeling like you‚Äôve just read someone recall a fever dream (which, frankly, isn‚Äôt far off the mark!)",
      "In any case, this is how it happened. This is how I survived.",
      "Year 1",
      "‚ÄúOkay, so the first night is never usually that bad in any of the games, so I‚Äôll play through-‚Äú-Mark ‚ÄúMarkiplier‚Äù Fischbach, 2018",
      "If you know where the quote is from, you know exactly how my year went. The first year wouldn‚Äôt be THAT bad, would it? Sure, we have to stay home for a year and a half because someone felt like bat soup was a good idea, but at least I can learn from my laptop and interact with the greatest young minds of India, right?",
      "All those hypotheses were technically correct ‚Äì the best kind of correct. I did find the most amazing people here, multitalented, incredibly intelligent ‚Äì except they were all as big of a goofball and unserious as me. The interactions were not what I expected them to be ‚Äì in a good way.",
      "The fever dream started with a call from my SG, which was followed by a meeting with him and 5 other equally excited people, who eventually turned into actualbhaisfor the next few years. Where I expected sophistication and formality, at least in the beginning, I found the most offensive jokes at others‚Äô expense, zoom calls at ungodly hours filled with bellowing laughter, and a place to vent about our professors (looking at nobody in particular.mth101/2).",
      "The people from college I met first were my fellow Malayalees. In a way, my IITK journey started in Kochi, not Kanpur. We were as tightly knit as we could be (like Malayalees anywhere) and they provided a sense of familiarity in a place so foreign. For the next few years, these would be the people with whom I would celebrate festivals I would usually celebrate with my family; the ones I would go to for help in my courses, or to just take a break from speaking Hindi, to be honest. They still remain the most welcoming and helpful bunch of people at IITK.",
      "A decision that set a major course for the rest of the college life was joining the Debating Society in the first year. Under the pretext of debating, we had so many 3 am sessions sharing memes on call instead of discussing what we were screaming at each other for for the past 2 hours. These people would indeed become my main support system at IITK, the people I‚Äôd go to whenever I was in dire need of someone to lend a metaphorical ear or a physical shoulder to cry on.",
      "I remember the long sessions Karan and I had on Discord, laughing our lungs out on the most nonsensical things we could say just because we didn‚Äôt want to leave the call; the huge roar in the zoom meeting when Shreya got her first break (think ‚Äúqualified for the final rounds‚Äù for you non debaters); the call Akanksha gave me when we broke in a tournament‚Ä¶ all a breath of fresh air, compared to the feeling of being stuck in one place for so long (both physically in my room, and the drone of academics).",
      "What did I learn in my first year? I‚Äôd say that I realized there was a LOT of work I had to do to become better for the people I cared about, and to become better for myself. The transition from the stoic, emotionless Agent 47-esque person to someone who could contemplate vulnerability, grapple with conflicting emotions, or make difficult decisions impacting the happiness of the ones I cared about, was, needless to say, challenging. But it was necessary. Closing your heart to things is the coward‚Äôs way out. Open your heart to it. Let yourself be hurt.",

      "‚ÄúWe‚Äù was a group we were too lazy to name. Originally a group to discuss ESC101, it evolved into Harshul, Sanika and I helping each other through the academic nightmare of EE DCs and ensuring we were all awake for the 8 AM endsems. Watching lectures together was the only way we could finish at least one in a single sitting.",
      "Sanika was actually the first friend I met on campus, after a long, only slightly scary journey from Kerala to UP. The campus was beautiful and overwhelmingly large. After the adrenaline rush of leaving home wore off, however, the freezing cold began to hit. This was one of the many things that led to my second year becoming arguably my worst year in college.",
      "I entered a relationship I wasn‚Äôt remotely ready for, I fell victim to clinical depression, and academics were as unforgiving as ever. On top of all this, the isolation I put myself through, the inability to effectively share my feelings with those around me really took its toll on me. Getting steamrolled with EE210 and ESO203 was just icing on the cake. But hey, I got antidepressants, finally!",
      "I say ‚Äúarguably‚Äù my worst year because a lot of things went right this semester too. I finally experienced what it feels like to be cared for by someone outside your family, I started to make progress on bettering myself, breaking thought patterns and becoming kinder to myself. At the expense of a few grades and a little bit of my sanity, I figured out the person I wanted to be.",

      "This year, I made some cool new friends ‚Äì Gaurang ,who weirdly looks like me, and Soham, who does not. These are the people I still vibe with so much, be it the equally broken humor we share, or our love for video games. I also started getting the hang of courses again, with a newfound interest in my departmental courses. Not everything was hunky-dory though, I was having a rough time recovering from depression, and the scrambled mess the previous year had made me, took a lot of effort to put back together.",
      "This was really made worse by the stress of the¬† intern drive, a sentiment shared by many of my friends as well. The stress of academics, internship prep, tests, interviews, rejections brought me to my knees, and by the time I finally got an internship at NVIDIA, I was heavily bruised, battered, and deep fried.",
      "In the end, things worked out for the best. My grades improved, and I had SO much fun in my internship. I finally figured out what I wanted to do with my career. The new people, the new environment in Bengaluru, all¬† made me hopeful for the future again, and it is with this sentiment we go into the climax of my IITK experience.",
      "Year 4",
      "‚ÄúHesitation is Defeat‚Äù-Isshin Ashina, in ‚ÄúSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äù",
      "Soham convinced me to download this game called Sekiro, this quote from which became the theme of my final year. Everything was set, with the PPO from NVIDIA, and like Logic‚Äôs discography, the pressure finally went away. I had one goal this year: to go out with a bang. To not hesitate to do anything, whether it was to accrue knowledge like a mad scientist, to annoy my friends into hanging out with me or to just show up at their doorstep unannounced, to do the most with my time here, which was quickly running out.",
      "As a result, this year was the most fun I‚Äôve had in the longest time. The courses I had taken up were hard, but extremely fulfilling; the fun I had with all my friends ‚Äì going to pronites, getting KFC for no reason other than getting KFC, going on a trip to Dharamshala and having the time of my life with the best people there ‚Äì the list goes on.I finally learnt to enjoy my own company (well, to an extent, at least), finally explored the campus, went on late night cycle joyrides, finished Sekiro thrice, and so on.",
      "I reconnected with DebSoc, which had evolved tremendously in the time I was away. I went to Madras with a bunch of clever juniors (shoutout Om, Praanshu, Shivanshu, Aniket and Siddharth) and we bagged an inter-IIT gold there ‚Äì SO MUCH happened this year, just because I learned to live a little more and worry a little less.",
      "This is exactly what I want to tell you, my dear reader. Stop worrying so much. Stop caring about things not under your control, and stop worrying about being wrong. We are sometimes so caught up in trying to be right that we forget to be happy. And while I do realize I have as much wisdom as the tooth that the dentist tore out of my gums a few weeks ago, I‚Äôd still advise you to be less serious about things. The world is a funny place, and it only makes sense that you have a laugh at it sometimes. You cannot afford to be stuck in cycles of negativity, doubt, and isolation if you want to thrive. To have a better college life, the cycle must end here. You must be better.",
      "Bonus Chapter: Home",
      "‚ÄúFarewell, good hunter. May you find your worth in the waking world.‚Äù-The Doll, ‚ÄúBloodborne‚Äù",
      "I came back home for the first time in 4 months, after college ended and I said my goodbyes to the ones closest to me and a few professors who genuinely impacted my life for the better. I now spend a LOT of time on my PS5, and while I‚Äôm glad to be home, I miss the freedom I had in college, to wake up at 3 pm, to take a bath at 2 am without anyone getting disturbed, to enjoy time with myself alone, away from the prying eyes of others. I am glad college is over, yet there is something so weirdly charming about the place that painfully whittled you and the people around you down into the beings you are today, about collective suffering and joy that brings people together. What is a home if you can‚Äôt simultaneously have the best and the worst times of your life there? What is a home without love, and what is love without struggle?",
      "On the bright side, at least it isn‚Äôt 50 degrees in here.",

      "In this 40th edition of¬† As We Leave 2024, Shashwat Gupta, a Y20 student from the Department of Computer Science, shares the stories and lessons he has gathered from his time at IITK. He reflects on the challenges and triumphs of juggling academics, ambition, and adventure.",

      "[Author] Disclaimer: the timeline of some events might be messed up, especially in 1st and 2nd year, since I don‚Äôt specifically recall the exact dates of events.",
      "This article was originally published here :https://medium.com/@shashwat.gpt/iitk-chartering-unknown-my-journey-end-to-end-at-iit-kanpur-e748bd7d90e3",

      "",
      "Joyous atmosphere on result declaration when I got 603 AIR. Though I was a bit disappointed since I was expecting a CS rank in top 5 IITs, I was soon in revel by the merry that coachings do. Researched options and found out that the best place for higher ed and most options of studying CS in IIT Kanpur (branch change with many get 10/10), double major or even minors). Also proximity with home in Lucknow, enabled me to choose IIT Kanpur. Talked to a senior Nirmal, who really encouraged me to join IIT Kanpur. He even mentored me throughout in my journey. After a talk with a lot of seniors, I got to know that in rest of IITs, it like 1 or 2 people get 10/10 in 1st year, whereas in Kanpur, there is a better chance since 5-6 people get 10/10. (later I was able to prove my decision right).",
      "I also finished MTH101 (Professor Shunmukharaj‚Äôs notes) syllabus and ESC101 syllabus before joining IIT Kanpur in the gap between JEE Advanced and joining IIT Kanpur. Though it was really hard to have worked for 2 years, and starting off 2 courses without rest. That really helped since these were the toughest subjects for aspirants. Being from ICSE Board, coding felt easy for me and the majority of the ESC101 thing I had already studies in my class 10th and higher classes. Both these things, along with the fact that I used to do a lot of drawing-sketching in my early school days helped me get a branch change later on.",
      "First thing I found was a message from my Senior Bhagwat Garg (my Bapu, and currently SDE @ Samsung Korea) and 5 bhais : Harbeer Gurjar, Harshit K Tiwari, Vaibhav Goyal, Vishal Meena. The mentorship and the bolding was amazing and helped me settle into the IIT Kanpur culture. Though there were challenges in interaction, online mode of interaction had their own perks : easy grading, attending no classes (putting on the meet and leaving) and enabled me to join a lot of clubs.¬† I became a part of Entrepreneurship Cell (ECell), BCS (Brain and Cognitive Society), Student‚Äôs Opinion Society (SOS; now PPOC), Pclub. (Programming Club). Still, I always kept academics as prime focus, since I had selected IIT Kanpur for its ease of branch change.",
      "During my time at college, I matured significantly and formed strong friendships. Together, we participated in Riwayat, where I co-founded a telemedicine startup called XpertCare. We even pitched it to an investor and secured funding. However, due to low interest and tough competition from major players in the south, we eventually abandoned the project. Nonetheless, I continued to work on my entrepreneurial skills and later founded HealthPredict, a startup I ran from 2020 to early 2024, gaining invaluable mentorship along the way.",
      "In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I enjoyed participating in various events such as Freshers Bollyweek, MClub music classes, and Techweek. These experiences were both fun and enlightening, helping me discover my strengths and weaknesses.",
      "At the end of my first year, I successfully switched my major to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at IIT Kanpur. This justified my choice of college, and I was thrilled to win the Prateek Mishra Award for the highest CPI in Electrical Engineering (EE), thanks to the guidance of mentors Nirmal and Bhagwat.",
      "I also ran for a position in the Y20 batch elections. Out of 17 candidates, I placed 9th, just missing the opportunity to become a senator by a few votes. Although it was a slight disappointment, I eventually achieved this goal in my fourth year, crossing it off my long-standing list of unfulfilled wishes.",
      "Despite the transition to the CSE department, which was more competitive and fragmented, I fondly remember the strong sense of community and camaraderie in the EE department. The bonds I formed there felt like family, making it bittersweet to leave that supportive environment.",
      "After transitioning to the CSE department, I felt a renewed sense of freedom to explore various clubs and activities I had set aside in my early years. With six courses on my plate, I also joined six different clubs:",
      "Achieving the highest marks in the mid-semester of ESO207 initially gave me a sense of complacency, leading me to relax and devote more time to club activities. However, this shift in focus resulted in a B in ESO207 after the end-semester exams, breaking my streak of 10-pointers. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: no matter how well you perform initially, consistent effort is crucial to maintain your position, as there‚Äôs always someone ready to take your place.",
      "Amidst all this activity, I received the exciting news that I had become the SG, the first in my family to achieve this honor.",
      "Continuing with six clubs while managing demanding CSE courses was a formidable challenge. Achieving high grades in CSE courses is notoriously tougher than in non-CSE subjects. Balancing my role as a club secretary with six rigorous courses proved to be difficult. Despite my efforts, I found myself only achieving average results across my endeavors. The pressure was immense, prompting me to seek support from Ms. Aradhana, the department counselor.",
      "Through my sessions with Ms. Aradhana, which continued through semesters 4 and 5, I learned valuable lessons in time management and maintaining a humane approach to life. I realized the importance of not overloading myself and only taking on what I could handle comfortably.",
      "One memorable course was CS253, which highlighted the significance of team dynamics and interpersonal relationships in group work. This experience taught me the importance of having friends and valuing interpersonal skills.",
      "While applying to ECell, I faced a setback during the interview, where I struggled with questions on startups, ECell knowledge, and adaptability. Despite not succeeding, I learned valuable lessons and applied them in future interviews.",
      "A positive highlight was my summer project with Professor Ashutosh Modi on Indian Sign Language recognition, which led to a paper published at EMNLP 2022 in Abu Dhabi. This project, part of the SURGE program, involved collaboration with S Pradeep, Priya Gole, and Abhinav Joshi. Although I couldn‚Äôt attend the conference due to a commitment to a Systems Winter-School at IIT Delhi, the experience was enriching, and I gained invaluable guidance from Professor Modi and Abhinav Joshi.",
      "Over the summer, I prepared for internships, focusing on Adobe Research and quant roles. My preparation included DSA from LeetCode, Striver sheets, and quant puzzle books.",
      "I also applied for a semester exchange abroad and was fortunate to be selected, alongside Ayush Kumar and Vineet Sinha. This opportunity was an exciting prospect for my academic and personal growth.",
      "Semester kicked off with excitement for Exchange at EPFL and a bit stress for internship. After giving many exams, I got 2 offers in Day 2. A systems role at APT (an HFT) and ML research role at Adobe. Though it was hard for me, I let go of APT offer to join Adobe. Later on, I left Adobe to pursue Exchange at EPFL.",
      "This semester with core course of Operating System was a big hard. Furthermore the grading was bad for everyone doing that course. Rumours say that some events on the CSE research day led to the bad grading, but upto the juniors to dig deep into them üòä",
      "As head of Brain and Cognitive Society (not BCS Club), I took a lot of initiatives. We had planned from day 1 to convert this to a club. I did a ‚ÄòSentiment Analysis‚Äô project which had one of the highest completion rate and was taken by juniors and seniors alike. There were other collaborations such as with researchers, and professors from CGS Department. There were winter projects as well as some amazing secretary level projects.",
      "I got to explore cognitive sciences, and ended up doing a minor in it. Furthermore, a lot of effort was put in to find apt courses for which I could get a credit waiver at EPFL Exchange abroad.",
      "Also, with Rishabh and Mohit, I started LearnHCI Group, which later on became the ACM SIGCHI IITKanpur Student Chapter. Unfortunately, I left for exchange and Mohit-Rishabh graduated, so the things stalled till my 7th semester.",
      "I also got a chance to attend Winter School on Cloud and Security at IIT Delhi along with my seniors Shorya and Tejesh. The school was amazing and gave us deep insights into what lay ahead in these 2 domains. It was really hard to keep up with the pace of the curriculum. We also explored the Delhi and the various bizarre things it had to offer us.",
      "I started to attend 1 month of IIT Kanpur classes until my Visa got confirmed.",
      "Another interesting update was that since December I was working on High Prep Dev Rev Problem Statement. I had worked on the statement from December till end of January; after which I had to leave for Semester abroad. Despite me not being present in the InterIIT Ceremony in February, we were able to secure silver medal in the InterIIT Problem Statement.",
      "My semester exchange at EPFL was a transformative experience. I discovered that it wasn‚Äôt just about academics or leisure but a balanced mix of both. Europe‚Äôs focus on work-life balance allowed me to excel academically while exploring the Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and France, enriching my life in many ways.",
      "The application process for EPFL was straightforward, with the Office of International Relations at IIT Kanpur guiding us. I applied for the spring semester at the end of August and received confirmation by late September. Planning my courses was crucial, as they needed to align with IITK‚Äôs curriculum to ensure I could receive credit waivers. This careful strategizing paid off, allowing me to maintain my academic trajectory.",
      "The exchange broadened my cultural perspective as I met people from diverse backgrounds, enhancing my resume with significant research experience. Despite the high costs and challenges like cooking my meals and a housing scam, the journey was rewarding. It taught me the importance of diligence and preparation, making it a memorable chapter in my academic career.",
      "I have covered my detailed experience of Semester Exchange at EPFL here:https://medium.com/@guptashashwatme/research-at-epfl-my-journey-as-an-exchange-student-at-europes-leading-cs-university-280e3ebfe4db",
      "Also, my friend Aayush Kumar, who went along with us, has shared his experience here:https://medium.com/@ug_anc/embracing-global-opportunities-aayush-kumars-semester-at-epfl-66e0e854da3f",
      "Thanks Aayush and Vinit for sharing the sentiment of ‚Äòbeing homeless in a foreign land‚Äô.",
      "Semester 7 again started off with excitement for placement preparation. After my research aborad experience, I had made my mind to go into a brand-name MNC. I had already a good level of preparation of DSA and Quant from the intern prep, now all that remained was to revise and enhance.",
      "Unluckily, I was diagnosed with Dengue and typhoid, and missed all tests from November 1st to November 22nd , during which duration I was hospitalised. Missing Google, Microsoft and other quant tests was heartbreaking then. Nonetheless, I managed to give and succeed in a lot of tests.",
      "I got placed on Day 1 after 8 interviews. With 2 offers from Navi and PwC, I decided to join PwC, as Associate Product and Technology. Choosing PwC over Navi was again a hard decision, since the Navi was offering 3x the package of PwC, but after careful thought, and consulting with people I regard as my ‚Äòmentors‚Äô, I took the plunge.",
      "Towards my research work, I got to explore the beautiful domain of Audio and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) ML under professor Vipul Arora.",
      "I was also the TA of the courses ESC111 and ESC112. I had always attended classes as being a student, but being on the other side helped me understand the processes, the expectations and grow in general.",
      "Luckily I got 10/10 in this semester; which was surprising for me after all the chaos filled semester.",
      "I continued to work on building ACM SIGCHI IIT Kanpur Student Chapter. I am writing a detailed blog on the journey of founding the ACM SIGCHI Chapter, and possible future student clubs here:https://medium.com/@shashwat.gpt/building-the-acm-sigchi-chapter-at-iit-kanpur-insights-challenges-and-opportunities-a3f4710a1132",
      "For my peers, this semester was chill. But since I went for exchange, I had a few extra courses, including the dreaded compilers.",
      "Towards research work, I (along with L. Gokulnath) got to understand the beautiful world of Computer Vision under Professor Priyanka Bagade.",
      "Also, I closed my startup : HealthPredict and thought to try out my career at VC. I joined a small VC firm : Triton Ventures and got to learn a lot in the SaaS and cybersecurity industry.",
      "Furthermore, by the end of semester, I had already established ACM SIGCHI Club. We have also completed a good number of projects.",
      "A lot of opportunities in IIT Kanpur. Especially there is a fund of min. 50 lakh available for every idea that you can pursue. When I became the Y20 senator, I was trying to pass something related to gymkhana that all student funding be made public and 1 platform to track them. This way student‚Äôs money will be used for students. Right now what is happening is that people outside of IITK and the people in-charge of giving the money make teams to give the amount.",
      "Always give priority to:",
      "I think 3rd should be kept over 2 because your peers define you (you are the average of 5 closest people), where as grades and resume are a subset of manifestation of who you are. IIT Kanpur made me realise the importance of friend in life; which I feel is the single biggest learning for me.",
      "There are no right decisions. Also decisions are never evaluated based on the outcome since the importance or right/wrong is at the point where you are making it. What worked best for me was to take ample time to research and then once it is made, try to make it right, with an acceptance of possible failure in heart. Ratan Tata said ‚ÄúI do not believe in making the right decisions, I believe in making decision and them proving them right‚Äù",
      "Its important to try a lot of things and also to fail early on.",
      "On trying a lot of things, once you try something first hand, you have an in-depth experience of things, which no reading or no chat with a person can provide. In cognitive sciences, this is called degree of representation. Failure (not getting what you had started the endeavours for and/or settling for something lesser) teacher much more than succeeding at anything can. Also, make as many mistakes as possible, just never repeat the same mistake. And, through my little life, I have realised that failure are a blessing in disguise : they help you push forward, and many times they are a sign: often I have failed at some things, left them and later on reflected that leaving that pursuit was the best thing I could do.",
      "A good hack: I make a bucket of ‚Äúunfullfilled wishes‚Äù. Whenever I get time in life, I pursue those things. It helps me in 2 ways : first always gives me some goal. Secondly, it helps me sacrifice or forego immediate things, with an assurance that no matter how mature I become, or how things turn out, the things that I want to do will not get lost.",
      "Acknowledgements:Thank you to Manya from the Y23 batch and the Vox Populi Team for assisting me in sharing my story. While writing AWL, I groped for precious details, reflections and photos, that could have been lost. I will forever be grateful to loving seniors who have mentored me from child to mature (‚Äòbaapu‚Äô, ‚Äòchachu‚Äô, ‚Äòdaddu‚Äô sab ko dhayawaad). I thank my peers for being my competitors and my support at the same time. I also thank my teachers for their invaluable contribution to shaping who I am.",

      "In this 39th edition of As We Leave 2024, Siddhartha Pratap Singh, a Y19 student in the Department of Chemistry, takes us through some stories and some learnings he has taken away from his experience at IITK. He gives us some bits of gyaan and some interesting ways to look at what life throws at you",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Before starting this As We Leave or AWL, I wish to put out this disclaimer. Whatever I‚Äôll mention, is my personal opinion. I don‚Äôt want to use words like ‚ÄúI think‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccording to me‚Äù throughout. Subjectivity is implicit, so please take note while reading.",
      "‚ÄúGround Control to Major TomTake your protein pills and put your helmet on (ten)Ground Control to Major Tom (nine, eight, seven, six)Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three, two)Check ignition, and may God‚Äôs love be with you (two, one, blastoff)‚Äù",
      "Writing an AWL wasn‚Äôt such a clear-cut decision for me. Last year was supposed to be my final year at IITK and I planned to write an AWL back then but didn‚Äôt think I had anything worthwhile to say. Much has changed since then and now I am ready to frame it into words. I guess many of the readers won‚Äôt know me. I was never the outgoing type nor did I ever interact outside my social circles. So let me get the introductions out of the way.",
      "I‚Äôm Siddhartha, a Y19 degree extended student. I feel a need to make something clear, right at the start. My goal here is not to garner sympathy. I consider this like some personal exercise as I try to conceptualize my stay at IITK and what it meant. You should keep this in mind as you read along and take whatever I say with a grain of salt.",
      "So, all good stories have a purpose and the same is true for an AWL. I had multiple ideas on where to go with this and have decided to steer clear of some stuff. Firstly, this won‚Äôt be a chronological list of events as that won‚Äôt interest most readers. Secondly, I won‚Äôt be talking about certain aspects of college life such as Academics and Career. Those are a matter of your own hard work, some luck factor and you‚Äôre better off getting advice from those more academically inclined than me.",
      "The things that I want to talk about are more general. An AWL acts as a way to look into someone‚Äôs life at IITK and understand what they got out of it, what lessons they have learned, and what mistakes they made. This is in line with what I believe the goal of an AWL should be and what we were told by our Y18 seniors about the AWL of the then-graduating Y15 batch. The goal of all of this is to better oneself and I‚Äôll be touching on some relevant events.",
      "‚ÄúRiders on the stormInto this house, we‚Äôre bornInto this world, we‚Äôre thrownLike a dog without a boneAn actor out on loanRiders on the storm‚Äù",
      "There is a deeply concerning trend that I see in junior batches. I know it‚Äôs become a running joke when we say, ‚ÄúJuniors are killing the culture of IITK‚Äù, but stay with me on this. More and more I have seen that people on campus won‚Äôt do things unless they get some benefit out of it. Before they join any club, the students think about what useful skills they may extract from here and based on this they decide whether they‚Äôll join or not. This, however, is not a new phenomenon as it was happening during our first year as well.",
      "Just like most freshers, I went to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù the various clubs during the first semester. Due to some expectations from myself, I decided to join the Dramatics Club and did the freshers nukkad in Dram Eve 1. I later realized that these expectations were deeply misguided but we‚Äôll get to that later. One day during our practice sessions, the Y17 seniors of the club asked the freshers a question, ‚ÄúWhy did you all join Drams and not some other club?‚Äù. Most of us gave the same answers like ‚ÄúI want to improve my speaking skills‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want to gain confidence‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to speak better in public‚Äù. If you look at the answers, you can see this is the result of looking at the clubs through the aforementioned lens of ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù. All of these are skills that will help one professionally and socially and that‚Äôs how we were justifying joining Drams.",
      "After hearing from us, the Y17s had something interesting to say, ‚ÄúAll these are skills that you can learn by joining any club. All clubs take public lectures, workshops, and many more. Why did you join Drams specifically?‚Äù. In hindsight, this was a pretty obvious explanation. We also realized what they wanted to hear from us and we were told the correct answer to the original question, ‚ÄúI like acting or want to act‚Äù.",
      "I didn‚Äôt realize this back then but I didn‚Äôt like acting the same way others did. Also, I wasn‚Äôt that good at it. We are told that enthu is the only thing you need but enthu can only get you so far. Yes, you can work hard enough to excel at something but not all things would get the same result. Sometimes the energy is better spent on things you‚Äôre more natural at or those you actually like doing. This is where being at a college like IITK helps, you have many chances to fail. It‚Äôs not like the outside world where you have to work a job, even if you don‚Äôt like it. Here at least you have the option to not do something if it only brings you anxiety. You should use this opportunity to ‚Äúfind yourself‚Äù i.e find answers for who you are and what you want. This was the motivation I needed to leave Drams which I eventually did around Antaragni practice.",
      "This is not an easy task, ‚Äúfinding yourself‚Äù, and you may stray from the path many times. Sometimes you may do things out of peer pressure. Maybe your wingies are applying for fest secy and you think you should apply too because you don‚Äôt want to miss out on things. I also did similar things just because my wingies were doing it. I interviewed for the AnC council for a Secy position (got rejected) and also for Student Guide (got accepted) but this is not how it should be. The desire to explore should come from yourself. You shouldn‚Äôt do these things under coercion or duress. Most freshers go through the ordeal of Galaxy and Takneek. I also did as I rejoined Drams during Galaxy, having nothing better to do but that was not a smart decision. I could have dedicated that time to some other club that could have used my skills better.",
      "As you explore you will eventually find the fun in things. As that happens, the idea of ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù will vanish as being in that space brings you joy. That‚Äôs why you should try to explore as much as possible and as fast as possible. That will bring you the maximum amount of joy. However, I don‚Äôt think of this as a dealbreaker. Sometimes things may go under your radar when you go out exploring the various entities. What should you do then? This happened to me in the case of Quiz Club.",
      "I knew about QC as one of my wingies, Mantaas, and a friend, Sanskar, were avid quizzers and both became QC secys. I was not part of many quiz club activities during the first year due to being focused on Drams. I attended 2-3 quizzes in the first year but then COVID happened. My next interaction with QC wouldn‚Äôt be until the 6th semester. It was a collaborative event with QC to host a Video Game Quiz and this was my proper introduction to quizzing.",
      "From summer onwards, I went to more and more quizzes with my wingies and other friends, having done more than 15 quizzes and hosted a Music Quiz Club with a couple of Y22s. Now, this experience was way better when compared to my experience in Drams. I say this having nothing but respect for Drams. I have been a fan of their performances for a long time and still attend every event if I can. However, I simply believe I was a better fit here in Quiz Club than I ever was in Drams. Due to a lifestyle surrounded by pop culture and random facts, quizzing came more naturally to me. Looking back now, I wish I had joined it sooner. Still, I had enough fun for it to be worth writing about.",
      "I wanted to bring this point up because my first consistent interaction with the QC started in the 4th year. What I mean to say is, you can always find fun new things. What you may do is try to find some time, set some boundaries (as you will not be able to do everything), and do as much as you can. So whenever you are bored or just want to try something out, get out there. There is a wealth of opportunities. Join the Adventure Club and go on a trek, join the Photography Club for one of their workshops or you can even join Drams if you actually like acting and give commendable performances. You can have fun by just trying out a new club. Just hit up any coordi or secy, they would be eager to help you. And isn‚Äôt this the reason why we call them clubs and not companies? They are there to socialize, be part of a community, and just have fun with people who like the same things as you.",
      "‚ÄúThe highway‚Äôs jammed with broken heroesOn a last chance power driveEverybody‚Äôs out on the run tonightBut there‚Äôs no place left to hide‚Äù",
      "As far back as I can remember, I was always obsessed with Video Games. The memories may have blurred but they are still there. My gaming journey started around the age of 4 and I was lucky enough to have gotten such an early exposure to games. Playing games like Contra or Mario on a bootleg console or PC games like Mortal Kombat 4 and House of the Dead was all we did in the summers or whenever the cable got disconnected. As time went on and we got broadband, it was like the floodgates were opened. I was able to learn so much about the history of the industry, various gaming consoles, famous franchises, and so on. I played scores of games and eventually, I learned about Game Development and how outside of India, it was a viable career option for many. That‚Äôs when I decided, I wanted to be a Game Developer.",
      "When I joined IITK, there was nothing related to GameDev, but as fate would have it, the Game Development Society was formed just before COVID. Sometime later, the secy form was out and I filled it the first chance I got. I gave my secy interview with zero experience in GameDev or Game Design, only having a low-end PC from 2011. My only saving grace was that I was a gamer and my entire secy interview was just me and the founders (Mayant Mukul and Sugam Srivastava, I owe it all to them) discussing games such as Super Metroid and Fallout: New Vegas and design concepts in them. By some chance, I got selected as secy and that is how the GameDev journey began.",
      "When I started doing GameDev, I realized some things. First, I really liked this thing i.e. if given the option to sit in a room and just to do game development for years, I would do so. This was what I mentioned when talking about clubs. Second, I was actually good at this. This is another thing that I mentioned when I talked about Drams. If you think something gives you joy, but you are not good at it, after some time it won‚Äôt. You would be forcing yourself to do it. This was what I felt was different for me and GameDev.",
      "During COVID, when there was no surety of campus reopening or even when the next semester would start, I just spent 10-12 hours a day creating games. That was how the rest 8 months of 2020 went for me. This also pushed me to apply for Group Leader in the club. I got selected and I must say the tenure as leader was such a wonderful time. The time in the council was fun as I already knew many people there such as my wingies, Panshul and Shivam, and some folks from the hall like Gurbaaz and Saad. I also found great friends in the other Y19 leaders and in the Y20 secys, many of whom I consider more of a friend than a junior.",
      "Once you have found something similar to what I found in GameDev, you should then focus on prioritizing. This would be your personal decision and you should prioritize things based on how much you can sacrifice. If you are okay with putting all of your time into this one thing, then that‚Äôs up to you. This was the same reason I had and also why I didn‚Äôt join any other club or fest team. I thought my time was better spent working on making games than someplace else like Team Antaragni doing god knows what for a fest that I wasn‚Äôt even interested in. This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt explore anymore. I did QC in my 4th year when I became free of the club responsibilities in GameDev. However, I still believe that the best time to explore is your first year only. By the second year, your time is better spent on specializing and setting boundaries on what you‚Äôre doing.",
      "‚ÄúWhat would you think if I sang out of tune?Would you stand up and walk out on me?Lend me your ears and I‚Äôll sing you a songAnd I‚Äôll try not to sing out of keyOh, I get by with a little help from my friends?‚Äù",
      "Taking a detour, I wanted to talk about the most important part of campus culture which resonated with me, i.e. ‚Äúwing culture‚Äù. This and the ‚ÄúSG-Baccha‚Äù culture is something that goes a long way toward connectivity in this harsh campus environment. When observed, each wing is different in its own right. In our case, we were a very sheltered wing. Even though all of us had many friends outside the wing, we mostly hung out in the wing itself. It sort of became a home away from home, a place to always come back to. This homely vibe was also why we never caught on with the idea of spending time in the Academic area as many do. If we had gaps between 2 classes, we went back to the wing instead of going to the Library or Lounge.",
      "This wing culture was severely affected by COVID. I have noticed it a lot in the subsequent batches, especially Y20s. Gone were the shared living spaces that were replaced by WhatsApp groups and Discord servers. You could care less about someone being your wingie since the college experience was entirely online. This helped people in some ways as interaction outside the wing became much easier but also hindered the special status given to a wing. When people finally came to college, they were split up and thrown into random rooms irrespective of wing or hall. Many of these people had no place to fall back upon, a place to call home. No matter how cursed, the Y19s were lucky indeed as the bonds of a wing were never lost, even after COVID.",
      "I feel blessed regarding the people I met on campus and for most of them I still wonder, ‚ÄúWhat even makes us friends?‚Äù. Once me and my wingies, Aryan and Mantaas, discussed this question at length on how and at what point, you may call someone a friend. ‚ÄúDo you have to share the same interests?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you think alike?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo you have the same belief system?‚Äù and for me, the answer to most of them was no.",
      "You may have friends who share the same interests such as in a club or friends you make due to circumstances, like your department friends. Some friendships may happen over time, like in the case of a wing. The bonds get deeper as you spend more time with them. However, there are cases where you cannot put into words why you are friends with someone as you connect with them at a more human level. You may not agree on many things but you know, this is a person you can trust. Maybe if circumstances were different, I would never have been friends with many such people, and that I dread.",
      "I don‚Äôt think I would be able to mention all the people who were close to me, so I would like to name-drop everyone. First would be my wingies, I would not have survived this college without their help. Here‚Äôs to you Sumit, Aryan, Saad, Panshul, Saurabh, Aman, Ayush, Varun, Bhaumik, Ankit, Shivam, Raghav, Arpit, Mantaas, Rahul, Rajnish, and yes, even you Rupeshwar, wherever you are. A special thanks to Rajnish for bearing with my antics for this past year. Next would be other Y19s such as the folks from C3 Pranjal, Jaskirat, and Sanskar, the other leaders from GameDev, Abhay, Jeet, and Yash, folks from the CHM department, Anil and Ghulam, and even the Y20 juniors from GameDev, Ishan, Naman, Prakhar, Rudransh and many more.",
      "However, what if you don‚Äôt get along with your friends or you have a falling out with them? This doesn‚Äôt mean all is lost. You must try to fix things with them and make them understand your side. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you must remember that you are not alone, there are always people out there who would care for you. Surround yourself with such people, people who won‚Äôt judge you. There are always communities you can be a part of such as a club, sports team, department study group, or just a random group who you sit with at the mess or canteen. It doesn‚Äôt take much to become fast friends with someone. What I want to say is, that no matter what, you will find someone. And even if it doesn‚Äôt work out with them, you will find someone else. Always keep looking, everybody needs somebody.",
      "‚ÄúTired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rainAnd you are young and life is long, and there is time to kill todayAnd then one day you find ten years have got behind youNo one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun‚Äù",
      "I guess I have preached a lot in this AWL but that doesn‚Äôt mean my life is all fine and dandy. Everyone has their own evils, things that they know are wrong but still haven‚Äôt fully worked out. If I look at myself, one of my biggest evils would be procrastination. This AWL is another case of me procrastinating a lot to finally write. It has been the source of many hardships, in my academics, in my career, and in my life. This resulted in many lost opportunities and with each, you get a new what-if scenario in your mind, ‚ÄúWhat if this thing turned out differently?‚Äù.",
      "The root cause in most of these cases was either laziness or carelessness. You didn‚Äôt study for an exam and now it has come to bite you back. Sometimes though, you were waiting for the perfect opportunity. You feared you would ruin things but till then, it was too late. Now I know, you will never be perfect enough in your mind, the ceiling keeps getting higher. You can work a lot on perfecting that portfolio but after some time, you have to send it to recruiters. You have to shoot your shot or else you will regret it.",
      "There are many such things that I have regrets about, in fact, too many to count. This emotion though, ‚ÄúRegret‚Äù, has been a part of my life for as long as I remember. Regrets about the past, things I could change, things I feel sad about. They cling to you and it‚Äôs hard to let them go. And the questions keep coming back,¬† ‚ÄúWhat if I did something different‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaybe I shouldn‚Äôt have said that thing‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMaybe I was at fault and should have apologized‚Äù. They haunt me day in and day out as many of these have been the results of my own actions. For those, only I‚Äôm to blame but some things were out of my control. Things that would have been the same no matter what I did, but still, I am not able to let those regrets go.",
      "There are too many incidents to count but I won‚Äôt be mentioning them here. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not comfortable talking about them. I overthink these incidents a lot and sometimes, it‚Äôs not a complete waste of time. It may help you in analyzing your actions and you can learn to be a better person. But after some time, you have to accept it and let it go. What‚Äôs gone is gone forever, it won‚Äôt come back. The only thing you can do is look forward to the future.",
      "‚ÄúI talk to the windMy words are all carried awayI talk to the windThe wind does not hearThe wind cannot hear‚Äù",
      "Let‚Äôs go back to the purpose of this AWL which I mentioned earlier. Can reading about someone else‚Äôs life experiences make your own life better? This is one thing that I aim to achieve here. If reading this AWL helps someone and makes their lives better or if any person gains more clarity about themselves by reading about mine, then this will have been worth it.",
      "I don‚Äôt claim any expertise in mental health but I think at one or multiple points in my 4th year, I was depressed. Now I don‚Äôt want to use the word depression as a buzzword to anyone going through it as I don‚Äôt know how to quantify the severity of my case. There was a tragic incident a few months back concerning one of our batchmates and I don‚Äôt mean any disrespect to anyone‚Äôs struggles in life. I am trying to come at this through my understanding of my own life. I might be wrong and if you disagree with it, you can disregard my opinions as the ravings of a foolish person.",
      "So where were we? Yes, how to make one‚Äôs life better? For now, I have reached only one answer to this ‚ÄúOnly you know how to fix your life, no one else does‚Äù. Only you know what‚Äôs wrong and only you can save yourself. What others can do is become your support system. This is what I want the readers to make sure, have a solid support system. Your friends, your wingies, or your partner, all of them are your support group. Never hesitate to ask them anything, they won‚Äôt judge you. If they do, they were never your friends to begin with. Also, you will always have your family at your side.",
      "When I look at my case, the only thing I can say for sure was that life was pretty shit back then and I didn‚Äôt have a solution for it. My academics were going downhill, I didn‚Äôt have a job and there was a chance my degree may be extended. Things were so bad sometimes, that I didn‚Äôt even know if I could tell anyone about it, about what was going on. I was scared about what they would think of me. But that was where I was wrong. Sure life was shit, but feeling shitty about yourself won‚Äôt make it any better. Did it feel good to do nothing, eat nothing, sleep all day, or talk to no one? No, but it did feel better than interacting with other people. I was not able to live normally, acting like things were completely fine with me.",
      "When faced with hardships, I chose the easy way out and that was to quit. I quit studying, quit going to classes, quit spending time with wingies, and quit my internship, but that didn‚Äôt fix anything. That just made things worse and let me tell you, there is no limit to how bad things can get. Things may hit rock bottom and you think, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way this could get any worse‚Äù, and somehow, it does get worse. The only way to fix it is by working on it and the first step is acknowledging it. The first thing you should do is tell yourself that there is a problem. It may or may not have been caused by you but you have to accept that there is a problem, something that is affecting your life right now and you have to solve it.",
      "‚ÄúAnd anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,Don‚Äôt carry the world upon your shoulders.For well you know that it‚Äôs a fool who plays it coolBy making his world a little colder.‚Äù",
      "Once you have accepted that there is a problem, you can start by finding solutions for it and the best place to start is with your mental health. A sound mind is an efficient mind and it can help you in fixing the other parts of your problem. The best solution for my mental health and maybe for yours, is talking about the problem. This is something you have to do, you talk about it. No matter how hard it is, you say what the problem is, you tell yourself and others how you truly feel about it and if you want, you ask them for help. If someone considers you an important part of their lives, they will do anything in their power to help you. What‚Äôs the point of having a friend if you can‚Äôt even rant to them?",
      "During the entire 4th year, I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I hid the truth of how my life and academics were going, to my friends and family. This didn‚Äôt help as things just got worse over time and at some point, hiding the truth hurt more than speaking about it. I am grateful for how everyone reacted to it, especially my wingies, Arpit and Aman who were understanding of my situation. Opening up to them and my family was harder than expected but it was the right step forward. I did not expect the level of support I received, but I guess that‚Äôs why they are your family.",
      "I am not saying that doing some therapy with your friends and family is going to fix your life. It won‚Äôt, things can always get bad and at the worst possible time. One month later, when I thought that my life was finally back on track, it got worse than ever before. So then what? You think I might have learned my lessons and sought support from others but you would be wrong. I again hid the truth and went back to the old isolationist habits. The only positive here was I was able to pull myself back before I did anything reckless. I gathered up the courage and told my family what the truth was. This doesn‚Äôt mean the problem was fixed. My degree got extended and I had to finish it by next year.",
      "Sometimes, things just don‚Äôt work out. Life is not your generic AWL where against all odds, the person gets placed right at the end, barely passes all the hard courses and the wing successfully goes on that Goa trip. In the real world, people fail and statistically most of us will fail, at some point or another. But no matter how hard it gets, you can always make it better. Comparing myself to the version of me from one year ago, I can say I am 10 times happier now.",
      "So, did I win at life? No. Did I get that dream GameDev job? Maybe, time will tell. Is it a high-paying job like my peers? No, but I won‚Äôt let it ruin my day. Now I know that no matter what, there are things in life to be glad about. Your friends, your family, these are the people who are there for you. Even if you‚Äôre not happy with your life, they will be happy with you, however you are.",
      "‚ÄúA voice from the past,Joining yours and mineAdding up the layers of harmonyAnd so it goes, on and onMelodies of life,To the sky beyond the flying birdsforever and beyond‚Äù",
      "Here we are, the end. For all the ‚Äúgyaan‚Äù I tried to pass on in this AWL, I still feel dissatisfied. With myself. No matter what I say, I don‚Äôt always follow what I preach. I mentioned that you should not let regrets control you but here I am, still burdened by new regrets. Even though I talked so much about opening up to others, I still involve others as a last resort when it comes to my own struggles. Believing in something and actually living it are two vastly different things.",
      "I burdened myself with questions, ‚ÄúWho am I to tell you all how to live?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat if no one reads this?‚Äù. This made me not want to write this AWL. It took time before I realized something, and it also pushed me to write after all. I am sorry if this comes out a little selfish, but I was not only writing it for others. I was also writing it for myself. To remind me, on how to live, how to let go of the past, and how to change myself for the better. I still have a lot to learn and who knows how my story will turn out.",
      "So, what can you do? If you liked anything from what I have mentioned, you can start by trying to implement it into your IITK journey. Go out there and find yourself, only you know who you are. Once you know, work on it. There may be hurdles in your way. You may succeed or fail, but no matter what, never let go of the people who are close to you. You‚Äôre not alone in your journey. I‚Äôll also try to stick to the path I have chosen for myself. All in all, don‚Äôt stop believin‚Äô.",

      "In the 38th edition of As We Leave, Adit Thampi, a Y20 graduating student in the Department of Material Science and Engineering, shares his journey of finding long-lasting friendships, his experience with research internships abroad and its role in cementing his love for research.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Before high school, I was not aware of what I was preparing for; I thought it was just an extension of school. I will take my board exams, and it‚Äôs all done. Little did I know that I had to make one of the most significant decisions of my life. This was big because I had to choose not only my college but also my discipline of study for the next four years!",
      "During school, the excitement and interest in experimenting with different chemicals was the turning point of my life. This helped me decide that I wanted to continue in the field that possessed Chemistry and was hands-on, which led me to the field of Materials Science. On further research, I shortlisted the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK), India, as my first preference for undergraduate. I also chose this discipline with a broader goal of pursuing a PhD in the same field. My journey at IITK helped me strengthen my interest in Materials Science and paved the way for my desire to pursue a career in scientific research. But honestly, I did not know anything about materials science; all I knew was that it has immense potential for higher studies. So, I took the leap of faith and joined IITK.",
      "As our batch started during the pandemic, we had online classes, which prevented me from getting a chance to socialise that much. After 1.5 years of online courses, we finally got the opportunity to come on campus. So I packed my bag (pretty much only clothes and a lot of excitement) and headed towards Kanpur. I had spent my entire childhood in South India, and when I reached Kanpur in December, I found it freezing cold. So cold that I instantly felt like going back home.",
      "Furthermore, I am an introvert, so I could not really start a conversation with someone new; this just aggravated my feeling of being homesick. The troubles did not end there; soon, I got infected with COVID-19, due to which I was under quarantine for a few days. As soon as I came out, we were informed that the classes were being changed to hybrid mode, following which I ran back home the same week.",
      "After a few months, when the situation got better, we were all again called back on campus. This time, when I went back, I got an amazing roommate and one of my closest friends, Devesh Sootail. Soon after, I met three other wingies of mine; little did I know that we would become very good friends; they are Siddharth, Sabir, and Shubham. Eventually, I got along with every wingy of mine in F6, hall 12. This made me feel like these four years may not be that bad after all.",
      "I have always been passionate about basketball since my school days. So, after a few weeks of reaching campus, I started to train during the evening at the basketball court on the main PE ground, along with seniors and other team players. This brought me an opportunity to participate in Udghosh 2021. This was my first professional basketball tournament, and I was very excited about it.Even though we lost at the end, we left the court with lots of memories and new friends. I continued to pursue basketball and participated in Udhgosh 2022 and 2023. Udhgosh 2022 was very special to me because that was the first time I got a jersey with my name and number on the back. I went on to represent IITK in Inter IIT 2022 in IIT Delhi as well. Inter IIT was an experience I will always cherish forever; we roamed together wearing IITK jackets around IITD in front of all the other IITs, we played motivational music right from the hall till the court to warn everyone of our presence, and last but not the least we used to meet every day to discuss our gameplan. All in all, I felt like I found a family; juniors were always ready to help, and my fellow batch mates were always by my side; seniors were super supportive and caring. I still remember that a month before Inter IIT, I could not train every day because I had to take exams for my higher studies application, and my seniors relaxed the training for me. I am really fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet such amazing and extremely talented seniors on and off the court.",

      "Picture 5 is after our friendly match against IIM Lucknow.",
      "Special mention goes to my seniors Yash, Harshit, Pushpit, Saikat, and Fahad, who have been extremely supportive and cooperative.",
      "Basketball would not have been fun without my fellow batchmates Melvin and Juniors, of course.",
      "Offline classes gave me the opportunity to interact with people in my department. So now I started interacting with a lot more people on a daily basis. I made really good friendships with a lot of people that I know will last forever. We attended college fests together, hung out regularly, and, most importantly, they helped me grow as an individual. They made attending class not so boring.",
      "Special mention goes to Ojsi, Khoobhayshee, Naman, Akshaj, Shreeya, Riyan, Payal, and Sweta for always being there for me. These people truly brought life to MSE and my IITK journey.",
      "Forever grateful to Prakhar, Aman and Ajit, who always happened to be my labmates. We literally enjoyed every lab, laughing our way through.",
      "Last but not least, Ganesh, Shubham, Mohan, Dwij, Yash and Yashwardhan supported me and were my companions in and outside the lecture hall.",
      "Being part of such a premier institute is a matter of privilege, mainly because of its recognition, and you get innumerable academic opportunities. I got the opportunity to actively conduct research both in IITK and abroad for almost 2.5 years of college. IITK fueled my path toward becoming a researcher and pursuing a PhD by helping me receive the DAAD Wise scholarship‚Äô23 to conduct research at the University of Cologne, Germany. This was one of those opportunities that I will forever cherish. This was my first time travelling abroad alone. This internship forced me to learn cooking and manage my finances, two skills one must know eventually. Above all, I learned to maintain a work-life balance. I used to work during the week and travel through the weekend. I got to explore the culture, beauty and food of six different countries during my project. I am also truly indebted to IITK for nominating me as one of the five students for the Sakura Science Exchange Program‚Äô23 in Tokyo, Japan. This program allowed me to try Japanese food, experience Japanese culture and attend conferences and academic seminars. Above all, this trip helped me make four friends; we travelled to Japan together, navigated the unknown roads as if we were on holiday and finally shouted and enjoyed in the silent and busy metros of Japan. I would have never imagined that joining IITK would bring me these opportunities.",

      "Pictures 3 and 4 show some places I visited during my internship in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, respectively.",
      "Pictures 5, 6 and 7 show the city of Cologne (where I was doing my internship).",
      "Just like that, my 3 years of college life went by very fast. I had to shift to A3 in Hall 9, where my wingies were mostly the same as earlier, but this time, all of us were very close and often spent a lot of time together, either playing cricket, football, basketball, cards or mafia. Above all, we used to try to eat dinner together every day. I still remember a whole table occupied by our wing, and we used to see cricket on the phone resting against a water jug. The seventh semester of last year was one of the most stressful ones as everyone either focused on placements or research opportunities to start off their professional career. So, I got extremely busy completing all the requirements for my application for a PhD.",
      "As we come to the end of this AWL, just as my journey at IITK with my final semester. I would say it was the most happening semester as the placement phase 1 had just gotten over, and I was seeing most of my friends getting placed just then. I was wondering if I had made the right decision to pursue research as a career because I had either not heard from a university or I was getting rejections from a few universities. I have to admit my wingies played a huge part in motivating me every day and making me laugh during these tough times. On January 22, 2024, I got a PhD admit from Stanford at around 3 am. This did not just bring happiness and tears to my eyes, but my whole wing started shouting or hugging me. I am forever grateful to have found friends, more like brothers, with whom I could share the same corridor!",
      "Special mention to Tony, my furry friend in hall 9.",
      "Following this, I went on a trip with my friends; those days were the best days of my life. We had to hop on trains without tickets and went on a jungle safari, river rafting, trekking and a million memories that will stay forever. A trip that took our friendship to another level. I still remember us jumping on the beds, roaming the streets of Rishikesh late in the night, jumping in the swimming pool and trekking early in the morning without having any food.",
      "Special mention to Manvendra (to my right in the first photo) and Pranshu (to my left in the first photo). Manvendra and I went on to become really good friends, and Pranshu was my wingie from my second year, so we used to have fun every other day.",
      "The highlight of my IITK journey was meeting Sumit, Vishal, Ritvik, Hemant, Yatendra, Sunil and Praveen. The meeting might have been an accident, but the journey from there on was meant to be. So it goes as follows: one day, I had to go to Eshop with Devesh (my earlier roommate, as mentioned before), but since Sumit‚Äôs room was near the exit of Hall 9, Devesh dragged me to his room, where I met Sumit and Vishal. When I met them, I felt like I already knew them; our vibes instantly matched. Soon after, I met Hemant, who happened to stay in the same block. From that day, I used to spend most of my time with them, playing cards all night or roaming campus late at night. Just a few days later, these people introduced me to Ritvik, Yatendra, Praveen, and Sunil while I was playing cricket. And this is how our little group was completed (the group already existed but became complete with my joining xD). We danced through the pronights of Techkriti, pulled all-nighters roaming the campus, played cards together (where Sunil used to be the DJ, playing songs we vibed through until morning), cycled to Rave Moti to watch movies, and most importantly, we used to drink tea together at least once a day. We had a place to drink tea at Kalyanpur (Balaji tea stall). I used to rarely drink tea, but whenever we went there, I never refused to have at least one cup. I must say, these people taught me how to live a life; they truly justify the lingo ‚ÄúChill Hai‚Äù.",
      "Special mention goes to Rakesh and Aman, who are some of the kindest people I have ever met.",
      "Picture 2 is a gift with all our most memorable photos gifted to me by Vishal, Devesh, and Sumit for me to keep as a memory and cherish forever.",
      "I learnt that it‚Äôs not the quantity of friends you know; rather, it‚Äôs the quality of friends you have. Finally, they taught me the art of not sleeping all night yet making it to classes on time the next day as though I had slept well. I might have met them only a year back, but they stayed with me through thick and thin. We enjoyed ourselves, helped each other, worked together, and shared every emotion we were going through. I came to IITK in search of friends. Now, I am living with a family, friends like brothers, who I know, even if I call them late in the night, will be up and ready to help. I really don‚Äôt know with whom I will drink chai from now.¬† Thank you, Chai Vasi people, for accepting me as your friend, being there for me always and making my last year very, very memorable.",
      "This photo is us drinking tea (our go-to drink) at 5 am after cycling to the tea stall at Kalyanpur.",
      "Before wrapping up, I must admit that all my friends have helped improve my Hindi; coming from South India where I used to rarely use Hindi for any communication, now I can converse and understand Hindi gaalis too.",
      "This photo was taken after our convocation and before I got into the taxi to leave campus, it was the toughest goodbye for me.",
      "Therefore, IIT Kanpur gives you wonderful avenues for well-rounded growth. My research experiences were all due to the opportunities provided by IITK. One of my biggest pieces of advice will be to constantly check your mail and stay updated. To conclude, one of the most valuable things that I will miss when I leave IIT Kanpur is the friendships that I have made over the years, which have translated from friends to family. This is one of the hardest goodbyes I have ever faced.",
      "All in all, if I have to leave a message to the coming generations of IIT Kanpur, it will be as follows:",
      "Follow your passion, no matter what the world thinks about your decisions; if, at the end of the day, you are satisfied with the path you have chosen, then you will go a long way. Also, do not get influenced by others around you; some things that work for them might not work for you, so believe in yourself and follow your heart. I personally believe thata good blend of passion and dedication with tonnes of hard work is the mantra for success.",

      "In this 37th edition of As We Leave, Anshika Singh, a Y20 student graduating in the Department of Material Science and Engineering, shares her inspiring journey. She reflects on the challenges she faced during online semester and how her life took a magical turn thereafter. She reminisces about her cherished college moments, friendships and her experiences at Prayas, which provided her the with the best memories of her entire college life.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "After so much contemplation, I‚Äôve finally decided to share this. Let‚Äôs start by introducing myself. This is Anshika Singh, a girl who comes from a very small village in Uttar Pradesh where modern facilities are scarce and very few have seen higher education or significant success. Our village struggles with frequent power outages and limited internet access.",
      "Like every other student, I was very excited to join college, though my excitement was tinged with apprehension. Before joining IIT Kanpur, someone told me that my branch, ‚ÄúMaterials Science and Engineering,‚Äù had little scope in India, which was very disheartening for me. So, I joined IIT with the goal of working very hard, getting decent CPI, and switching to a so-called better branch.",
      "Due to Covid, classes were held online. From the first lecture on the Hello IITK platform, I knew I had to work extra hard. My limited internet access made attending classes and exams very difficult. While others enjoyed Bulla sessions, family meets, and department meetings, I battled to download lectures, open quizzes, and submit assignments.",
      "To solve this issue, I discovered a spot near a pond about a kilometer away from my home, where internet access was slightly better. Every day, I walked there to download lectures then returned home to watch them. This routine was exhausting, but somehow I was managing. During exams, things used to get more difficult. Without a proper place to sit and with inconsistent internet, I often couldn‚Äôt submit my answers on time.",
      "I vividly remember the PHY103 mid-semester exam, held on the Codetantra platform. Despite having a charged laptop, my battery ran low during the exam. I ran home for a charging point, plugged it in, and continued the test, but there was no internet access at home. Still, I tried to submit my answers, but it took around 20 mins for a single answer to upload, and then the submission failed.",
      "Then came the MTH101 exam. It was my first day of contracting Covid, and my body was weak. The fever and body aches were intense, but I had an exam scheduled. Under the scorching sun, I sat in the open, struggling to focus on the questions. My internet connection was poor, and it failed despite submitting my answers 5 minutes before the submission time. I took screenshots and emailed them, but my efforts went unrecognized, and my grades suffered.",
      "The rainy season brought its own set of challenges. During one exam, it started pouring heavily. I had no shelter, and my waterproof bag could somehow protect my laptop. My exam papers were completely soaked, and I could not write anything. My phone screen became wet, and it stopped working. I couldn‚Äôt submit my answers and had to run for cover.",
      "These and many such incidents left me devastated, and my grades suffered despite my hard work. At times, I felt hopeless and considered giving up.",
      "As I faced these challenges, I knew I had to find better ways to adapt if I wanted to succeed. I started waking up earlier and staying up later to find moments when the internet connection might be more stable. I contacted professors and explained my situation, hoping for some leniency or alternative submission methods, but their hands were often tied by rules.",
      "Despite multiple adversities, I always tried to find ways to adapt. I began seeking help from family friends, and acquaintances in town who had better internet facilities. On exam days, I would travel to their homes and give exams. But this wasn‚Äôt a perfect solution, as it was awkward to impose on them, but it was necessary for my education. These adjustments, though small, started to make a difference.",
      "Initially, my biggest insecurity was my lack of proficiency in English. Because of this, I would avoid speaking with people who were fluent in English, fearing that I would embarrass myself in front of them due to my poor language skills. So, I used to talk only to those who mostly spoke Hindi. I met many good people here. It was the first time in my life that I met such broadminded people, who later became my very good friends. It is very big thanks to these supportive friends that I began confronting this insecurity. They encouraged me to start interacting with everyone, significantly boosting my confidence.",
      "Realizing that I needed to diversify my college experience beyond academics, I sought other avenues to excel. I joined several clubs and took up various roles to broaden my horizons and gain new skills. These activities allowed me to meet new people, make friends, and learn from my seniors. I became the Secretary of the Design and Animation Club and the Secretary of the Photography Club. I joined the Student Placement Office as a company coordinator and became a student guide at the Counseling Service. Involvement in these clubs helped me a lot to strengthen my leadership and interpersonal skills. It has helped me interact with many seniors and connect strongly with them. These Seniors have always guided me and helped me to navigate all the challenges.",
      "I also joined Prayas as a Volunteer. Prayas is a society that aims to help underprivileged students near the campus by providing them with free educational facilities.During Covid, Prayas classes were running Online. I vividly remember my first class with Prayas. It was a science class for third and fourth grades. It was raining that day. I stood under an umbrella at my network spot and conducted the class. The eagerness and enthusiasm of the children were contagious. The students of Prayas were a constant source of inspiration. They faced numerous challenges yet never gave up on their education. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by my struggles, I thought about these children and their unyielding determination. It gave me the strength to keep going.",
      "Although there were many challenges but, with the support of my seniors and batchmates, college life has been incredibly rewarding. Their motivation and encouragement have always helped me stay positive and made my life much more beautiful. I started enjoying things. In Fact, I started enjoying the challenges I was facing. Instead of feeling demotivated, each challenge strengthens my determination and boosts my confidence to tackle it.",
      "In October 2021, students with resource constraints were called back to campus. I was selected after submitting numerous proofs of my struggles. Seeing IIT Kanpur for the first time in person was surreal.",
      "I still remember the day I was completing the paperwork at the Community Centre. A masked person was helping me with my luggage, and I assumed he was an official assigned by the institute to assist students. Later, I met Nishant, a senior and a very good friend of mine, and discovered it was actually him helping me. That moment was incredibly awkward yet memorable, marking the beginning of a wonderful journey.",
      "After coming to campus. Life changed dramatically; I finally had access to resources and facilities I had only dreamed of. Finally, I had a good internet connection, no electricity issues with such a big and beautiful college campus, a proper study environment, and access to all the academic resources, etc.",
      "Most of my friends were not resource-constrained, so they were at home. Initially, as an introvert, making friends was very challenging for me, and I had difficulty adjusting to the new environment. However, things changed when I met Khushi. I started hanging out with her. She is such a cheerful, happy, and fun-loving person who literally brought ‚ÄúKhushiya‚Äù into my life. Through her only, I met her friends Navneet, Swayam, Sahil, Akshay, Pratibha, and Mohan, and we all became best friends.",
      "Campus life felt like a dream. Every morning brought new experiences and adventures. We were always together, exploring and enjoying life. Night outs, cycling around campus, discovering new places, watching movies, dancing and singing loudly in front of L20 at night, sleeping on the floors in front of lecture halls, and doing random crazy things‚Äîthese fun activities defined our days. This was the first time I experienced such freedom.",
      "With all the fun activities, I also focused intensely on my academics, and my grades began to improve. The experience of being on campus, with all its facilities and opportunities, was transformative.",
      "Though I initially joined many clubs, I decided to concentrate solely on Prayas. Experiencing Prayas in its offline form was heartwarming. The dedication and selflessness of the volunteers and the joy and respect from the kids were unparalleled. Every day, as we entered Prayas, students would greet us with ‚ÄúNamaste Didi‚Äù with such beautiful smiles, respect, and love on their faces. This warm welcome always touched my heart, inspiring me to do more and more for them.",
      "At Prayas, I took on the role of Manager. Throughout my tenure, we ensured that classes for the students ran smoothly and without any hindrances. We organized various educational and extracurricular sessions, such as Fine Arts classes, Sexual Awareness sessions, and Skating workshops. Celebrating festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Raksha Bandhan with the kids brought immense joy and a sense of community.",
      "I vividly remember the Diwali festival when we visited the students‚Äô homes to distribute sweets and celebrate with them. Celebrating with these kids and their parents made my day the most wonderful, filled with warmth and happiness, making me feel as if I were celebrating with my own family.",
      "Visiting the homes of Prayas students to understand their family situations and manage their admission processes was a deeply fulfilling part. It gave me a deeper understanding of their challenges and always motivated me. The respect their parents give and how they welcome us is heartwarming. Every day after class, students eagerly asked, ‚ÄúDidi, Aaj mere ghar chaliye ..Mai aapke liye ‚Ä¶(some dish) banaunga/banaungi.‚Äù And they also used to fight among themselves by saying ‚ÄúDidi aaj mere ghar jayegi‚Äù. These moments brought me immense joy and a sense of purpose.",
      "I coordinated with various people to arrange donations for cycles, books, and stationery, which were critical to the students‚Äô needs. These donations significantly impacted their lives, enabling them to come to Prayas regularly and study effectively.",
      "One of the most memorable experiences was organizing the Annual Day event. It required meticulous planning and coordination. Students prepared various dances, dramas, songs, etc. The entire preparation period was such a good time when I got closer to these kids. On the day of the event, seeing the parents‚Äô faces light up with pride and joy as they watched their children‚Äôs talents on display was completely priceless.",
      "No matter how many years pass, Prayas will always hold a special place in my heart. The small excuses the kids made, their naughtiness, and their cute, innocent explanations and questions are unforgettable. The work at Prayas was immensely fulfilling, giving me a sense of purpose and a deeper appreciation for the value of education. The children and their families became an extended part of my life, and their progress and happiness are my greatest rewards.",
      "My grades were finally improving. I also secured an internship through the Student Placement Office at Vedanta Resources. This opportunity provided me with real-world experience, allowing me to see how the concepts we learned in the lab are applied at the industry level. The experience was transformative. It gave me a real-world perspective on my field and allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had gained..",
      "I also received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from Vedanta. Given the challenging job market conditions, I accepted the offer.",
      "Reflecting on my journey, the people I met at IIT Kanpur have been the best part. From struggling in my village to thriving on campus, the support and experiences I‚Äôve gained are invaluable. I will cherish these memories forever. The support from my family, friends, professors, and the Prayas community has been instrumental in my journey.",
      "The friendships I made on campus are priceless. I found a group of supportive friends who shared my values and aspirations. We studied together, participated in activities, and supported each other through tough times. These relationships have enriched my life and provided a strong support system.",
      "The experiences at IIT Kanpur have been diverse and enriching. The lessons learned, skills acquired, and memories made will stay with me forever.",
      "My advice to juniors is to stay resilient and never give up. There will be times when things seem impossible, but perseverance and determination will see you through. Embrace the challenges and use them as opportunities to grow. Focus on your academics, but also explore other areas of interest. Participate in extracurricular activities and join clubs. These experiences will enrich your college life and help you develop a well-rounded personality. Build strong relationships with your peers and professors. They will be your support system and can provide valuable guidance and advice.",
      "Stay involved in community service and give back to society. It will not only make a difference in the lives of others but also provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose.",
      "Finally, believe in yourself and your abilities. You have the potential to achieve great things. Stay focused, work hard, and trust the process. Your efforts will be rewarded, and you will achieve your goals.",
      "This is my story‚Äîa tale of struggle, resilience, and triumph. Despite the hurdles, I stayed positive and motivated, and I hope my journey inspires others to do the same.",

      "In the 36th edition of ‚ÄúAs We Leave,‚Äù Mandar Wayal, a Y20 Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering, reflects on his college life and reminisces about all the memorable experiences he had here.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As I leave, I hope IITK stays with me forever. I hope every time it rains, the clattering takes me back to the fountains in front of the library. I hope every late-night ice cream reminds me ofMama Mio. I hope I find familiar faces sipping coffee whenever I visit a CCD outlet. I hope every time I listen toChasing Cars, it reminds me of the night-outs under the bare skies at OAT. I hope the tall buildings we‚Äôd go on to live in fill me with the same serenity as the terraces in Acad Area. I hope I get to experience suchhighsagain!",
      "As I started to think about writing an AWL, I spent a lot of time thinking of the perfect way to start and end, the ideal stories to tell, and the right words to say. I didn‚Äôt write a word before I got home, only to realize that I couldn‚Äôt flawlessly sum up my life here. These past four years have been a mix of ups and downs, full of surprises, challenges, and growth. I‚Äôve learned to value every moment, even the ones that don‚Äôt seem important right now. This article will include some lessons from my journey and a lot about how these were the best 4 years of my life!",
      "Like any other student about to join an IIT, I had some expectations: glamorous fests, good placement, facilities for everything‚Äîyou know the list! But life always has its own plans for you. We spent 3 semesters at home, glued to the screens all day, downloading slides and sharingnotes. Oh, how I wish we could get back those lost years on campus! However, IITK still surpassed my anticipations with the amount of time we were offered.",
      "The trimmed online semesters allowed for little time to explore. I remember scratching my head over applying to different PORs and choosing the best SnT/ACA project. As I look at it now, these things didn‚Äôt really matter. This is not to say that the projects and involvements were useless, but the time spent worrying was. Make decisions based on your interests, and forget about the marginal gains. If you think one project or a POR will get you that placement you always dreamt of, I‚Äôve got two words and one punctuation for you: ‚ÄòWake up!‚Äô This is one of those cases where you need to trust yourgreedydecision-making since you don‚Äôt know theelementsthat lie ahead.Our seniors encouraged us toexplore.I applied to everything that interested me and ended up taking up 6 positions in my second year. One highlight was my involvement in the Counselling Service. Like half thefirst-year junta, I wanted to become a Student Guide. I applied for both SG and AM positions and was accepted. Talking to juniors about their problems (academic or otherwise) definitely changed me. I like to think it made me a better person! (at least a good listener, lol) I loved conducting lectures, solving doubts, and helping juniors. This was part of why I took up tutorship in my final year. It was also during this time that I met some of the sweetest juniors. Although I‚Äôve often criticized the Counselling Service with my CTM friends, this short tenure will have a special place in my heart!",
      "By the time we reached campus, we were already in our fourth semester. This was also the time to apply for third-year positions. I had a few options, but I was drawn to applying for the position of Leader at IITK Consulting Group (ICG). I had worked on multiple projects as a secretary and loved it.¬† I found immense satisfaction in the work, which was not only impactful but also aligned with a good cause. I skipped the CTM interviews, hoping for that spot at ICG. In the summer, I filled out the nominations, submitted the presentation, and gave the interview. The verdict? Not selected. It was the first time I went all-in about something in college and failed. I was upset and didn‚Äôt feel like preparing for the internship season. I could write another paragraph on how frustrated I was, but that‚Äôs beyond the point I‚Äôm trying to make.",
      "‚ÄúWe all have this illusion that we are in control, but not everything happens according to our will. Things will always change, and you have to deal with it. But the good news is, 4 years from now, you won‚Äôt even remember today.‚Äù",
      "Since it was already summer, most of the nominations had wrapped up. To answer my question: ‚ÄúWhat would I do in my third year?‚Äù I filled out the nominations for Manager at Outreach Cell on the last day. In hindsight, this turned out to be one of the best decisions of my college life. Conducting sessions across cities, organizing talks, and managing alum reunions was fun. Personally connecting with alums was a bonus. These involvements made me good friends and introduced me to helpful seniors. The guidance and support they offered throughout was priceless, underscoring the importance of having a good network of people to lean on.",
      "‚ÄúWhen one door closes, another opens, but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.‚Äù ‚Äì Alexander Graham Bell.",
      "We are bundled with such quotes daily, which is expected to somehow motivate us. I‚Äôve constantly bashed such thoughts because I could always find another contradictory quote that some other great person wrote. Yet, this one resonated with me. When I didn‚Äôt get a pre-placement offer from Adobe (with only a month to placement tests), I was frustrated. Since there were signs of recession, I had worked overtime during my summer internship and didn‚Äôt get time to prepare for placements. But surprise-surprise, recession also meant low (3/47) PPO rates. Parents and friends consoled, claiming that better things await. But the advice didn‚Äôt make sense then because I was going into placements with little preparation during the worst of times. Two months and countless tests later, I accepted an offer from Google. Looking back, I would have settled for the PPO if it had been offered. Similarly, my rejection from ICG had a comparable impact. I remain grateful for these lows!",
      "The final year was when everyone made the most of college. Although the placement season was rough, I didn‚Äôt forget to have fun. The last semester was something else though! People puking from balconies was a common visual. You‚Äôd always find someone blasting music out of their door. It was so easy to convince anyone to join a plan by reminding them it was the last semester. It would start with a random knock at 11 AM, and before you know it, you‚Äôd end up at Legendary/DOAA canteen/Mama Mio/OAT at 4 AM, cravingfood(mostly, hehe). I‚Äôll also cherish those fleeting moments, gasping for breath between consecutive badminton doubles. I‚Äôll miss the poker nights ending with breakfast in the morning. I won‚Äôt forget all the partying, even though it became so frequent I lost count!",
      "Along the journey, I made many close friends. IITK wouldn‚Äôt be the same without these people. Considering my inapproachable nature, I‚Äôm grateful I met such wonderful folks. And now that I‚Äôm moving on to a new chapter of my life, I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôll be without them. During my internship, I realized how you don‚Äôt just get along with everyone. We often take college connections for granted, but this is probably where you will find some of the best people. Every person I‚Äôve come across in my journey has had a story of their own. It baffles me how this set of students who aced a common exam could then go on to pursue such diverse paths. And don‚Äôt get me started on how smart everyone is! So go out and interact; just don‚Äôt sit in your room scrolling reels!",
      "The final days on campus were bittersweet. After the exams, everyone stayed back for a few days, counting down their delimited time on campus. From the revelry ofHall 1 ki Baaratto the quiet moments of reflection, each day seemed to hold a lifetime of memories. Amidst the laughter and celebrations, there were tears, too‚Äîthe kind that come when you realize you‚Äôre saying goodbye to something truly special. Bad grades? Next semesterphod denge! Break-up? Will get over it! But nobody really had an answer to things ending. As I move on, I carry with me the lessons, friendships, and memories that have shaped my journey at IITK. To the juniors: cherish each moment, seize every opportunity, and live each day on campus as if it were your last!",

Through his experiences in the Music Club, friendships, academic challenges, and personal growth, Ritick paints a vivid picture of campus life, emphasizing the importance of seizing every opportunity and making unforgettable memories",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10 in the morning. I am alone in my dorm, sitting beside my bed and thinking of all the hardest goodbyes over the past two days. All my best friends have left except one more, who is leaving today. Meanwhile, a gentle wind flows through the empty corridor, entering my room and waving my messy hair. I could hear the rustling of the leaves which reminded me of the days we spent together at the same place, screaming, laughing, fighting and enjoying ourselves together like never before. The corridor was never that quiet before and it seemed as if it was insisting me to call my friends back to slam on their doors, run around, shout and make this place lively. I went deep into my thoughts to where this journey started.‚Äù",
      "Hey there!",
      "I am Ritick, you might have seen me walking past OAT with a guitar bag and a bag pack. Some might recognise me through MClub, my obsession with Guitars, some know me through my voice, some call me a seriousness breaker and I am also known for producing noise pollution at times. Yes, it‚Äôs from the high gain stuff ofc üòâ",
      "These 4 years of my stay at IITK were majorly shaped by my friends and my interests. The beginning was overwhelming for all of us due to the well-known ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù but yes, we all survived. We heard our seniors talking about their bucket lists during their stay at campus, for us going to campus was itself the first item on our list.",
      "It was finally in December 2021, the first item on our bucket list was checked out. The joy of experiencing the campus in real life could be seen on everyone‚Äôs faces. We were already sophomores but behaved like freshers, took pictures of almost everything we saw around, roamed around, made new friends, and enjoyed our new hostel lives.",
      "I had known many people during my online semesters within the wing, my branch and the club but I didn‚Äôt have many close friends. The first person with whom I started to spend most of my time was Manas, he was the one who introduced me to most of the people whom I know now.",
      "Yes, he was also the roommate of ourresponsibleneta Sheeshram.",
      "We all spent most of the time together struggling to manage loads of things at once.",
      "Days passed, we grew up, got wise and began to settle. It was this time when we had to decide on which group we wanted to continue from now on. I was involved in various clubs/societies like IITK Motorsports, Music Club, Drams, Udghosh and whatnot. In the online mode, all of them were much easier to handle but offline we had to be physically present. In the end, I had to choose just one of them. After a lot of thought, I finally continued to Music Club as I loved playing Guitar since my childhood.",
      "The first thing which I wanted to do as soon as I reached campus was to perform on the OAT stage. Well, it was the time, the music club opened after 2 years of lockdown and we got to meet our club members in person.",
      "Everyone had the excitement to witness live performances again and were tired of doing online covers. Most of us participated in our first offline Musical Extravaganza ‚Äô22, we experienced the rigour of the run-throughs and understood that the club was much more than we anticipated. Finally, I got to feel the stage again after so many years and yes, the experience was surreal.",
      "I will never forget those Chai and Parathas after the run-throughs till 4 in the morning when everyone was exhausted and also had an 8 am class. The stage fear that kicked in when you are about to take the first note on your guitar with your friends in the audience waiting to listen to a song, they won‚Äôt even understand was just a unique experience.",
      "Events like Inter IIT, Mood Indigo and Synchronicity added to the overall flavour of the MClub because that was a time when we also had a chance to make ‚ÄúOur Music‚Äù.",
      "I remember we had around 10 days left for MoodI, most of the band members were still enjoying their holidays and our Original Composition was yet to be made. When everyone was back, we had to work 18hrs straight for a week to accomplish that. I would still remember Aarush giving us some 3 & 5 polyrhythm with a weird notation on drums which was conclusively a 4-4 with some accents. Me and Anisurya pondered on it for a long time just to transcribe it on our guitars while Akshat was sleeping on the keyboard as we didn‚Äôt have anything else to add to our song.",
      "The whole prep gave me an understanding of how difficult it is for an Artist to make a full-blown song. To be honest, our final song was actually the 5thiteration of 5 completely different songs, coz why not üòâ",
      "My stay on campus was hugely influenced by the Music Club. I got to meet amazing folks like Shivang who was always ready to fight with me and at the same time, was always there for me. I met amazing juniors like Raghav, Vedant and Rajat who had an amazing heart. I got to meet Agam and Rajit who were always ready to organize a football match, even after late run-throughs. Agam literally made an amazing poster for our last club football match.",
      "MClub was the place where I got to interact with my batchmates, seniors and juniors. It didn‚Äôt only shape me as a musician but also gave me the skill of time management. Of course, in the initial stages, I suffered a bit but later I got a hold of it. The club gave me a platform to outshow my musical abilities, interact with other musicians, expand my taste and knowledge of music.",
      "I am so grateful to everyone who was there as part of my journey at the Music Club, IIT Kanpur.",
      "My days were mostly occupied with Classes in the morning, my friends in the evening and the Music Club at night. Well, I realised a bit late that I didn‚Äôt even consider keeping track of my studies which was the first motive of coming to campus.",
      "The acquaintance of the dreadful 4thsemester of Electrical Engineering still hits me. Most of my friends were on the same page, sacrificing their acads due to their commitments. Of course, we all suffered with the grades but then we all had to make some tough decisions regarding our commitments which helped us in smoother semesters henceforth.",
      "Across the semesters, I got a chance to explore a bunch of things. One of them is Research. When I was a child, I remember the Director of my school asking me once about what I would do in future to make her proud and I answered her by saying that I wanted to discover something new. Listening to this, she giggled a bit while my friends laughed heavily. Well, I got a chance to do something similar, it‚Äôs not much of a discovery but yes, it is of course some unique addition to the present literature.",
      "As a part of my coursework, I have done various UGPs under my Professor, Dr. Twinkle Tripathy from Electrical Engineering itself. She was the one who guided me throughout my research journey, and I am blessed that I got such a nice professor who made my own Research Paper possible.",
      "Ma‚Äôam is the one who taught me to believe in my abilities and I would always admire how humble and calm she is.",
      "Well, the curious ones can access our paper here:ACC 2023, IEEE Xplore",
      "As the semesters passed, I began to know myself better and discovered new people. We were initially a group of four friends struggling with the subjects, skipping classes, making mistakes, learning and moving forward together. Later, our group expanded and I got to meet some amazing people. I must say that I have one of the most diverse groups of people who complement each other in one or the other way. Someone is totally a tubelight(no offence üôÇ )while someone is just next level. One is understanding while the other is just a free bird. Someone is always cheerful while the other one is always overthinking and millions of similar such combinations.",
      "I will always remember how unique our birthdays were, the cake was not even allowed to be touched by the birthday boy and snatched by hands. Well, those dreadful GPLs are always a must, in addition to that, one of my friends had his butt on fire with an aerosol alongside the chappals. I won‚Äôt even forget that ‚ÄúCompletely Random Guy‚Äù whom I met in my 6thsemester. These Azeeb folks almost convinced me to be the Dulhan for ‚ÄúHall 1 Ki Barat‚Äù and were even ready to wear saris. I won‚Äôt forget Wardhan for what he did to my graffiti. Those fights with Manas about his so-called ‚ÄúNoise Pollution‚Äù, my Lappu sa Sachin and Umesh who was the saviour would always be remembered.",
      "I am grateful to have these folks with me, they are the ones who complete my heart and we are the strongest together. The fact that the solution to any of your problems is just a doorstep away will be the most valuable thing which would be missed about campus.",
      "I must say that IITK is the best place I have ever been, the people, the environment, the vibe and the opportunities make this place invaluable. The most important thing which I have learnt is that there are no limits to what people here can do. People here don‚Äôt settle and always experiment with their limits. They keep growing and once in a while, you can always find someone who has just accomplished something amazing.",
      "I got to learn a lot from these people and would suggest that if you ever find someone like that, go forward and interact with him/her. You would always be enlightened with something new from which you can learn and grow.",
      "It‚Äôs always better not to sit all day inside your room or be in the library the whole day. Roam around, and explore various clubs, games and teams because it‚Äôs the people who would help you grow faster as there might be someone or the other who would have excelled in the same thing you are doing right now. Learn from them, ask them and pass on the same to your juniors.",
      "There‚Äôs a lot more to write about the plethora of experiences we all have had but still I would like to conclude my not-so-interesting AWL by saying that,",
      "‚ÄúThink wisely and be decisive about each step you take because in the end,it‚Äôs you who can make these four years count.‚Äù",
      "Thank you",

      "In the 34th th edition of As We Leave, Yash Gupta, a B.Tech student in Mechanical Engineering, candidly shares his journey through IITK. Yash‚Äôs reflections capture the essence of campus life, perseverance, and the bonds that make it all worthwhile.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hi all, even before joining the campus, I had planned to explore a lot and make the most out of it. I have never been a decent storyteller, so this AWL is as raw as I have lived it. This AWL is the same as what I have done all four years, submitting at the last minute.I am a person who enjoys the moment and doesn‚Äôt remember most of it later. I may not smile at success, but I do a lot of RR on failure or a little less success. So, this AWL might be a bit odd. Kindly bear with it.In the first year, I planned to join clubs like KOS and DNA as I thought this would help me show off the learning to my relatives (which, to a certain extent, they do). But soon, I understood that I could not do so tiring practice for dance, nor did I get interested in design too much.Throughout the eight semesters, I didn‚Äôt do any kind of ‚Äònashe‚Äô and had a great time at IITK. One might think smoking and drinking make you seem cool, but ignore seniors and cinema-induced thoughts. It deteriorates your health, both physically and mentally. I was fortunate to have a wing with the same ideology, which helped me cope with the rigorous studies and other general stuff of IITK.",
      ".",
      "IITK gives you wingssss‚Ä¶(Fahad, Yasvir, Prabuddha, Gitte, Narendra, Me, Prince, Hariom, Pandey)",
      "The online sem went well because I managed to do a lot of jugaad. When it comes to jugaad, there might only be a few who might beat me, xD. Though all you have to do is message as many as you can, find the resources and show the art of Googling. Later, the increase in mech courses decreased my interest in studies. Thanks to study sessions with Shukla and Sunil and help from Paramveer, I somehow went on with the courses.",
      "I have a massive interest in detective movies, so I chose to join the Election Commission in the first year. EC was the place where I met people from Y17-Y21. Saw how people used to take pride in deceiving EC for their ‚Äòbeloved‚Äô seniors and friends, ignoring how it would affect the campus community. I believe EC always conducted the elections fairly and unbiased (at least what I have seen and done). I left EC in the third year due to a possible collision of interests in EC and Fest. I had also contested for hall presi but fortunately lost, as I later learned how toxic the hall politics are. I also filled in the form for CTM, which I desperately wanted to be, but got rejected in the first round thanks to their ‚Äòcriteria‚Äô (and nepotism :)). You might find nepotism in various societies of IITK.",
      "The RC time (return of the Resource Constraint students) was one of the best stay times at IITK. All the academia being online, a lot of free time with friends, the khaali-khaali sa campus, what else would you need!! I remember my birthday GPL with numerous chappals and cold water in the month of November! That was also the time when we first got interested in CP (competitive programming) and gave contests. We used to finish our dinner between 7.30 and 7.50 to get ready at tables for the contest to start. I, along with Mayank, Fahad and Narendra, used to compete with each other. This habit developed a strong foundation of competitiveness and speed solving, and strengthened bonding between the wingmates.",
      "RC wing ka samuhik snaan",
      "The learning at DNA got me to the post of Head of Design at Udghosh ‚Äô22. The position allowed me to meet some of the very hard-working people who had invested their day and night into the conduction of the fest. I learned a lot from all the team members, including my co-head and wingie Fahad. I used to wonder how a bunch of college students at the mere age of 19-20 managed to conduct a huge fest; there, I got to know how.",
      "However, the tenure of the head was colliding with the 1st intern phase, and I couldn‚Äôt give much effort to the intern perp, resulting in me facing hardships in getting an internship. I also tried a little to apply off-campus but it is a much more tedious and difficult task to get an internship compared to on-campus.",
      "The end result of sleepless nights",
      "One great benefit from reading all the mails was volunteering in the ‚ÄúIndia Water Impact Summit‚Äù (IWIS) in Dec‚Äô22. We stayed in Delhi for four days, made some friends, met secretaries from various countries, and learned how the administration works at the upmost level:¬† making big claims, getting funding and then no results on the ground level. Also, met some IAS who were doing significant work in their districts.",
      "Explore- With the gov. Officials at IWIS, Interact- the PHY101 lab (one of the only two in Y20), Enjoy- First time outing after Covid: Jan‚Äô22",
      "6th sem had nothing special, and then for summers, I decided to stay on campus for placement prep. NCL was the location for me for the whole summer and 7th sem. Shukla and I used to spend the entire day and night there. He used to prepare for his UPSC, and we talked about political issues in our free time. I took two courses and performed best in my campus academia¬† (missed A* in both).",
      "I had overloaded my 3rd year and also had courses in summer, so I only had to do a total of 7 courses last year.",
      "The 7thsem went solely for placements, and the 8thsem was when I was mostly free.I had never had the patience to sit and watch web series before, thanks to Insta, so I have started watching them now.¬† Some of which I suggest (you might have seen them all) are-¬† GOT, Breaking Bad, THE BOYS, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Piece, Suits‚Ä¶ Enjoyed the last sem with a lot of movie nights with wingies, practised and performed in Dance Extravaganza, and planned to do much more, but thanks to my procrastination habit, I said what we say to the God of Death, ‚ÄúNot Today‚Äù.",
      "After the end sems, the last event for the graduating batch was ‚ÄúHall 1 ki Baarat‚Äù. I had attended it earlier in Y18, and it was one of the best moments I had spent in IITK. Gitte got nominated for Dulhan this time and asked me to be his Saheli. I took the dare and agreed to be one. Mehandi was the best event of the whole Baraat, and most of you might not know it, but it was conducted for the first time, thanks to Prem. Met a lot of great people, enjoyed the whole event, and am proud to carry the culture forward.",
      "The Ladki wale",
      "What will I miss:",
      "The infinite freedom to roam anywhere anytime, friends always available to bear your RR, take your GPL, movie night outs, gyan session by Prince, cricket and movies gyan by Yasvirl, and so many things I couldn‚Äôt even count!",
      "A few learning and bits of advice I would like to share are:",
      "Anupam ke bachche-Yasvir, Hritesh, Me, Prateek, Akshunya, Prince(Missing in the pic)",
      "Now that I have spent around 1.5 months on work, the distance between my friends seems to widen. One of my friends is only 4 km away but plans to meet, and then the actual meeting takes multiple weeks. So, you should enjoy your stay at the campus, meet everyone, and make the most of this beautiful place.Feel free to message, would love to interact.Make your parents proud. All the best!!",

      "In this 33rd edition of As We Leave, Aayush Priyadarshi, a Y19 dual degree student from the department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, takes us on a philosophical trip, reflecting on the dichotomy of rationality and irrationality, the cyclic nature of life and more.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "India lifted the cup, and five years of college came to an end. There was something cinematic about graduating on the day when two superheroes of an entire generation helped end a long drought and passed on the torch to a younger generation. There was closure, and there was a promise of change, a hope for better things to come. It felt like summer rain, a transition between seasons. Life does write the best scripts.",
      "Five years is a long time, no doubt. Strangely, the years I have spent in this place seem no more than a moment, and yet they also feel like an entire lifetime. The perception of the flow of time is a mystery. Maybe the goal of life is to not feel time. If you focus hard enough, time ceases to exist. And this world seems like a stage, in all its glory, a snapshot frozen in time. David Bowie‚Äôs magnum opus,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardustopens with a prophecy: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got five years, stuck on my eyes. Five years, what a surprise. Five years, my brain hurts a lot. Five years, that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got.‚Äù Bowie laments an impending apocalyptic disaster and introduces a world about to end in five years. Retrospectively, I find Bowie‚Äôs cataclysmic setting an interesting way to think of college life. In a sense, the end of college seems like the end of a world. The acceptance of an impending doom acts like a chain-breaker for the self. It is reminiscent of the teachings of theBhagavad Gita, where Krishna tells Arjun that the key tomokshais embracing the mortality of the body. Sometimes, you have to get close to death to get closer to life.",
      "I remember coming across Akira Kurosawa‚ÄôsRashomonin a film course I took. The film recounts an incident through the viewpoint of different characters, each with their own twisted, alternative versions of the truth. It was one of the first times I encountered the subjectivity of reality in such a raw and spellbinding manner. It‚Äôs funny how I graduated with two degrees in Maths, but the courses where I have learnt the most have been the humanities ones. I feel like the courses here have exposed my brain to two polar extremes of thinking: a contrast (and an intersection) between objective reasoning and subjective experiences. This dichotomy is a commonality to many Eastern philosophies; the Chinese called it theyin and yang, while Vedic schools used the termDvaita.",
      "I prefer to think of it in terms of numbers. The space of real numbers can be divided into two subspaces: the rationals and the irrationals. Similarly, the self can also be seen as being composed of a rational self and an irrational self. Our mind, the world, everything within and everything without, reality itself can be perceived as a spectrum with these two extremes. Life then becomes a balancing act between sanity and insanity. It is the ambition of Caesar and the asceticism of Buddha.",
      "I feel that a major problem with the modern world is that we tend to disregard the irrational, which also reflects in the negative connotations of the word. Most of us have been trained in the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù from a young age, conditioning our brains into a rational and logical way of thinking. The fact that every single thing around us, including ourselves, can be assigned a quantitative monetary value contributes to this rational belief system. A life-maximizing capital sometimes seems to be the only correct choice. But I find this outlook very discrete, very jarring. An important realization I‚Äôve had over my college life is that not only is it okay, but it is necessary to be crazy at times. In fact, the space of irrational numbers is, in a sense, much larger than the space of rational numbers. So shine on, you crazy diamond.",
      "In my mind, this campus has always been a bubble of sorts. A utopia, a fantasy land far removed from the late-stage capitalist world out there. But what is it that differentiates this environment from the outer world? One can think of it in terms of the set and the setting.",
      "The set, the people you are surrounded by here, is one of the most unique things about this campus. It is very difficult to recreate such a close-knit community of like-minded individuals. The relationship among peers here is a far cry from the ultra-Darwinian, dog-eat-dog traits of capitalism. I believe that one of the essential elements of human beings is our ability to empathize, the ability to relate to each other on a fundamental level, and the ability to recognize each other‚Äôs humanity. Pink Floyd‚Äôs Roger Waters pens it beautifully in the songEchoes, ‚ÄúStrangers passing in the street, by chance two separate glances meet. And I am you, and what I see is me.‚Äù The set of people I‚Äôve come across at IITK, and the feeling of a shared identity on campus have reinstated my belief in this empathy, in this humanity.",
      "The setting, the beautiful campus itself, provides you with a sense of comfort and peace, far away from the bustling chaos of concrete cities. This peace nurtures an environment for introspection and reflection. Some of my happiest memories of campus have been just sitting in this embrace of nature, watching the world go by. Nature provides us with some of the best metaphors. The tree of life, symbolizing a shared human consciousness. The river of time, constantly flowing and changing. The seasonal cycles of change, like death and rebirth.",
      "This blend of set and setting provides us with a liberating opportunity to feel truly free, not restricted by the chains of a rigid system. It is an environment which promotes the discovery of the self. It is a ground control for all the Major Toms out there. It is an opportunity to get in touch with your inner child, to distinguish between the alien concepts and the personal concepts, to look within and without, and to take a step closer to discovering your meaning of life.",
      "For me, this opportunity has manifested itself in the form of a re-discovery of my love for writing. I remember spending hours reading stories and writing poems as a child, lost in an imaginary world of my own. With time, however, the joy of writing was somewhat stifled by an over-competitive spirit. But throughout the past year or so, I have realized the importance of having a creative habit. Yes, writing was not going to land me a job. But writing could teach me about life. When you sit down to write, you don‚Äôt have an end goal or a conscious structure in mind. What you have are ideas. The end product is a result of the organic growth of these ideas with time, like flowers in a garden. Writing teaches you to navigate through life using ideas as your maps. Observing life through the lenses of a writer can help one make more sense of their own stories.",
      "I did not plan on writing an As We Leave initially. But being back here for convocation, I felt that this place is too beautiful not to write about. So I stayed back for a couple more days, to reflect on the learnings I have had over the last five years. That is probably why this article turned out to be more philosophical than nostalgic. One of the pages of my degree has a misprint; it reads Philosophy Minor instead of English Literature. The randomness in life is extremely beautiful sometimes.",
      "I have always felt that the world would be a better place if it were like the campus. So, I hope that whenever I look back, it makes me strive to be a better human being. And now, I am stepping out of this bubble, ready to face the real world, apprehensive of its dangers, yet with a childlike wonder for the boundless possibilities which lie ahead. I think of the first day I came here, a child leaving his home for the first time. I think of the Ouroboros, a snake devouring its own tail. I think of the cyclic nature of life. I feel like I am shedding skins, I feel like I am dying, I feel like I am being reborn. In the words of Bob Dylan,",
      "‚ÄúGood and bad I defined these termsQuite clear, no doubt, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I am younger than that now.‚Äù",

      "In the 32nd edition of As We Leave 2024, Abhimanyu Sethia, a Y19 pursuing a double major in Computer Science & Engineering and Mathematics & Scientific Computing, shares his journey, embracing the contradictions and complexities that have shaped him.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "For four years of college, I‚Äôve been on the other side of the table ‚Äì editing and following up for As We Leaves from seniors, asking them to follow a unique narrative style. And now that I am writing my own As We Leave, I find it difficult to make it unique, inherently interesting and encapsulating at the same time. There are some conventional ways to do this.",
      "One way is to remember the quintessential elements of the IITK experience ‚Äì the 7:55am breakfast to catch the 8am class; the nightouts in CC and DoAA breaks before every exam; 3am bullas with tens of wingies jampacked in your tiny room; pointlessly extended club meetings; Kathi rolls on dark OAT stairs after that; taking pride in the exam I aced after the one-nighter; blaming the prof for the messed-up exam; ranting over how these courses are irrelevant to my career; being vulnerable to your roomie at 6am who‚Äôs as clueless about life as you are; getting validation from that innocent sophomore after relaying the gyaan you heard from your cool senior in first year; cracking sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic jokes that only your friends are going to find funny, and then switching personality to go to the Feminist Theory class; planning trips that never materialise and ultimately, taking the bus to Benaras with no plans.",
      "The second clich√© is to recollect the chronology of the years: I entered this place with severe Day 1 anxiety. I remember crying in front of my dad, thinking if I had made the wrong decision. I was super-concerned about how I‚Äôd make new friends and that I‚Äôd be lonely when everyone came in with their friends from coaching classes and hometowns. I was quickly thrown out of my comfort zone when I Zumba-ed during the orientation and contested the Senate elections. My nomination was cancelled, and it felt like the end of the world. I negotiated with people and got it reinstated. Through the second year, I was back home, led on by Covid, week by week, with the slight hope that we‚Äôd return soon. I hit a mental low and lost all motivation to do anything meaningful. We returned to campus in the third year with a sense of redemption for our lost ‚Äòcollege lives.‚Äô I remember everyone coughing when the third wave hit us, and H13 was declared a containment zone. Yet we lived in denial to avoid going back home or spending a week in the Yoga hall. It made me realise how important this community was for me and each one of us. The fourth year was all about juggling crucial career decisions and a state of to-be nostalgia. The fifth-year was rather lonely without my batchmates and stressful as I dealt with a terrible placement season. The semesters were interspersed by some incredible summers ‚Äì I backpacked across the East Coast of the US without a working phone in one and lost my phone to a pickpocket in front of Jama Masjid in another.",
      "The third and fourth cliches are the ‚Äòrags-to-riches‚Äô narrative and the ‚Äòups-and-downs‚Äô rollercoaster, respectively. But, well, I come from a relatively privileged background. And, my pursuits at IITK have been met mostly with successes, interrupted by rare failures. So, I cannot pretend to have either of them.",
      "The fifth way is to look for what makes your story unique. If anything, that would be my unending pursuit to explore and figure out my interests ‚Äì I took up every stupid opportunity that came my way, be it selling T-shirts for E-Cell or taking challenging UGPs from genomics to ML. I attended every Institute talk and alumni-student interaction I could go to. I worked in two startups, an academic lab, a big tech firm, a central ministry, a news organisation and now work in an investment bank. I inverted my academic template upside down, did OEs in game theory, cognitive science and literature in 2nd year and pushed boring ESOs to the fourth year ‚Äì just because I was interested in those courses. I developed web apps in Django for a campus startup and became a Senator in my first semester ‚Äì just because I felt like doing it. I wandered but also deeply invested myself in pursuits I felt passionate about ‚Äì like how Vox can be an instrument to fight systemic community problems, and how Statistics can change the way you look at the world.",
      "Just when your AWL starts sounding too pompous, a sixth trope is to confess your sins. I smoked grass and drank a lot of alcohol. I once tried a deer‚Äôs shank after growing up in a Jain family for 18 long years. I cheated on tests and manipulated people to get what I wanted. I don‚Äôt have a moral high ground, and there‚Äôs nothing glamorous about it either. Do I have regrets? Just one, I wish I had done my Covid-year courses more honestly. I feel embarrassed to have cheated blatantly in the online exams.",
      "The necessary seventh is the paragraph for acquired wisdom ‚Äì to pass on gyaan to your unsuspecting juniors. I‚Äôll use this space to tell you that it is reductionist to weigh everything you do in college by how it will help you get that job or school, because that, merely, is not the objective of college. I did not follow the most optimal path to get a good job/grad school. Nor do I know what I want to do in life, but I‚Äôm better off than before. I met the most amazing people in the most unlikely places ‚Äì and a part of them carries on who I am today. Most of us are unsure and like to quickly commit to an end goal because it gives us a sense of security ‚Äì steer away from that haste and embrace the feeling of insecurity!",
      "And lastly ‚Äì eight, the only lasting testimony to this journey ‚Äì me, as I leave. I‚Äôm a completely different person. I don‚Äôt take myself and my time as seriously. I take more risks and make more spontaneous decisions. IITK gave me the confidence to deal with whatever goes wrong and that the worst case is not too bad. I should thank IITK for giving me memories I look back to when I feel down. And for giving me friends for life, who I still turn to when I feel stressed.",
      "***",
      "If it wasn‚Äôt abundantly clear so far, let me spell it out for you ‚Äì I believe all these tropes and narratives are plain bullshit. They are like dots connected backwards, rationalisation of outcomes in retrospect, romanticisation of an existence and a space. They are meaningless linear narratives trying to force-fit a rather chaotic journey, an attempt to find meaning in a story full of contradictions and hypocrisy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have sneered at them for four years at Vox ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to write this!",
      "A note for Sethia, our dear former Chief Editor. There are many ways to write this, reflecting on the good times you shared with Vox, how much we have learned from you, your journey within Vox, or the times of trouble we endured during some articles (which turn into funny moments in retrospect), and of course, the legendary duo, ‚ÄúSethia and Pandeya.‚Äù But, knowing all of this and skipping the clich√©d stuff, thank you for making Vox what it is with you. We wish you¬†all¬†the¬†best.",

      "In the 31st edition of As We Leave 2024, Shreya Bhattacharya, a Y20 student from the Department of Material Science and Engineering, reflects on her college journey filled with ups and downs, expressing gratitude to those who supported her along the way.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Reflecting on four years in just a single sitting cannot do them justice. Over the course of these years, I‚Äôve evolved through various personas: the one who cries ‚ÄúF toh nahi lgega‚Äù and then gets a C+, the one who‚Äôs perpetually worried about placements, the one with a less-than-stellar track record in relationships (until recently :P), the one who wants a big fat friends group, and so on. However, for this time, I want to share what I wish someone had told me when I first got admitted to IIT Kanpur.",
      "Today, as I move to a new city to start my first ever job, I feel the same butterflies I felt during my (online) orientation. Beginning a new journey, whether it‚Äôs starting pre-school or beginning a career, comes with its own set of expectations for ourselves and our surroundings. As we grow with these experiences, it‚Äôs the people around us who turn an unfamiliar journey into a pleasant adventure and make a strange place feel like home. However, finding the right people isn‚Äôt always easy.",
      "When I began college, I sought out many seniors to ask for their experiences and advice. Like most freshers, I had the clich√© goal of changing my branch. I looked up to seniors in circuital branches, believing they were the ones to follow, to achieve success. At that time, success meant having an extraordinary academic record and securing a 30+ LPA CTC placement. Over the years, my definition of success has evolved, but back then, it was clear-cut.",
      "I WISH someone had told me thatyou don‚Äôt have to follow every piece of advice you receive.The advisor might be the most ‚Äòchaapu‚Äô and ‚Äòsorted‚Äô senior or batchmate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean their advice will suit you. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should dismiss their suggestions either, but rather decide for yourself what will be beneficial. You‚Äôll be surprised at how many different paths can lead to success. You don‚Äôt have to follow the path set by your seniors; you can forge your own.",
      "When you are in your first year, you have so much scope to explore the things you may want to pursue later. But talking to seniors who try to project their incomplete dreams on you in the form of ‚Äòmust-do‚Äô is more damaging than helpful. For a long time I misidentified these ideas as my own dreams, but I learnt the hard way that it is you and only you who can and ‚Äòshould‚Äô decide what you want to become.",
      "Despite all this, it is true that life becomes much easier if you have good people to help you at every step. I have often found peace in seniors who listened to my issues with an open mind and gave advice which best suited me.",
      "Token of Thanks: Thank youAnkitfor listening to my constant BT. I can assure you, I do much less RR now. Thank youSaadfor helping me throughout placement season, be it solving DSA questions from Japan or listening to my ‚ÄúAgar place ni hue toh?‚Äù BT.",
      "For a long time, I struggled between what I thought I should do and what I truly wanted. I poured all my energy into planning my college life based on a narrow idea of success, mainly focusing on getting a placement and prioritising it over everything else. I remember asking a senior BEFORE the beginning of classes in semester 1, ‚ÄúCoding kaise start karun? Abhi se karungi toh headstart milega naa.‚Äù Now when my juniors ask me similar queries, I find myself chuckling at their innocence but it also makes me sad becausecollege has so much more to offer than just placements.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youAmmafor hosting Zoom meets that brought college life to our doorstep, for enduring my endless chatter for hours on end and for always making me feel at home away from home.",
      "Thank youSanyamfor always answering the silliest of my questions, for always listening to my cry for help, for being my constant source of inspiration and for always being there. You are the best senior anyone could wish for.",
      "By the end of first year, I already had 3 projects in my ‚Äòresume‚Äô, an accomplishment which even fourth-year students often struggle for. But in the process, I became more and more obsessed with enhancing my resume further. I desperately wanted to join SnT teams and clubs, viewing each addition as another point in my resume.Now I can see the problem with pursuing these PORs solely for the sake of resume-building.You‚Äôll not find as many opportunities to explore your passion anywhere else as you will in college. Looking back, maybe if I hadn‚Äôt left the Music Club in the desire for what I felt were more prestigious PORs, I would have been much happier. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think it makes much of a difference anyway. In the end, you just fail to do justice with both them and yourself.",
      "All of this culminated in my worst fear coming true: I didn‚Äôt secure an internship. Despite receiving tons of shortlists, I just couldn‚Äôt crack ANY interviews. After a while, it felt like my friends, family, and even I believed something was inherently wrong with me. There were days when I wished my parents would tell me they were proud of me no matter what, instead of questioning what went wrong in the interviews, and acknowledge that I was working hard.",
      "In hindsight, not getting an internship turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The fear of failing is often worse than failure itself because once you face it, the only direction to go is up. Securing an off-campus internship eventually gave me the confidence I needed and helped me realise that life is much more than just this rat race. Ultimately, the placement semester became the best semester of my college experience. I hustled through the placement season with overwhelming support from my friends, both in preparing and having fun afterwards.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youSarath, SmritiandBaishaliand the entireFACfam for being an absolute blessing to work with.",
      "Thank you,Disha, for being the first person I talked to in college, my first roommate, and for putting up with my late-night yapping sessions.",
      "Thank youSwetafor enjoying chicken with me as much as I do, for being that one friend who I can always rely on for the best advice and for being a constant source of awe and inspiration. You are my one ‚Äòturu lob‚Äô.",
      "",
      "",
      "But I wasn‚Äôt always good at making friends. I felt quite isolated throughout my school life, which motivated me to transform my social life in college. And college was definitely different. I met some extraordinary people who taught me so much. However, even college friendships came with their own hardships.",
      "For a long time, I stayed close to friends who were no longer compatible with me. The fear of losing them outweighed the pain of keeping them around. It‚Äôs hard to imagine letting go of people we care about, but recognizing that not every friendship is healthy, despite how good the person is, is one of life‚Äôs hard lessons. Learning when to let go is a skill I‚Äôm still working on, and I hope you will master it soon too.",
      "Nonetheless, having friends who believe in you can make such a huge difference. Being around the right people is always so rewarding and healing. I believe that friendships should be simple, where you can find your safe space. I‚Äôll forever be grateful for the friends who pulled me out of my lowest points and helped me find myself again.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youSubbufor tolerating me through my ‚ÄòDrama Queen‚Äô phase. Now never call me that ever again üôÇ .",
      "Thank youShantanufor sending me countless cat reels and for teaching me what being responsible truly means. I hope corporate life treats you well XD.",
      "",
      "One feeling that has forever overshadowed my campus experience is the sense of not doing enough. Transitioning from being one of the toppers in school to being just average in college became one of my biggest insecurities. I always felt the need to do more and prove to myself that I still had what it takes. I yearned for academic validation, but it eluded me until much after I realised that the metric of success is multidimensional.",
      "Let me tell you a story. At the end of my third semester, I received my first ‚ÄòD‚Äô in ESO202: Mechanics of Solids. In retrospect, ESO202 was the worst course I ever took. Things improved from that point on, but at that moment, I hit rock bottom. I suddenly became the kind of student who gets D‚Äôs. Although I did receive D‚Äôs later on, the initial shock wasn‚Äôt as severe because I had already experienced it before.",
      "For a long time, I felt an immense burden of regret over that D. I thought, ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt received that D, maybe I would have had an 8+ CPI, and a hundred other things could have been better.‚Äù However, a shift in perspective can transform the narrative significantly. That semester, over 100 students received D‚Äôs, E‚Äôs, or F‚Äôs. If I had received an E or an F, my academic trajectory might have taken a severe downturn. There‚Äôs a good chance I would have lost confidence, seeing myself as a student who gets F‚Äôs.",
      "Looking back, I realise that D saved me. It prevented a worse outcome and became a turning point in my academic journey. Today, I am proud to say that my CPI only improved from there on.",
      "Shifting my perspective has been incredibly refreshing. Now, I no longer carry the burden of regret for not being able to switch my branch, for facing rejection in my pursuit of becoming a CTM, or for missing out on an SPO internship‚Äîevents that once brought me countless tearful nights. Undoubtedly, failure brings its share of pain, yet there‚Äôs no greater satisfaction than rising above that pain and discovering an alternate path to happiness.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youOjsi, Payal, Khoobayshee, Sweta, Adit, Naman, Bharat, Shivangand many others going through the ‚Äòphase‚Äô for making our department bearable.",
      "",
      "And thus, one day, it dawned on me how much the quality of life changes the moment you become aware of what you have achieved. After churning through the preparation for JEE, we never really get out of that constant hyper-competitive mode where nothing feels enough. Even now, as I‚Äôm about to start working at a company I actually want to work for, I still feel restless about doing nothing. It‚Äôs just how we‚Äôve become. But in this process, we often forget how far we have come.",
      "I had a habit of overthinking and reevaluating every step of my life. God knows how many times I‚Äôve wished to go back to my first day of college, where you are right now, and start over. ‚ÄúThis time I would do nothing other than study! I would change my branch to CSE, then take a research internship abroad in my second year, secure a high-paying internship in an HFT, and finally receive a PPO from there.‚Äù It has taken a very long time for me to appreciate where I am now.",
      "One day, while casually overanalyzing stuff, I realised that maybe I don‚Äôt want to change things. If I really restarted my journey, I wouldn‚Äôt be who I am today. The friends I have and the memories I‚Äôve made are too valuable to be replaced. And so, this cycle of overthinking stopped altogether.",
      "Token of Thanks:Thank youJahnfor bearing all my ‚Äòsmall‚Äô jokes and for being tiny XD. Thank youPrabhfor being the soul of every gathering and the best listener to all our problems. Thank youVyavfor being my go-to-person for anything and everything, from discussing ontology to recommending skincare, from eating biryani to drinking coffee and from hating on others to loving each other.",
      "You all are the best ‚Äòmahila mandal‚Äô anyone can ask for.",
      "Yes, it surely would have been good if everything had gone as planned. But there will always be possibilities where things could have been better than the present: a better college, a better branch, better decisions, and so on. However, consider what might have happened if you hadn‚Äôt made it this far. In some alternate universe, you might be in a private college, wishing you had made it to IIT Kanpur.",
      "From that perspective, I did live the dream, and so will you. Just remember, for every possibility where you could have done better, there are a thousand more where you would have been wishing to be where you are at the moment. After four years of experiencing the ups and downs of college life, I can emphatically say that I wouldn‚Äôt give it up for anything.",
      "Token of Thanks:And finally, Vijay ‚ÄòDJ Discobaz‚Äô Bharadwaj, thank you for waiting for me every time I was late, for bringing me medicines everytime I had a tummy ache, for always being there no matter the time and for believing in me when even I couldn‚Äôt see the good in myself. Every moment with you has been pure joy.",
      "So, my dearest Small ‚Äì Shreya, I wish that you have the courage to maintain a positive outlook, even when times are at their darkest. May your heart stay strong, and may hope guide you through the toughest moments.",
      "I am proud of you. Always.",
      "Yours,Big ‚Äì Shreya",

      "In this 30th edition of As We Leave 2024, Ishita Vyavahare, a Y20 student in the Department of Physics, takes us through a wild ride that was her college life and then tops it off with a bunch of sage advice that you can keep with you.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I wasn‚Äôt going to write an AWL until some of them came out and I realised that I had a duty to write something that told my story. Truth be told, I don‚Äôt think I can summarize my college experience in a neat 2000 words all wrapped up with a bow tie. Even if someone held a gun to my head and asked me to, I would write different versions of it depending on what time of the month it was. I don‚Äôt think I can recall everything I did in college will leave that up to the older Ishita whenever she goes into nostalgia mode. I like to think that every event changes us, reinforcing and dismantling the beliefs we have, so, every instance of college is now distilled into what (anti)lessons I have learnt.",
      "I did everything college had to offer. I religiously studied to get an A*, I slacked off to the extent that I didn‚Äôt know the name of the course till midsem, I bawled my eyes out when I couldn‚Äôt get an intern and had to stay for the summer and I smiled for days on end after having climbed the highest points in the campus, I dyed my hair pink and filled notebooks trying to feel better, I added nearly 1500 songs to my Spotify library in 4 years and I made a girlfriend family amidst self-doubts and isolation I felt after the falling out of my friend groups. I had a complete character arc in a movie that I thought to be a tragedy but was actually a coming-of-age.",
      "Me? I came in a frigid and insecure little girl, fresh outta the rat race constantly wanting to make a name for herself and simultaneously blend into the new ass-kicking machine that was this college. My first year saw me being oblivious to academic sensibility. No matter how much I tried to study the courses, I found myself scoring no more than average. It wasn‚Äôt until the midsemester exams that I realised thatiss college me koi doodh ka dhula nahi hai.Answers ke behti ganga me mere haath paav aur muh, sab dhul gaye.Make no mistake, I came to IIT Kanpur with dreams of being an academic weapon and graduate an accomplished scientist, but somehow no matter how much I tried, any effort to make meaning of anything was blotted out by the endless waves of the lockdown. Each day felt like just like any other seeing the same four walls of my room and being chronically online obsessing over pop artists and existential writers. Some things helped. I made some like-minded friends from college who to this day are with me and by me. Online clubs were actually an excuse for zoom calls of a bygone IITK practice known as ‚Äúbulla sessions‚Äù. I got neck deep into yoga (excuse the pun) and the six dog walks a day were an excuse to see daylight. This is definitely an oversimplified and reductionist telling of my first year but the essence was just this. Numb days with virtually (killing it with these puns) four real faces to see; one of which was my dog, the rest three are with me in a whatsapp group called ‚Äúgenetically related peepl‚Äù.",
      "In the first half of the second year, things started turning heating up and sides were getting polarized. People anticipated, aspired and assured themselves for campus to reopen its gates as the rest of the nation did. I remember the endless streams of memes, confessions, chat spamming that pushed the college authority to resume their normal mode. It was a fateful PHY101 online class where the professor gave us the unintended disclosure that the college will open sooner than later. I am the believer types and the prospect of seeing college made me excited. The rest is history.",
      "Seeing all my friends and this batch of 1200 faces was a little bittersweet. You see, the internet puts you in an echo chamber of people like you, who use the same slang as you, who listen to your cool-deep-meaning-but-chill-rock-rap-beats kinda music, who are politically and socially pretty much homogenous. I realised in campus the sheer enormity of the type of friend groups, course choices, club and council choices, conversation choices, dressing sense choices, food choices, sleep schedule choices, humor types, attachment styles, priorities, backgrounds and chai preferences. This was a simulation of the real world. So many people turned out to be vastly different in appearance and demeanor than their online selves. Coupled with this was the huge break that Sincere Studying‚Ñ¢had taken in my life. You know? The kinds where you enter a flow state and can‚Äôt stop? Anyways, I questioned if my career-choice and the life I had envision is still what I wanted. I fucked around and tried to find out. Fourth semester went by in the blink of an eye and it brought even more questions and a truckload of self-doubts. I honestly became morose in college, I yearned to learn something but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what I wanted and was constantly overwhelmed. I went back home for the summer and decided to truly start Sincerely Studying‚Ñ¢. I took on the POR of my dreams (ELS coordinator) I also changed how I looked, dispelled with the things that made me hate myself and came back for my third year feeling fresher than ever. For the lack of a better term, I had a glow up.",
      "Third year saw me scrambling to have the research intern of my choice and struggling to keep up, yetgoddaminitagain to understand my courses, feeling more and more socially inept and unable to do justice to the POR I had. Most of my friend groups had fragmented around then and even my one-on-one friendships were going through their own separate agnipariksha. Campus chipped into my armor one strike and one day at a time, my glow up felt superficial. I won‚Äôt lie, I had become familiar with this sinking feeling and almost found a sort of comfort in it. There was plenty of gen z humor and art that made me feel heard so I spent a year in this feeling. I questioned more than ever what I wanted to do with my life. The vision of me being a scientist was dwindling and I found myself drawn to fashion, music and politics because for once, something felt relevant to my life. I stayed the following summer, did courses strategically and introspected. A lyric stuck with me that spoke my language of pessimism but was at the same time, empowering, ‚ÄúGod loves you, but not enough to save you. ‚ÄúI took the decision to sit in the coming placement season with a vengeance. This placement season was going to be my bitch.",
      "Enter seventh semester. Now more than ever, I Sincerely Studied‚Ñ¢for tests. I also reconciled with friends and talked things out. I still had to shed off the traces of self-doubt but going in, but had I learnt to let go. I had anxious breakdowns but they waxed and waned. I think here is the time I had an attitude glow-up. I embraced happiness as a necessary part of anything instead of sitting in my pit of sorrow and took it one day at a time. Come December of 2023 and I bagged my first job with my first interview. I never held myself in high regard but that moment was precious and life-shaping. I felt happy plain and simple.",
      "The last semester was a spa session with my girls and herbal therapy all the way. I went on my first and last college trip. I was the chilliest, most easygoing I had ever been. I still probe that the question, ‚Äúwhat is it that I want to do with my life?‚Äù to this day and I have made some headway. This was the closure I got from college. This place has shaped me but did not define me. I had, in my own right, had undergone a process of confrontational self-discovery and this ass kicking machine has made my glutes very resilient. You can end reading this AWL here and I suggest you do. Come back another day and maybe look at the rest of this piece with a clean palette.",
      "Here are a list of the lessons and anti-lessons that I learnt along the way. They are mostly one liners so make of them what you will.",

      "In this edition of As We Leave 2024, Nishant Roshan, a Y20 student from the Computer Science department talks about his journey at IITK, from the online to offline classes, his experiences with different clubs and changing halls, and about the value of real friendships.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "My earliest memory of AWL articles goes back to somewhere in around the summers of 2021 when the Y17‚Äôs were graduating, and I was just another fresher kid trying to look up to their journey. Each year as the AWL awl articles were released, I took a genuine interest in reading a few of them and trying to learn from the mistakes of my seniors. But you know what, the funny part is that neither of those readings prevented me from doing my own part of foolishness nor do I remember any of the lessons from any AWL. So to be brutally honest, just like reading the AWLs of my seniors didn‚Äôt help me, reading anything I write here won‚Äôt help you ‚ò∫. So I‚Äôll just be selfish enough to use this article as my own diary of my IITK journey (for the purpose of nostalgia a few years down the line) and do a bit of ‚Äúgyan chodna‚Äù in between, for my juniors desperate to learn something here xD.",
      "Me? I used to study all my days, and nights out to score somewhere among the highest CPIs in first year, while being the same guy who received plagiarism in multiple courses in my junior and final year. I have avoided the seniors I found indulging in drugs, while someday I had to be hospitalized for being too high on several substances. I once weighed 85kgs and once 70kgs. I have seen myself away and ignoring girls while also deeply in affection with one of them. I have seen all passing grades, been high on every substance available on campus and fallen asleep in every course I‚Äôve attended. Read on.",
      "Online, covid and first few semesters:",
      "Y19 and Y20 are the batches which suffered the most from covid-19. Our jee was postponed by about 2-3months, our first 3 semesters were ‚Äústudy from home‚Äù and our minds were the most fucked up. Calling these beginning semesters as ‚Äúcollege days‚Äù is somewhat farce. These were the days I was readily gaining weight, eating during the days and watching movies/web series during the nights. There were just two upsides of this online period. The first one, obviously we got to spend a lot of time with our families. The second one, we had lots and lots of time. This means that, even if studying was your last priority, you would somehow find time to study as there were not many other things to do. My only interaction during these days were with my few coaching friends and the IITK peeps in my hometown. However, these interactions were mostly limited to online chatting only. We managed to have a couple of meet ups with college peeps in my hometown, but that was just two or three times in total. This was the time I started playing guitar, playing lawn tennis and binge watching any series I started up with.",
      "Just as every other first year student, I was trying to enter almost all the possible clubs and teams. Although it is easy to get involved in a club or society, it‚Äôs difficult to maintain giving effort and being involved in any of them. So ultimately though I was initially involved in a few teams, projects and made it to a secretary in a few clubs, I didn‚Äôt continue with any single POR in my 3rdyear. The decision of whether to hold a POR or not, I would leave up to the reader. It all depends on your course load, your priority to socialise, and your interests. For me, the clubs in the online time seemed mundane. I may have been more involved in them, had things been offline, but still, I have no regrets about not being in one.",
      "Having a good JEE background, I found most of the courses easy to comprehend with just a little bit of effort. Not to mention, this was the time, I was sweeping easy A and A* grades in most courses. The first blow to my confidence came in the ESC101 and ESO207 courses. These were coding and algorithm courses. This was the domain I wasn‚Äôt much exposed to. So here is the first bit of advice I would give to my juniors:",
      "‚ÄúYour success or failure in future does not depend on your successes or failures of your past. It just depends on what you are doing at present.‚Äù",
      "So basically avoid being over confident just because you have been excellent in the past. You may observe someone way below you in the success hierarchy overtakes you soon enough. But this works the other way round as well, i.e., if you are finding yourself below a lot of your peers, then be assured that being successful is not their birthright. You may soon overtake most of them by some constant effort.",
      "Campus, the 4thsemester, and those H12 days:",
      "It was the 4thsemester when we saw campus for the first time. Believe me it was way more beautiful than I had expected. I still clearly remember my first day here: It was a fine morning in the first week of January 2022. All the roads were filled with fog and we had to walk from the Health centre to H12 after getting approval for our covid vaccination. That was the first long walk with my two other friends on the roads of IITK. Although my parent hall is H3, <3, we were made to stay at H12 for one semester as a part of quarantine during the covid. This was the semester I first attended an offline lecture at L20, gave my first offline exam and received my first and only D grade.",
      "The Hall 3 days:",
      "I decided to stay at campus during the summers after 4thsemester and took up a course of HSS. These were the days all our batchmates were mostly busy in intern preparation, while I was managing the course, a project under some CSE prof, intern preparation and heartbreak, all simultaneously. Obviously when the intern tests started, my preparation was not up to the mark. I was almost certain of not getting an intern. However, my preparation wasn‚Äôt as fucked up as I had expected and I got an internship on the first day. Although all my friends and roommate had a better company in their basket, I bet they weren‚Äôt in as manic of a situation as I was in. So ultimately if I compare the efforts given vs results, I will say that I am satisfied there.",
      "For our summers, 5thand 6thsemesters, we were shifted to our parent halls. Mine was hall 3. One thing I can definitely tell you for sure, the Y20 is one of the most chaapu batch Hall 3 has received. Whichever wing you go to, you would see multiple people involved in several different campus activities. Some may be active in sports, some in senate politics, some in acads while others in GC. Maybe that‚Äôs the culture which hall 3 propagates. Maybe that‚Äôs the reason every other hall is spiteful of us. Leaving the GC and hall rivalry apart, it was a great experience being among the people of H3.",
      "The 5thand 6thsemesters at CSE IITK are one of the most hectic. Most of my time went into attending classes, preparing for quizzes and trying not to lag. It was sometimes intimidating when I used to see so many wingies around me being involved in so many campus activities, while I was just trying to cope up with my courses. For instance, my roommate himself was someone with a CPI almost very close to 10 in my same branch. Most of those days were spent in the inferiority complexes as to why I did fuck up. That was the time I, for the first time felt the regret that I should have focused more on CPI than on other things. In the retrospect when I look at those days I feel all the tension of assignments and quizzes were futile. Had I been a bit coolheaded, the results would have had been better.",
      "So here is the final advice I would give to any junior reading this:",
      "‚ÄúTake any CSE related assignment, be it ML, systems or algorithm related, the most important step is to start it. If you think you are lagging in some concepts or theory, believe me, everyone is on the same boat.‚Äù",
      "So rather than stressing about anything, just begin and keep on googling things you don‚Äôt know. In no time you will be deep into it.",
      "The final year:",
      "Although most of my wingies were moving to Hall 1 during this time, my closest friend circle was a group of guys whose parent hall was 2 and they were choosing to move to hall 9. In no time, I decided to move to their wing and chose hall 9. Believe me, sometimes being with chill and calm people is much better than being with the chaapu and active ones. These guys were not much involved in any campus activity like my previous wingies, however, I found joy in simple mundane activities with them. These could be a simple walk after dinner, or 10 guys sitting in a room and everyone having their part of humour.",
      "These friends from Hall 2 are the ones I am going to take with me all my life. They are the guys I can rely on. These are the guys I can make fun of. These are the guys I can go on a trip with. One should always know that it‚Äôs not being chaapu or famous on campus which would give you pleasure. It‚Äôs having someone around you, someone you can talk to and someone you can rely on which gives you that pleasure. If you have friends like these, then having a girlfriend or a boyfriend becomes redundant. Having such friends is much better than being in a relationship, as these are the people you don‚Äôt ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù with.",
      "So my final piece of gyaan:",
      "‚ÄúNo matter what, you must make good friends here. These should not be the ideal chaapu people, but these should be the guys who belong 100% to you and with whom you feel a bliss‚Äù",
      "‚ÄúSo whoever has sustained reading this article till this point, I bid my final farewell to ya. It has been a great journey. As I myself look forward to walk down another phase of life, I‚Äôll always always be open for you. Whether I know you or not, just text me whenever you wish to, you will always be welcomed. Adios IITK!!!‚Äù",

      "Mohammad Saad, a Y19 BS-MS student in the department of Physics, talks about his views on the mechanisms of IITK, the Student Senate, the Gymkhana and how he would like to see the campus community thrive.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Thanks for the above disclaimer; much needed. For me, an AWL is a message that someone would leave behind as they leave the campus. I write this with that background thought. A mirror to the life I tried to live. This piece will also remind me of my principles when I look back. Reading this, you might feel I am too old for my age. I agree with you. I do feel old, especially on this ‚Äúyoung‚Äù campus. And I write this while taking my high BP and high heart rate pills and scratching my head, which has succumbed to severe hair fall. (To lighten the mood regularly, I have added some of my clicks around the campus, which you all liked. Since this is kind of a non-personal AWL, there is no point in putting my group photos.)",
      "I shall keep my life story short because I do not wish to make this the usual personal-life-AWL; you‚Äôll have many of those with more profound lives. So, I got here into MechEngg. Did a bunch of stuff in my first year (clubs, GC, etc.), scored 0/50 in PHY103 midsem, and then changed my branch to BS PHY because I felt I wanted to do physics. I had no rational basis for doing so, just a belief that even if it turned out wrong, I‚Äôm capable of finding my way through. Then I did some department courses, realised that I like ‚Äústudying‚Äù Physics, took a SURGE project, which got ruined. Entered 3rd year with zero progress, applied for an internship in over 100 places, got rejected from everywhere, spent 6th semester with academic and emotional losses, and then went home while the rest went for their internships. Meanwhile, I started a project under a new professor, which turned out decent. Continued that and decided to do a Dual Degree because I did not even have enough LoRs for PhD applications. Finally got selected for MITACS in 4th year, saw off my graduating friends, had a great summer, came back, decided to leave research and sit for placements, pulled out three days before resume submission, applied for PhDs, and after a long wait, got in.",
      "That was academics; non-academically, I kept on doing something or the other all the while. Became secy at a few places (specially SnT, which began my four-years-long and deep connection with SnT), then a coordinator at my beloved AstroClub, did Inter-IITs, unexpected leadership at Science CoffeeHouse in 4th year, taught at Prayas, and gave my blood to the department as a DUGC nominee. Somehow, through all of this, many people got to know me, and I got to interact with a gazillion souls. Can I say I fulfilled the childish fantasy of being ‚Äúcollege famous‚Äù? Well, I don‚Äôt care. It just felt like I got fitted into the ‚Äúgodfather‚Äù role towards the end, which could be false, but I felt that way. This starkly contrasted with the identity crisis I felt in my first year, and I am happy that I could grow in that sphere. I mention this entire story just for the sake of that one reader who might be looking for answers to related questions and I could provide one‚Äîeven a single one matters.",
      "Firstly, every senior you meet will call his IITK years ‚Äúthe golden era‚Äù. Y16s call the pre-Y17 era the best; you know why. Y19s call pre-covid times ‚Äúthe golden era‚Äù. I do not know about Y20/21. I prefer not to call my era the best. Were the pre-covid IITK years the best? Probably not. So, never fall prey to that gaslighting. It is better to discuss specific features that changed across two eras and then choose your poison.",
      "I believe elections at IITK should be paused for a few years to allow the campus to heal. Throughout my stay, I have not found elections beneficial to the community. We need student representatives but not elected ones, especially not on the votes gathered through an empty manifesto, substances, and friendship/community voting. Why should a random Joe with no interest or stakes in SnT vote for the SnT Gensec? How does his vote even matter in this case? Instead of laying my faith in the electoral system, I prefer to lay it in the council core team and the interviewing panel, even though they are not immune to corruption. IITK elections are a waste of resources and students‚Äô money. During the 1-1.5 months of elections, all Gymkhana activities, even small club events, are restricted. All of this just to elect some clowns whose sole reason for winning was to grab an offer in a consulting firm because they could not learn to code in their four years.",
      "I can convince myself not to hate consulting roles (except that they have hijacked Linkedin with their superfluous gyaan posts), nor do I mind people taking up positions that would aid them in landing such a role. What bothers me is the rampantselling of consultancy, which had ill effects on the Gymkhana. Earlier, such firms did not come for placements, and a handful would apply off-campus. The campus was relatively better then. Now, they also hire in internship drive, worsening the condition further. Since the positions were taken only to get a consulting job, the position holder forgets his responsibilities once he lands a role. Why would he even care now? The incentive is now already acquired.",
      "The collective good no longer seems to be the reason for anyone taking up positions. It seems to be all just for the sake of a one-page resume. It pains me when a first-year kid asks how some XYZ club or Inter-IIT Tech Meet can help his resume. We have confined them to a narrow thinking direction, and then later on, they feel the perils of the ‚Äúrat race‚Äù that we created.How can Takneek or Galaxy improve my resume?It is not supposed to. Do it for the sake of your interests, for your Hall. Get that Inter-IIT gold for your institute, for yourself. In doing so, pick up the skills to help your resume. I hope such a culture does not exist where an Inter IIT OC conveniently fills half of his resume with Inter IIT pointers even before the Inter IIT has taken place or even some ground-level progress has been made.",
      "In my opinion, freshers must participate in GC as long as they can manage themselves. But how will they participate? The counselling service will separate them from seniors for over a month: no GBM or preparation for Takneek. Isn‚Äôt this also a blanket action? Where is the outrage as it was in the case of the H13 warden banning female entry? The CS should instead focus on better training of SGs and AMs. Amongst the many SGs and AMs I have encountered so far, most SGs themselves are unaware of scholarships and academic structures, which are important to a fresher, and the AMs are least interested in teaching and helping individual cases. This is probably explained by the fact that the applications are mostly due to the ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù if you are not an SG. I believe there must be a maximum income criterion for SG and CTMs. An upper-class sobo cannot possibly understand the perils of a lower class and is expected to be unaware of MCM and FBM.",
      "We have been imitating the West in many ways. So, why do we not take their career structure? No fully-fledged organised on-campus recruitments. You should be capable enough of landing a job yourself. In today‚Äôs date, getting rid of the placements might be a bit far-fetched. But at least we can try removing the dedicated internship drive, which is, at best, spoon-feeding. The first year goes into understanding the campus, the second year goes into worrying about ‚Äúprojects‚Äù for internships, and the third year onwards, placements start to hit. Students lose their confidence when they cannot get an internship in a dedicated drive, while others do. They do not realise that only 1/3rd were supposed to get one. So, are the IITs incapable of training their students into independent job seekers? That would be quite sad because, due to the advent of IITs, most central and state universities have fallen deep into negligence today while once they were the nation‚Äôs charm. If the University of Allahabad were once called ‚ÄúOxford of the East‚Äù, it would have been for a reason.",
      "This leads me to the current status of academics at IITK. In a few words, it can be better and tougher. I‚Äôd prefer to have quality over quantity. I‚Äôll state this beforehand: I am all in to have proper regulations to counter professors‚Äô and admin‚Äôs autocracy. This piece is to be read by students, so there‚Äôs no point in discussing the other side. I feel that, over the years, fewer and fewer students are going forward with their majors. Not being interested in the parent domain is fine; it is a class 12th kid‚Äôs decision, after all. But what appears to me is there are no efforts to develop an interest at all. Seemingly, the already set and prevalent path is a common choice. Most of the UGs do not even care about their major. They only want a professor not to teach, easy grades, and an easy graduation. There should be more Fs, you don‚Äôt get sad because you got an F, you get sad because very few got an F, and you were among them. The institute has even scrapped the termination policy for the UGs; after some semesters, you‚Äôll be thrown out of campus (maximum residency), still slogging over your degree, and they‚Äôll milk the money out of you. However, I should say that the Exit Degree Option is indeed a good initiative.",
      "A better support structure should exist for those who genuinely find academics difficult even after trying. But, if you say a professor is horrible for giving an F in your last semester while you did not even care to put in effort, you are objectively wrong. An IITK student of a specific subject with not even an ounce of subject knowledge should not be allowed to graduate and tarnish the name of the degree. I know professors who went out of their way to teach the students who found difficulty learning despite their efforts, but they were defamed because they graded slightly harsher than a professor who distributed free grades. There are too many fests and other non-academic events throughout the year. And while you invoke that cliche Dead Poets Society quote, I agree non-academics and entertainment are essential. But not in this sheer quantity in an academic institution. Our time and efforts are better suited to other avenues rather than self-indulged frolics. The ever-increasing batch size is another nail in the coffin. Resources are the same, classrooms are getting bigger, and the quality is decreasing. IITK should not be just a job centre but an education hub. The former follows along. And education that does not serve the community is futile",
      "As I leave, I just request you to be vigilant, vocal, and proactive about the activities around you, whether admin‚Äôs or Gymkhana‚Äôs. Keep your position holders in check, especially your executives and your senators. You should step up and ask how an item worth a lakh or two suddenly gets lost and then written off from the inventory. It came from your Gymkhana fee. When I entered IITK, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be corrupt like other government setups. But I was wrong. From admin to students. Tell me, how many of you have faked income certificates to get MCM or Donor, even though you know you‚Äôll earn well after graduation if you work the bare minimum? And this is just one of many things. Also,make good friends in the senate. In my judgment, the 2023-24 UG AnC Gensec did negligible work in the tenure, and no one moved an impeachment, but hell went loose when a PG got duly elected as the Chairperson. The long-forgotten Gymkhana Constitution was returned to life to get the new chair ousted. I am indifferent to the person or his/her credentials; it is the procedure and partial treatment that upsets me.Dosti-yaari senate much?The SSAC, supposed to be a judiciary, has been turned into a threat machinery.",
      "I do not know much about Y18s and above, but I did observe the destructive precedence of arbitrary power abuse and political control set by the Y19 executives. That precedence has been successfully taken up by the Y20 executives and made even worse, as could be seen in the 2023-24 Even semester. (I think executives should leave campus as soon as the end of their exams; their prolonged stay has proven harmful). What scares me is how far the Y21s will take it, I pray they don‚Äôt. In an environment with healthy journalism, individual whistleblowers would not be needed. The Vox had been on its deathbed under the Y18s and Y19s. I commend their recent recovery, which has been a ray of hope. But I feel their ethos much constrains them, and they need to let it loose, albeit with the faith that their biases are away, and thus, do journalism with a spine.",
      "So who are the culprits? Your executives, the senate, the position holders, you and me. All of us are. We, the seniors, have glorified multiple PORs as chaapuness. We, the seniors, have glorified only high packages as success. We, the seniors, have made the juniors think only about their resumes. We, the seniors, have taught our juniors how to play dirty politics, so much so that it might ruin a student‚Äôs career. The onus is on the seniors to set good precedence for the juniors. If the students say the admin woke up after three suicides, then the students also woke up after three suicides. It is easy to make an outcry in heated blood, but the need is for systemic efforts from our side to bring reforms ‚Äî incremental efforts in our own spheres: committees, clubs, councils, and so on. I have tried to be indifferent but still feel for this place. Yes, I would love to see my IITK be great.",
      "I‚Äôll simply end with a couplet close to my heart, penned by Allama Iqbal, whom I highly admire.",
      "ÿ≥ÿ®ŸÇ Ÿæ⁄æÿ± Ÿæ⁄ë⁄æ ÿµÿØÿßŸÇÿ™ ⁄©ÿß ÿπÿØÿßŸÑÿ™ ⁄©ÿß ÿ¥ÿ¨ÿßÿπÿ™ ⁄©ÿß",

      "Sabaq phir padh sadaaqat ka, adaalat ka, shujaat ka",
      "Liya jaega tujh se kaam duniya ki imaamat ka",
      "Read again the lesson of truth, of justice and valour!",
      "You will be asked to take on responsibility for the world.",
      "May Allah bless us all and strengthen us to deliver justice.",
      "PS: I know such articles do not work on the masses. I do not even intend to. We only need a handful of noble souls. And I have not been perfect as well. I also made mistakes and could not do the fullest to serve this place, for which I am apologetic. However, that should not bar anyone from speaking up.",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It was 14thJune 2019, results of JEE Advanced just declared and the dream of yet another JEE Aspirant got shattered. Well, it was one of the toughest phases since my family expected a lot from me. My scores in Mains & BITSAT were not good enough either. I started searching for what other options I have. A State Rank of 90 could only get me admission in the CSE Department of the best private college of Chhattisgarh, BIT Durg. I still remember the staff saying,‚Äú1stAugust se classes hai, subah 9 Baje aa jana‚Äù.",
      "It was something I never imagined having happened to me. On 10thJuly, I decided totake another shot at my life, the last phase of Allen‚Äôs droppers‚Äô batch was beginning from 17th. Grateful and glad that my parents supported me blindly in this decision of mine. Booked the tickets for 15th, reached Kota on 16th, joined classes from 17thJuly‚Äô19 and never looked back again.",
      "Our classes officially commenced on 18thNovember‚Äô20 and a tragedy followed immediately. I lost my grandfather on 19thNovember, Covid proved to be a boon in the sense I could rush to my hometown and be there with my family in their toughest phase, especially my father.",
      "I lagged in academics and missed out on most of the fun events that followed for obvious reasons, and I really don‚Äôt regret it at all, the last rites of my grandfather were of utmost importance during that phase and my father needed me the most that time.",
      "I missed out so much that I was added to my department WhatsApp group post first Mid-Semester Examinations. I hardly knew anyone in the college apart from my wingies. However, the MSE group welcomed me quite warmly and I finally had my first set of friends by the end of first semester. I too started having all night online Bulla Sessions with them and finally found a way to escape from the concept of‚Äòfear of missing out‚Äô.",
      "I never cheated during my 1styear at college and proudly accepted myCsin MTH & PHY103 andDin LIF. I was still in the delusion that I have conquered JEE and that‚Äôs it, my life goal is achieved, it doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs your CPI here, after all you‚Äôre an IITian, this was soon broken when I reached campus on 30thDecember‚Äô21.",
      "Post reaching campus, things changed drastically, especially for our Batch, Y20s. Most of the people came to know that who were theirrealfriends, as once you are offline, your priorities are no more private to you, they become public, and it was hard for many people to digest the fact that the equality of our set of online friends & offline friends did not hold true.",
      "However, I was lucky/grateful enough that I always had my wingies to fall back upon and my online interaction was limited to very few people, which made the transition easier.‚ÄòAlways expect the worst and you‚Äôll end up staying happy‚Äô,is one of the Ideologies that I believe in, expectations kill joy.",
      "I had performed in my school a lot and wanted to explore dramatics here too. It was in online mode that I became the Secretary of the Dramatics Club. It was definitely a huge learning curve and I‚Äôm glad/proud to have taken that decision, no regrets at all. Well, things changed quickly and drastically when we came offline as secretaries of Fursat Mandli. The long practice hours were something very new to me, but I enjoyed the interaction and the common goal of learning & growing as artists held us together.",
      "Not everything was so smooth, we had to mentor Y21s in a fresher event and every 2-3 secretaries worked as a team by having a set of juniors as mentees. A multilogue and a sketch was to be performed by them under our guidance. In one of the online meets, while mentoring and giving tips to improve to Y21s, I fumbled, I fumbled bad, even said lines which were not meant to be, I immediately turned my video and mic off, just listened thereafter, my team handled it well after that, but I fell into the deepest well of self-doubt. That phase was tough, and I kept doubting what impression the Y21 batch would be having of me, that mole of self-doubt, though much smaller now, still remains.",
      "One can always make mistakes, even while mentoring, be it a senior from any batch, after all we‚Äôre human beings, what matters is how you take it, you can be in an endless loop of self-doubt or decide to move on and forget it as a bad dream, which is definitely not easy, you just need to be around people who believe in you & lift you up. Talking it out to them may be tough, but it‚Äôll definitely be helpful.",
      "Nevertheless, once the Covid outbreak settled in campus, we were all set to perform our first Nukkad Natak, ‚ÄòKoop Manduk‚Äô. What a blissful experience it was, I consider it as a privilege, not everyone gets it, especially under the tag of ‚ÄòFursat Mandli‚Äô. The endless night outs of practice, Y19s, Y18s even Y17s in their last few days at campus, were all putting everything they could to make us learn what actuallyDramatics Club, IITKused to be (before Covid). The Chai-Aloo Paratha breaks between practice gave us yet another core memory, the experiences that Y17s-Y18s shared was worth listening to, Y19 Coordinators were always there for us. The energy of the people there is surreal.",
      "Performing a Nukkad, makes you ready for the toughest situation you‚Äôll ever face in campus, the bonds that you make, remain forever. I just performed one Nukkad in my entire time in Fursat Mandli and never went to practice post that due to my other priorities, yet the connections rather friendship remains, even in my final semester, they made me feel like I never left. No junior has ever seen me perform live & I missed performing again with these people.",
      "Once a senior said,‚ÄòDramatics Club kuch nahi toh Time Management zarur sikha deta‚Äôand I can proudly second that now, by saying the same to my juniors.",
      "I have been extremely enthusiastic about cricket since childhood and played tennis ball cricket in my hometown, mostly as a fast bowler. After coming here, I decided to give it a try but professional cricket here was literally a different ball game altogether. It was the first time that I played with a leather ball.",
      "We were just in campus, around January‚Äô22, some of the cricket enthusiasts from our batch went to the PE Ground to explore the facilities we have. We went to the cement pitch in the nets and were playing with tennis ball as we used to play in our halls. One day, the institute team was practicing in the main pitch (open nets) and when we entered the ground, the coach called us and wanted us field for the team, although the ball was different, fielding is something I always enjoyed. Post the session, the coach asked us our expertise in the game, I said I‚Äôll bowl leg spin, as I knew this ball was heavy and I cannot ball fast without proper control with it. But, as soon as I bowled my first leg spin delivery, I knew I‚Äôll be thrown out of here as the bowl didn‚Äôt pitch, it directly reached the keeper‚Äôs gloves as if I was giving a catch. I tried again, no control. The coach then asked if I could do something else, then I told him that I used to bowl fast with the tennis ball. He said to try the same with this ball too, I was a bit anxious at first but thought that anyways I‚Äôll be out so why not give it a shot. Then I took my run-up and bowled with all the effort I could, the ball pitched this time and bounced to a height no one expected, everyone looked with a shock, and the coach said to come again. I once again bowled and everyone was again taken aback with the pace the ball travelled, I couldn‚Äôt believe that it was this easy to bowl with the leather ball. The coach asked me to come for team practice from the next day.",
      "I bowled out the captain of the Institute Cricket Team during my first practice session & soon became a permanent member of the 16-member squad that represented IIT Kanpur in Cricket. I got my first gold medal in Udghosh‚Äô21 (1stto 3rdApril‚Äô22) without playing a single match, chicken dinner with zero kills as you may call it, kind of Khaleel Ahmed in this T20WC. This was followed by another gold in Spardha‚Äô21 (IIT-BHU Sports Fest: 15thto 17thApril‚Äô22) and yet another gold in Udghosh‚Äô22 (14thto 16thOctober‚Äô22), in which I had significant contributions. By the time we reached Inter-IIT, I was the lead pacer of the team, it was something I could not even imagine in my dreams. My first two overs in our opening match were maiden, first one being a wicket-maiden, though it didn‚Äôt matter much because we soon got eliminated in our first knockout game. That phase taught us a lot, maybe we were just too overconfident and considered others too weak.",
      "The next year‚Äôs UDGHOSH was meant to be forgotten, we stood 4th, nothing to be proud of as we lost two consecutive medal matches. I injured my left ankle & right groin during the last match of the tournament. Whenever I tried to practice, the pain would come up, even after days of resting. I wanted to play my last Inter-IIT anyhow, but I couldn‚Äôt even show up for a single practice game between Udghosh‚Äô23 (6thto 8thOctober‚Äô23) and Inter-IIT Camp (26thNovember), which made my chances of selection worse. But I wanted to play anyhow, then I figured out that if my leg fits very tightly in my shoes, my ankle won‚Äôt get strained, that was it. I wore 4 socks on my left leg along with an ankle support to start bowling. Eventually things started working out. My role was changed from an opening bowler to a death one. I knew my groin was weak, I wore crepe bandage tightly across my right groin too, to avoid any mishaps. I started playing some matches in the camp and was super happy that I was able to bowl with my full strength and also did justice to my assigned role, finally my ticket to Gandhinagar was confirmed. Meanwhile, my teammates and captain always had my back, they trusted me & my skills blindly.",
      "Then came the ultimate, IISM‚Äô23, in which we finally earned a podium finish. I played the entire tournament with the same setup, 4 socks & an ankle support on my left ankle & a tightly wound crepe bandage across my right groin. Though we completed our revenge with Madras in the 3rdPlace match, our team deserved to win Gold. We lost the semi-final against Roorkee by just 1 run, when 2 were required off the final delivery. I ended up being the second highest wicket-taker of the tournament. This tournament will always remain closest to my heart as I was not fit enough, yet the team backed me and brought the best out of me and ofcourse, we finally got an Inter-IIT Medal before leaving.",
      "I still enjoy bowling and very recently clicked approximately 135 kmph during a practice session. So, if you want to face some bouncers, I am always up at 9179234505.",
      "Cricket taught me that one should always try whatever he/she likes or has the passion for, you never know where you‚Äôll land if you don‚Äôt even give it a shot. I never bowled with a leather ball before IITK.",
      "Well, after I was done with my secretary tenure at Dramatics and was finally settled in the Institute Cricket Team, it was now time to do what I dreamt of from 1styear.",
      "I would not be lying when I say that, from the day I became a Student Guide, I always wanted to become a Core Team Member just because things seemed so easy from their point of view, you just order the AMs/SGs and the job is done, I too wanted to do what they were doing. When I applied for the post of Core Team Member, I didn‚Äôt even know that there‚Äôs something called Position of Responsibility (PoR) in college and people can mention it in their resume, I was so underexposed.",
      "Well, things fell in place somehow and I was finally a CTM. The year after that was the most memorable one, I only knew 1-2 of my 21 teammates but soon after ‚ÄòWE‚Äô clicked. My work ethics helped me gain respect from my colleagues, my coordinators too & soon I was friends with most of them, yet I would not say that I gelled up very well because I had my cricket practice all year along & that somewhat refrained me from giving those extra bonding hours to my team, yet they never ever made me feel left out & took good care of me all year along, after all it was CS.",
      "Guidance work was something I really looked up to, I loved talking to my mentees and it was one of the best things that CS did to me. When you talk to students struggling and know what they‚Äôve actually gone/going through, your own life seems so simple and easy, you feel privileged, you start acknowledging/noticing all the small, good things that have happened to you and you become grounded. One must not always wish something to God, sometimes we just need to thank them for whatever has happened/is happening, if everything seems right, just thank them, you don‚Äôt always need to wish for things to happen.",
      "When we finished selecting our new Core Team (Y21s), I attended a few of their meetings. I admired them a lot, they gave me the motivation to climb a step higher and to go for the post of Coordinator, Counselling Service.",
      "When I became the Coordinator, I was much more confident than in the case of a CTM. I was a huge fan of all my co-coordinators who soon turned into my best friends on campus. I made up for the lost bonding hours this time. They were the four gems whom I‚Äôve always looked up to & were always there whenever I needed them to be. My junior team was adorable, always super proud of them, they made me learn so much and honestly speaking, my coordinator tenure made me grow much more as a person than my CTM tenure, maybe because of spending more time together with the team, better connect with the Head, CS and of course hearing to the perspectives of my junior team, all added up. Writing of the junior team reminds me of Y22s, they‚Äôre even more adorable, glad about them already, they just make me feel older. My Team here (Y19s, Y20s, Y21s, Y22s) gave me perspectives that I could‚Äôve never imagined and depths I would have never dived into, glad that I met them.",
      "From not getting an Orientation ourselves to conducting 4 Sky Photos (Y20, Y21, Y22 & Y23), we graduated. CS literally gave me the best set of people to bond to and connect with and I‚Äôll forever be grateful for it. It was always about the people that make CS what it is, and I am really glad that I was a part of it.",
      "Will never forget the DE Practice sessions and the walks that followed during the last semester, yet another core memory.",
      "Honestly speaking, I never prepared properly for my internship drive. I focused on just doing the things which I had in my hand, in the best possible way. I was delusional and believed in the fact that I had enough on my resume, relied too much on those two gold medals, PoR of CTM & Secretary Dramatics Club and some normal SnT, PPOC projects, but I later realized that this was never enough for a Non-Tech profile. I hardly had any knowledge of DSA. Once the season started, I felt the importance of CPI too, it was 7.3 after my 4thsemester.",
      "Not getting shortlisted for interviews never really bothered me throughout the drive, I was happily enjoying the success of my Wingies and my co-Core Team Members. I was so engrossed in CS and my Cricket practice that I never focused on preparing seriously. I considered that I didn‚Äôt deserve an Intern as I saw others who had prepared seriously and are still struggling, that phase was more tough for them & I tried to help in every way possible. There was always a sense of self-doubt that my resume was really that bad that I didn‚Äôt even deserve an interview, but I had things which kept me busy and that helped, by not getting a chance/time to think about it.",
      "Soon the spring semester started, and I was yet to get a call for my first interview. Back of the mind I knew, this is the make-or-break phase and hence decided to leave cricket for this semester and focus on myself completely. Yet, even in Phase-II, there was not much movement. I enjoyed my MSE Labs a lot & wanted to explore the Core Sector. Schlumberger (SLB), Tata Steel, & SAIL were few companies in my mind that wanted to target and Vedanta & JSW had already hired.",
      "And luckily one fine day, SPO organized its first Placement Fest, called Samvardhan and SLB, previously Schlumberger came out of nowhere. The took resumes on a google form sent via mail and I was glad that could update it with my latest CPI of 7.5 and added all my MSE DEs in the relevant coursework section, I took four of them simultaneously in my 6thSemester to get ready for placements at least.",
      "My resume finally got shortlisted for the first time & I got to know this when I received 5 missed calls on my phone to come to the GD Round that morning. I knew that if I get shortlisted in any company, I‚Äôll definitely convert it. I had that much self-confidence in me, though I never imagined that it‚Äôll take so long to get an interview. My GD went significantly well, and I was finally called for my first Interview. It was a fun experience as I fumbled a bit when they talked around my projects but as they moved towards my achievements in cricket and tenure as a CTM, I gained the confidence back. I even delivered my only dialogue from ‚ÄòKoop Manduk‚Äô during my interview. Finally, I ended up having an offer till the evening.",
      "One thing that Intern season taught me was, that if you are doing justice to what you‚Äôve actually signed up for & doing it with full commitment, eventually things will fall into place in some way or the other. Enjoy others‚Äô success and never blame someone else for your own shortcomings. Not giving up till the very end kept me going and I finally got my chances.",
      "My CPI after 3 online semesters was 7.5 and I was cruising smoothly around it (7.5, 7.6 and 7.4 in my first three semesters). Things got overwhelming when I got here. I was secretary at the Dramatics Club and a fresh member of the Institute Cricket Team too. So, from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM I had my daily cricket practice followed by Nukkad Practice from 09:00 PM to around 03:00 AM roughly. I was having real fun doing both the things simultaneously, but that made me miss my early morning classes (and sometimes dinner too) of MSE202, which is one of our toughest DC. My CPI was ready to take a blow and I ended up with an SPI of 6.8 in my 4thSemester. It was not just CPI that had fallen, my weight got down from 78 Kgs to just 65 Kgs during my first offline semester at IIT Kanpur.",
      "By now I knew that I had to give up some commitments, I became a CTM and enjoyed cricket a lot so had to suppress the desire of performing arts and with a heavy heart decided to not continue Dramatics anymore. The Club taught me the most though, be it punctuality, time-management and work ethics which helped me a lot in managing CS and Cricket together.",
      "I wanted to improve my academics without compromising both of my 3rdyear commitments at all. Plus, I never wanted to miss any of my classes & regretted a lot if it happened by chance. So, from my 5thsemester I decided that whatever be the scenario, I won‚Äôt be missing any of the classes. Also, during the academic hours, 09:00 AM to 05:00 PM, you are not bound by anyone, and no one will ever tell you to miss classes for any event/practice, at least from my experience in CS and Cricket.",
      "I did try the same and it helped me a lot during Mid-sems and End-sems. I did not just attend classes but also made notes & tried to get clear of the concepts taught, then & there itself. It was a bit difficult at times, especially during my 5thsemester but I tried. Finally ended up with an SPI of 8.0 and my CPI again reached 7.5.",
      "I followed the same strategy in my 6th& 7thsemester, but it was more robust this time and the courses too were of my interest, be it the 4 DEs in 6thor the 5 OEs in my 7thsemester respectively. Attending classes regularly and paying attention made my Mid-Sem and End-Sem Preparation much easier. It was mostly the night before and sometimes just a few hours before the exam that I started to study. It worked perfectly well again, and I ended up with very decent SPIs thereafter.",
      "So, the secret to time management is attending classes regularly and patiently listening to it too, I know your friends would be mad at you at times saying,‚ÄòFinal year mein class kon jata hai‚Äô, but if you don‚Äôt want to compromise on your commitments as well as academics, it is the best possible way.",
      "In the end I‚Äôd just like to say that don‚Äôt regret whatever you do in your entire campus life, everything happens for a reason, and it‚Äôll definitely make you learn and grow as a person in some way or the other. Explore whatever you‚Äôve thought of doing on campus and do it as soon as possible, these 4 years will go in a snap and in our case, it was just 2.5. Your wingies will always be there irrespective of the situation you‚Äôre in, so try to be there for them too whenever possible, you‚Äôll carry this special bond to places & for the longest of years.",
      "Many juniors ask that will this XYZ Club Secretary/Coordinator PoR help me in my internships/placements, which is quite natural. But please do remember that the only pre-req IITK asks/sets to be a member of any club is‚ÄòEnthusiasm‚Äôand the sole reason for that was the fact that people should come to clubs to explore their own interests in that respective field, to learn/know more about that, to interact with people with similar interests to widen their perspectives, to grow as an individual in multiple aspects and not to get an edge in Internships/Placements. It‚Äôs my humble request to all the juniors that don‚Äôt ever join a club/society/group for the sole reason that it‚Äôll help you in your career, join it because that particular area/topic excites you, you‚Äôre very much interested in it, you feel relaxed there, you feel a sense of accomplishment, you like the work there or you just enjoy the vibe of the people/place there. Please #SaveTheCulture.",
      "Also, do explore relationships if you ever get a chance to, I feel college life is the best time for it and there‚Äôll always be some selfish reasons to help/bond with you in your professional life to come. I personally wasn‚Äôt involved in any during my college years, but I did wish to at once, I had a crush since my 3rdsemester, glad I could stay loyal to her till the very end. I never confessed it to her (yet) but the way she handled me (& my weird efforts) and even reciprocated them was mesmerizing, probably the cutest girl I‚Äôve ever met.",
      "I‚Äôm always available on +91 9179234505, be it reviewing resumes, preparing for GDs, getting insights on MSE Courses & Professors, ranting something out or even just chatting, you can always ping me!",
      "Thank you so much if you made/read it till here, I am super happy & glad that I could keep you engaged till the very end. I didn‚Äôt want to compromise on what all I‚Äôd like to share, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt care about the number of words, sorry if it felt long. A very special thanks to Dhriti too, my AWL editor, for bearing me since 26th April‚Äô24, when I shared my first AWL draft to her, she‚Äôs been a constant support throughout, thanks Dhriti:) & sorry that I couldn‚Äôt cut down on the number of words:‚Äô(.",

      "In this 26th edition of As We Leave 2024, Parth Bhatt, a Y20 student in the Department of Civil Engineering, reflects on his time at IIT Kanpur. Parth‚Äôs narrative is a dramatic tale filled with late-night bullas, meaningful friendships, and significant achievements in dramatics.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Sitting alone, away from friends and college life, when I sit back and recollect the last 4 years of my life, I can‚Äôt help but notice a pattern, my filmy, quintessential Bollywood-ish brain analysing and equating these 4 years with all it once aspired to be in, a typical ‚ÄòYash Raj Films‚Äô productions, with ‚ÄòNukkads‚Äô and ‚ÄòBullas‚Äô; and ‚Äòlate night walks‚Äô and BTs‚Äô, and of course a big star cast, and a befitting ending, with a lot of drama.So ladies and gentlemen, or should I say, Aaiye Aaiye‚Ä¶Welcome to the grand spectacle of my college life‚Äîa dramatic extravaganza unfolding at IIT Kanpur. I‚Äôm Parth Bhatt, and this journey is a symphony of emotions, drama, romance, and triumph, with a touch of SRK magic.",
      "The camera pans over,",
      "Lights, check!",
      "Sound, check!",
      "Aaaaannnnndd, The scene is set‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for an online class!",
      "All thanks to COVID-19, the first three semesters at IITK were spent virtually, with Zoom lectures, online dramatics, and those legendary bulla sessions.",
      "The dramatic, extrovert kid in me survived late-night bulla sessions and random interactions. Being a mimicry artist and a drama enthusiast meant I spent most of my time doing online dramatics, a decision that proved right till the last day of college.",
      "I made friends, some that stayed till the end, some that didn‚Äôt.",
      "Became a Student Guide and guided my bacchas, but the takeaway was that my CPI was quite decent, close to 8, which could be somewhat attributed to them too! That gave me a license to goof around and interact freely with my batchmates and seniors, many of them guiding me.",
      "(Those crazy dumb-charades meets, Anjali, you were great competition)",
      "Fast forward to December 29, 2021‚Äîthe grand entrance onto the IIT Kanpur campus.Entering into a new world like Sushant in Chicchore (at least in my mind), with a background score soaring, I was ready to enter into actual college life with a bang! Perhaps not.",
      "Being from Ahmedabad, the Kanpur weather was very hard for me to accustom to, adding to the COVID restrictions imposed. But that still couldn‚Äôt stop me from the chilly¬† night-outs where I explored IIT Kanpur with my friends.",
      "The 4th semester was laden with a lot of action. Having explored online dramatics till now, I laid my feet on the first time in the dramatics foyer, a place both famous and infamous for a lot of sound and chaos in the night, where we sang, acted, and danced out hearts out in our street play, Koop Mandook! Probably none of us would ever forget that day!",
      "The inexperienced chaps we were at that time, we were blessed to be guided by a bunch of Y17 and Y18 seniors, Nipun, Rishabh, Piyush, Lokesh, Pulkit, Manan and many more!",
      "(Two of my most cherished photographs, the latter being my laptop wallpaper for 2 years)",
      "And, of course, a heartbreak‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what Bollywood stories are made of üôÇ",
      "But I had a very strong support system to help me land back on my feet and start running again, to my 3rd year!",
      "At IIT Kanpur, and probably at all the colleges, the 5th and 6th semesters are where dreams clash with reality. And in my case, this is where all the drama began, either way. I took charge as the coordinator of the dramatics club, a place that was my virtual home from the 1st semester to my entire universe coming into the 8th. The last 2 years of the pandemic had weakened the base of Fursat Mandli but only strengthened the mindset. The following 4-5 months were spent figuring out ways to manage and improve things and cover up the inexperience. Unlike most clubs, Fursat Mandli is and will always be blessed with a strong team, with most ex-secretaries staying strong with the club right through thick and thin. Going into Thomso, IIT R‚Äôs annual cultural festival, we were short on some days‚Äô preparation, eventually falling flat in stage play and street play preparations, and quite apparently, motivation collapsed. Despair and self-doubt sprang into my mind; I also had skin and back pain issues, and, like, after an aftermath with a villain, things looked like they were going nowhere. Academically and career-wise, I was stressed too, but I had learnt the art of time management, managing part-time internships, academics and dramatics, something which helped me a lot later.But every time, there‚Äôs a family to rescue; we endured this, leading the charge with performances. Not to forget, we had strong support from our seniors, Y19s, Lakshay, Ghanshyam, Yatharth and Devang, and very capable juniors, the Y21s.And our Alums, we did have a great experience and rapport with batches as senior as Y14 and Y15 to lay things back on track.",
      "Inter-IIT was a good notch up, and we were on a very improved track, if not for a last-moment drama over permissions and the hassles over the local train, which caused some major hiccups and much more than that!And that is when the real fun began!The real Avengers Assemble! Almost everyone I regard as my family, a part of me, was part of that squad, an invincible part! Cometh the FIFA of IITK‚Äôs Dramatics, Antaragni‚Äôs national level dramatics competitions, and boy, we were more than ready. The result was 3 podiums in 4 events; we were the title winners!I really enjoyed writing the songs for this one, bringing out the actual best out of me.",
      "(Memorable, post-performance moments)",
      "One piece of advice here to every junior: ‚Äúinvest in something that makes you leave your comfort zone, pushes you out of your rooms at midnight, and makes you great friends, a lot of learnings and memorable interactions.",
      "Could be a cell, club, team or anything; go out with all your heart and passion, create a lot of value and make every moment of your 4 years worthwhile.‚Äù",
      "And oh, I forgot, like every masala, and even a not-so-masala flick, there‚Äôs a lady charm.True for the analogy, but much more for that, in terms of screen time and impact, as I was blessed to have someone to pack a significant punch in my story and lead the whistles for me, someone I owe a significant part of ‚Äòspecial thanks‚Äô to!",
      "(Anushka, you were pivotal for me)",
      "Also, I was preparing for the MnC Council ‚ÄúInstitute Secretary, Performing Arts 23‚Äù position, where I couldn‚Äôt perform to the best of my potential and fell flat on my face, having a scoreline of 1-3-14, managing just 3 votes. Shockingly, and now amusingly, NOTA, with 14, was the winner, and that was where life went downhill. Self-doubt sprang again, and my confidence was reduced. Things looked dull, and motivation left the chat, but as I said, this story had a stellar cast to drive me out of trouble! The 3rd year had ended, and the story was getting serious by now!",
      "Post my 3rd year, I was left with a choice, to convert to a dual or go for placements.",
      "My branch of Civil Engineering and my lack of interest in it didn‚Äôt leave scope for the former, and here I was, giving tests and preparing pitch decks. I tried DSA twice in 2 years, practising day and night. While I was getting better, it didn‚Äôt appeal to me, and after long deliberations and discussions, I made the hard choice of letting go of SDE roles. Product Roles were a good match for my profile, interest and skill set, and now, it was just a matter of time before the real drill began. Having some great peeps with me to prepare and practice cases and give placement tests, stress divided, and the challenge seemed approachable.",
      "Self-doubt and overthinking threatened to derail my journey at every turn, however,being a big fan of hindi literature, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar‚ÄôsRashmirathihad a profound influence on me,",

      "By the end of day 1, I was done, though dusted, but the pressure made me realise the importance of helping my friends, and I decided to give up on relaxation and help my friends get through, something that gave me a lot of satisfaction and which I continue doing till date! It is these people who make you realise the purpose of life, and hence, they go from being friends to family to a part of you, a big part.",
      "(My core: Akshat, Shreyansh, Utkarsh, Rudraksh, Akhil, Shubham, Yuvraj, Sanskriti, Divyanshi, Vipul, Suyash, Anushka)",
      "Dramatics didn‚Äôt take a backseat, though, as this year‚Äôs Antaragni madness made me compromise with placements a bit and juggle dramatics with preparations. As the club was finally on a winning track, we tramped our way to the top again, this time too, with 3 podiums, 2 of them being golds.",
      "The next battle was Inter-IIT, where we bagged a bronze for our tally, and one more thing was ticked off my bucket list, an Inter-IIT Medal.",
      "The last semester was a whirlwind of fun and nostalgia, which is very tough to describe in words, something that is well enough to make a grown-up hostel-staying engineer cry. Bike rides, concerts, jamming sessions, endless matches of badminton and cricket.DE, crazyphoto shootsand the finaldram-eve. Something I am very proud of, being able to be a part of every street play during my stay @IITK.",

      "(The day etched close to my heart, bidding farewell to the club, and the sheer randomness with equally crazy juniors and colleagues, forging very friendly relationships )",
      "Leaving the place was much much harder than I imagined, as I learned that bidding farewell is as tough a thing as one could imagine. Emotions flowed hard while seeing people leave, and while leaving myself, watching the assembled showdown of friends made me realise the true essence of friends and friendship. Each one of them made me a much improved, mature and better person (hopefully) than what I was a degree back!",
      "And Fursat Mandli, my home, away from home, my identity, appears to be the ultimate void. This is when it hits me what they meant by being called a Fursatiya Forever,",
      "‚ÄúIf I were to choose my religion in my next birth, if any, it would be Fursat Mandli.‚Äù",
      "As I leave, IIT Kanpur seems like a dream‚Äîlike a real movie brought to life, one hell of an adventure. Not what I had exactly perceived it to be; more of the lines of an Anurag Kashyap directed flick than an Aditya Chopra musical, but more entertaining and rewarding, though. Made me a lot more mature and mentally tough than what I was before.",

      "Places you might have not seen me would be my room (cause I was always found in A101 in my 4th sem, B101 in my 3rd year and Hall 1 A-315 in the last year)",
      "As I begin writing this AWL, I might not delve into the sad parts of my college life but mostly focus on the ones I‚Äôll cherish for a lifetime üôÇ",
      "Leaving college is like stepping out of a bubble of memories. I still remember 7th November 2020, when I got into IIT Kanpur in the final round of JoSAA counseling. I was over the moon, binge-watching campus videos, and dreaming about campus life.",
      "The first year whizzed by with online bulla sessions, not-so-intensive election campaigns, and virtual hangouts. Then came the second year with a switch to MSE, meeting new folks, and those late-night Zoom calls that blurred into dawn. No matter how much we tried to make our long-distance college work out, deep down I wished every day for the college to open up.",
      "On 29th December 2021, we finally came to campus amid COVID times. A whole month of night-outs went into discovering new rooftops for bakchodi, finding new people, remembering the campus routes (my direction sense is fucked up), and another set of not-so-intensive election campaigns üôÇ Btw Sirothia won.",
      "Right after then real college-life began and that is what you‚Äôll find in this piece written by me. Enjoy your time reading üòõ",
      "At the end of the first year, our interviews began. The first interview I gave was for Student Guide, and I failed horribly. It was a humbling experience, but it taught me a crucial lesson:‚Äútalking to seniors before diving into interviews can make all the difference‚Äù.So after that, I gave interviews for Dance, Music, Dramatics, and Unmukt. I became secretary in all three except Drams (because I said I‚Äôd prefer dance over it :/). I later decided to part ways with the music club when I realized I couldn‚Äôt manage it all. Dance was and is the first thing that has always excited me, and seeing the dance club culture on campus, the little dancer in me was always overwhelmed. We used to have online dance workshops that we thought were intense‚Äîlittle did we know what awaited us. The real adventure began in March (when we finally came to campus) when we started preparing for Flashmob. I had the best time of my life dancing with the people here. However, my health took a toll from the rigorous physical activity and erratic sleep patterns, forcing me to step back from the Flashmob. After putting in so much effort, I felt like a loser for not performing, but yeah, I had to prioritize. Although I went to watch the performance and was happy to see my friends on stage.",
      "As more offline activities began, the more I started taking on my plate and started the hustle of college life ‚Äì collecting those third-year PORs and resume points.",
      "I wanted to become the dance club coordinator but realized it wasn‚Äôt in my cards due to health issues, so I started looking for other positions. I contested for president elections‚Äîlearned a lot and met seniors with a plethora of experience; however, I realized I hated politics :/",
      "Later, a friend of mine introduced me to the entrepreneurship cell, and what interested me the most was the Media and Publicity role as I have always been active on social media. I had given two interviews and finally got the position of Manager Media and Publicity at E-Cell.",
      "Gradually, things began falling into place, and I started to feel a sense of rightness. Plus, my health regained, so I joined the Dance Club again and performed at Thomso held at IIT Roorkee‚Äîa core memory!",
      "I didn‚Äôt do the Inter IIT cult meet as I had E-Summit coming along at the same time. So again, I had to prioritize. Conducting E-Summit was among the best experiences of my college life. I still remember back in December 2022, how we spent our whole day in the E-cell room filled with one two many DOAA canteen breaks. Last one week was us against the cold weather, it was funny how we all coughed in sync and then laughed about it. A whole month of rigorous preparations for those 2.5 days was all worth it. It was THE SUMMIT of our college time and I have learned tremendous things not just from the seniors, my core team but also the juniors, they were some of the few hardworking and good juniors I have met who were motivated & dedicated in their work.",
      "Right after that, I began preparing for my Udghosh interview and became the Head of Media and Publicity at Udghosh. However, this time it was easier coming from past experiences. But it was a challenging task to hold a POR along with the placement season. My seventh semester‚Äôs first half went into fest preparations due to which my placement prep suffered; however, I picked up on it in the latter half of the semester.I never imagined I would be able to conduct 2 major festivals in the same year but with the right people, right motivation everything is possible.",
      "The power that a walkie talkie and a metal id card hold. I knew there was a reason I took another POR even though it would be troublesome üôÇ",
      "2.Give different career options a try and choose what interests you the most. Don‚Äôt do anything just because everyone‚Äôs doing it or because it‚Äôs considered mainstream. Have your own version of everything.",
      "Just like I said, my college life is all about Trial and error. So similarly, my career decisions have switched from coding-> designing-> product. However I never doubted myself for wanting to explore various options, I took online courses and tried my hands at different domains. In the summers of 2022, I tried coding along with my friends but within a month realized my loss of interest in it.",
      "I didn‚Äôt take my intern season seriously because, at that time, I was interested in design and did courses in UI/UX and was considering opting for dual in MDes. So just to have a clear idea, I did a course in the Design department. Des603A was the most chill and fun course I have ever done. Made Cad models from scratch, saw real time 3D printing, visited ballpoint factories.",
      "However fun the course was, I could see that only some part of design excites me and not as a whole.",
      "It was only in the summer of 2023 when I learned about Product Management after talking to seniors. I joined a product bootcamp, read a few PM books and started solving cases, making decks and preparing for PM thoroughly. That is when I realized this is something that aligns with my interests and excites me to have innovative ideas and use my tech and design skills that I have gained in my 2nd and 3rd year altogether.",
      "However I didn‚Äôt have a single product shortlist from a week before placement days began, which made me reconsider my options. But then finally on Day 2 of placement season I got shortlisted in Pine labs ( which was 15 min before my interview). The 3 rounds of interview went smoothly and yes! there I had it. My dream role in one of the best product companies.",
      "This was me on the night of Day 2 preparing and smiling for yashanki:D",
      "",
      "Things I learned from Placement Sem:",
      "",
      "On a side note: My academic journey had stayed constant throughout the college life with a funny number of 6.9 CPI (which finally switched to above 7 in placement sem, Thank god)",
      "",
      "",
      "To all those people who said no one finds healthy female friendship in college: WHAT A LIE!",
      "",
      "Left to Right : Rishika, Yashanki, Rashmi, Me and Ananya.",
      "I have been procrastinating on an Upreti appreciation post for almost a year now, so here it is.",
      "Personally, throughout my college life I found it mentally exhausting to tackle multiple instances in a single day. When I think back to it, all I can remember is taking too much on my plate and then struggling with it. And then yapping about it during late night walks with my friends, or constant rr‚Äôs with Ananya and Yashanki.Apart from fucked up sleep schedule College had given me major core memories for lifetime- performing on stage for the first time with the dance club fam and winning 2nd runner up in Thomso; conducting E-Summit and Udghosh,the two massive events in the campus; Manali/ Banaras/ Goa trips with my friends; and the whole placement season was a rollercoaster ride.As my AWL comes to an end. Here are the ‚Äú13 reasons why‚Äù I survived college:",

      "In the 24th edition of As We Leave 2024, Akansha Singh, a Y20 student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, captures the essence of her journey at IIT Kanpur, cherishing the moments, friendships, and experiences that shaped her.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Time is sprawled all around us. Seven of us in a room giddily unpacking our friend‚Äôs recent adventure. Two besties admiring the most breathtaking sunset. Three of us having chai, analysing the smallest, strangest concept for absolutely no reason. Walking to Legendary at 4am. Two friends dancing in the gorgeous, gorgeous rain.",
      "Time doesn‚Äôt exist, and yet we have all of it. I have a faint awareness of things outside of this moment, but it feels like a distant, blurry haze. We are here, and we are whole, and right now is all there is. It is freeing to have time, and I doubt I‚Äôll ever have so much of it again.",
      "It blows my mind to think that it was just a bunch of small, insignificant events and a shit ton of luck that brought me here. A thousand little dominoes that fell in succession to create my life.",
      "Participating in the fresher‚Äôs debating tournament randomly. Creating a group chat with a girl we ‚Äúmet‚Äù recently. Being added to the SRDF(our first tournament) contingent. Getting randomly assigned roomies. A girl moving in with my roommate on a random summer day while I was at home. Deciding to try out consulting just because. Going to classes with my new roomie‚Äôs friend. Taking feminist theory because my friends insisted. Some nudges resulting in us breaking our tournament hiatus. Going to Delhi with the entire contingent.",
      "All of these decisions were taken without much thought, and yet they led to the most amazing outcomes. I had no idea, but so many little pieces were falling into place so I could meet all these beautiful people and have all these wonderful experiences. Surreal. In this very moment, there are people, places, and experiences whose destinies align with ours, who we are going to connect with in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine, and we have no idea.",
      "‚ÄúWe all know how loving ends. But I want to fall in love with the world anyway, to let it crack me open. I want to feel all there is to feel while I am here.‚Äù ‚Äì John Green, The Anthropocene reviewed.",
      "I am so full of love for this place and its people that I don‚Äôt know how I can ever express it fully. I have fallen in love with all of it, and that would be my advice to juniors: fall in love with this place, with its beauty, with existence.¬† Put your heart into people, clubs and courses. Romanticise everything: the trees, the peacocks, the chats, the late-night walks, the sunsets. Everything.",
      "I am in love with how alive the campus is. With little squirrels running around DOAA tables. With friend groups, couples, and readers scattered around the fountains, soaking up the winter sun. With gorgeous peacocks spotted randomly on the street. With flowers in every colour imaginable: purple, green, red, white, yellow and a hundred shades of pink. With dogs silently begging for pets. With the swarms of children flocking to campus school in the morning. With all the birds chirping and running around. With cycles that rush by, playing loud music and laughing uncontrollably.",
      "I am in love with friendship and community. These people have taught me love I didn‚Äôt even know existed. I‚Äôm in love with how they add colour to everything. With how full my heart feels every time I see them. With how intertwined our lives are: in our stories, in our politics, in our interests, in our emotions, in our entire selves. With how everything seems easy, achievable, and fun in the community. And this is my advice to bachis: please find yourself a community of women. They will show you care and joy and comfort like you‚Äôve never known. You will belong, and you will be free in ways you can‚Äôt imagine. You‚Äôll have space to talk about everything from sadness to sex to success. Build strong connections with other women; solidarity is liberation.",
      "I am in love with kindness. My mind is often a loud, painful mess, and giving or receiving kindness is a soft, sweet respite from all of it. There have been countless times when I suffered immensely, but friends, professors, workers, acquaintances and strangers have saved me with the smallest acts of kindness. They had no idea I was suffering; they were kind because they wanted to be because that‚Äôs who they were.",
      "I‚Äôm in love with how campus breaks dichotomies and gives you politics by just‚Ä¶existing. I used to struggle with the choice between living alone or with family. Families feel suffocating because of their lack of space, freedom, and the burden of unending chores on women. Living alone, on the other hand, is also awful because of loneliness and lack of support. The campus is the best of both worlds: you have community and support along with independence and space. You‚Äôre never lonely, and you also get to be your own person. It makes you wonder why the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt live like this; it is the most blissful living arrangement I can imagine.",
      "I am in love with hope. Hope that urges Suchitra and her simps to keep preserving and keep trying to make the world better even when they know how dire everything is. When they know how much power oppressive systems hold. When they will probably never get to see total liberation in their time here. Hope that has kept me going in the face of excruciating pain. Hope that I‚Äôve seen in my friends as they fight through recessions, heartbreaks and sickness.",
      "I‚Äôm in love with how mine this place feels. With walks to doaa at 4am. With how freely we dance in the middle of the street. With how every corner being just as mine as my room. With how comfortable every bus stop, every skywalk and every canteen is.",
      "I am in love with this place in ways I can never put into words. So yes, fall in love with this place. Lean into the moment. Soak it all in while you can. The grind can wait.",
      "Because, in the end, no amount of time will ever be enough. I will always yearn for one more cup of chai. One more hug. One more conversation about languages and art and history. One more sunrise post night out. One more time, listening to the mystery of love. One more minute in the campus rain. One more flower plucked and tucked behind our ears. One more trip. One more time, collapsing into laughter with all of them. One more winter morning. It will never be enough, but I am so grateful for all the time I did have.",
      "Thank you for everything. Thank you for love, joy, and hope. Until we meet again.",

      "In the 23rd edition of As We Leave 2024, Sanika Gumaste, a Y20 student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, reflects on her transformative journey at IIT Kanpur. Her narrative captures the essence of college life as a second home, filled with laughter, challenges, and unforgettable bonds.",

      "I write this as I hop on the flight back home. After many failed (and desperate) attempts to write my AWL, I realised I simply couldn‚Äôt put my emotions into words on campus. I guess I wasn‚Äôt ready to say goodbye to this place. This place. This place that had become my new home. As I took off, I remembered the words of comfort I offered to a friend earlier today. ‚ÄúAre tension mat le, ghar hi to jaana hai‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúGhar jaana nahi hai, ghar chhodke jaaraha hu‚Äù. Perhaps this is my last desperate attempt to hold on to my campus memories.",
      "I salute those who had the strength to endure these goodbyes. I salute those who showed their emotions and shed their tears. As for me- I will do that tonight. When I reach home.",
      "After 13 days of excruciating goodbyes, teary-eyed faces, and forced smiles for that last photo with that friend, I am simply happy I survived these final days on campus. I thought people were exaggerating when they said that college feels like a second home. I remember my mother consoling my anxious self when I left my ‚Äòhome‚Äô for the first time about three years ago- ‚ÄúAaj ghar chhodne ki vajah se ro rahi ho, kal ghar aane ki vajah se ro padogi‚Äù. Apt.",
      "To begin with, my memory sucks. I really, really wish I had written a diary. So, if at all I plan to impart any wisdom in this AWL- write a diary. You never know when you‚Äôll need it. Even if you don‚Äôt, well, it‚Äôs a good habit (so my father says).",
      "A few days ago, as I was packing up myhome, I found a few scribbled pages of an attempt at diary writing from my first year. I couldn‚Äôt even realise how much my life had changed in these last four years. The naivety, the expectations, the confidence. All of it. I can‚Äôt believe I actually made notes for PE101 and orientation sessions.",
      "I promised myself that I wouldn‚Äôt make this a cliche, but I came to Kanpur as a fragile, emotional and anxious kid, and I leave a strong, emotional and anxious adult. (Yep, still anxious, still emotional. But not fragile, and definitely not a kid.)",
      "How does one exactly structure an AWL? What do I write about? The first time I set foot on campus? Or the last time I leave campus as a college kid. Do I write about the clubs I joined? Or the acads that I screwed up? The first time I went to CCD. The last time I went to CCD. Checking my bank balance every time I went to CCD. Checking my attendance percentage to decide if I had to go out to a lecture in the scorching heat. My roommate‚Äôs loud alarm that never shut off on time. Those heart-healing conversations on the platform in front of L20. If only I could carry that place with me wherever I go.",
      "The first time I met my friends? The last time I met my friends. God, I really hope I don‚Äôt break down on this flight.",
      "I wish you were tiny. I would‚Äôve carried each and every one of you in my pocket.",
      "My life in Kanpur has been a roller coaster, to say the least. I think everyone‚Äôs life in Kanpur has been a roller coaster. Everyone, including me, came to IIT with wildly different expectations. Trust me, things turn out more interesting (if not better) than you expect them to be! A Y17 senior friend of mine suggested I join Vox just because I was fluent in English. It ended up being my core on campus. Who knows what fate has in store for us?",
      "One thing Vox has taught me- is that writing is hard. It has to come from within. Writing is an art. Writing an AWL is having a huge white canvas with 150 shades of paint by your side and trying to paint a portrait that art studios would label as ‚Äúlife‚Äù.",
      "I thought writing about myself would be easy, but hey, who am I kidding. I had almost decided not to write one. The very thought of having to recollect all my favourite memories and bid them goodbye, I couldn‚Äôt even bear the thought. And who needs another cliche, As We Leave? The ‚ÄúI came to Kanpur as a child, and I leave an adult‚Äù? And how do I cover four years of my life in an article? It seems impossible to collect all those memories, to remember all those experiences, and jot them down for someone else to relive. No way anyone can do justice to that. No way I could write a perfect AWL.",
      "But I realised that for the last four years, I have been convincing numerous seniors to write their AWL because it is their journey, their life, their story to tell. It didn‚Äôt matter if it was cliche. It was still their story. And thus, to dodge the hypocrisy, this is my final attempt at writing one. I hope that if not wise and relatable, you find it enjoyable. Tighten your seat belts!",
      "Someone asked me about my favourite memory of this institute a few days ago. I laughed it off. How can anyone have just one? To quote my amma-¬† ‚Äù Life consists of the little moments strung together.‚Äù. Perhaps it‚Äôs the first time I got molten butter in the mess after a crazy winter. Or the shallow beams of sunshine when everyone is out on the lawns, some studying, some chatting, some simply lying down, playing with the grass. I remember the first day I came back to campus. For context, I ran away home (literally) after ten days because of a funny friend named Omnicron. Everyone cursed the virus. I was secretly happy. IIT Kanpur was nothing like I imagined it to be. The shared washrooms, the people from diverse backgrounds, the mess food with the stupid frozen butter. Winters were my favourite, but this? This wasn‚Äôt winter. This was an exile in a huge refrigerator. I know. Sounds dramatic. But it was all a lot to take in. Come February, I came here again. ‚ÄúOne day at a time,‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get through this soon.‚Äù And I really did. I really did get through it soon. When I came back to campus that day, I was happy to meet my friends again. A little sad to leave the comfort of home. ‚ÄúHow many days will I last this time?‚Äù I asked myself. Two days later, a couple of my friends and I sat on the lawn in Hall 2. Nothing wild- just studying. And I‚Äôm not sure why, but all of a sudden, it felt like home. I felt comfortable. For the first time, it felt like I could breathe without worrying if I would be nauseous with worry. I think what I realised that day was- it‚Äôs not the place, it‚Äôs the people who turn this place into home.",
      "‚Ä¶And I‚Äôm leaving those people now.",
      "Home.",
      "A few of you who read this might know that I belong to a body called Vox. Yes, I belong. Everyone who knows me knows that Vox is my soulmate. It is perhaps the only thing that I gave my everything to. Vox taught me how insignificant we are in this system. Not just me but everyone. IIT is much more than students and faculty. And realising that was a humbling experience, to say the least. Yes. We are a part of it. But so are the mess workers. The hall sanitation workers. The staff. The dhobis. The shop workers. The cleaners. And that‚Äôs not even the entire list. Something I realised is that a lot of us undergraduates forget that we are not the centre of the institute. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not saying we are arrogant. We‚Äôre ignorant. I am more than grateful to Vox for making me realise that.",
      "Many people hate Vox. I can really understand why. We‚Äôre not perfect at journalism and additionally, journalism is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. In a way, I think this is the essence of how I became confident. You see, the fragile kid was terrible at saying no to people. She was terrible at fighting and confronting, at making her voice heard. The day I became a chief editor, my ex-chief editors made it a point to tell me that I didn‚Äôt have a spine, and I am so grateful for that. If you‚Äôre reading this, thank you. Because that was the day I learned the importance of voicing an opinion and fighting for it. I think that that is what made me a non-fragile, still emotional, non-kid.",
      "My literary family.",
      "Bidding goodbye to this place was tough. Every walk I have taken in these final days on campus reminds me of so much that has happened here. Those short runs to the SL canteen. Those long walks with headphones on, watching life go by. The days my friends whopped me at badminton. That day, I hopped on the metro for the first time to try the kachori at Rawatpur. Peddling crazy fast to a class because my life(0.2% of a course) depended on it. The night outs before an endsem, where we filled our brains with the equations and theories at the expense of our common senses. Or the idli and poha outside Old Shop afterwards that felt like a treat.",
      "Side note ‚Äì and I know you‚Äôre going to hate me for this ‚Äì try adding alittlesambhar to the poha. And thank me later.",
      "The days when we were so tired of mess food that we decided to cook our own food. Maggi, pasta, soups, coffee, and those iron-press grilled sandwiches. And the fight thereafter on who would clean the kettles. Cleaning my room spotlessly only to find it went back to the same state in 3 days. Scrolling through instagram with your friends instead of scrolling through it alone.",
      "The happiness you feel after buying 100/- books in fest stalls. Or the relief after having juice from the hall 4 stalls on scorching days. Or the days when the Hall 4 juice stalls were in front of Hall 3. Those little trips to E-shop to buy random things just for the sake of it. The opening of the Amul shop and the wave of elation after having two scoops of coffee ice cream. The bargaining with the electric appliances shop uncle before buying a heater.",
      "Setting up your room for the first time. The empty campus in the midsemester breaks. The nights when you vibed on dim lights and music for hours. The numerous trips to mama mio chaupaty to eat honey chilli potato, crispy corn and masala dosa. Seeing the corner restaurant beside E shop change its name ever so often. Fine Dine‚Äôs white sauce pasta, Hall 4‚Äôs coffee with ice cream, Hall 1‚Äôs boondi raita and Hall 6‚Äôs samosas.",
      "Making new friends. Realising my North Indian friends think Maharashtrians are South Indians. Telling my friends that I never had Rajma Chaval and seeing the looks of shock on their faces. Having Rajma Chaval for the first time. It was nice.",
      "The walks in the connector balcony in hall 6 that calmed me down. The insane political debates I had with my friends. Interacting with people from different backgrounds, from different families and different cultures. This is one of the most underrated gifts this institute has given me.",
      "Those friends who cried with you and those who laughed with you. Some betrayals, some heartbreaks, but the best of people to get through these times. It‚Äôs surprising how fast life changes. Even more surprising is how fast we adapt ourselves to this life.",
      "Ah. So many memories. So many lessons. And I‚Äôm already one and a half hours into the flight. One more to go.",
      "As I look back and think of all the happy moments on campus, I realise that in almost all these experiences with my friends, there was someone reluctant to join in. Be it Suraj or Lucknow, there was always someone (often me) who needed to be convinced to step out of the room and do something. I am so glad that my friends were there to knock sense into me every time I said no to a plan because those plans are some of the core memories that I will treasure forever. I guess it‚Äôs important to remember that with the passing years, it‚Äôs on us to make memories here.",
      "Life doesn‚Äôt just happen. You have to make it happen.",
      "Have fun. Go out. Fall down and get back up. Fall ill and get better. You can spend the day sleeping in your room, or you can spend the day doing something. Anything, really. It‚Äôs on you. If you prefer sleeping- go ahead. My advice ‚Äì don‚Äôt.",
      "Not everything is a lesson, though, Ryan. Sometimes, life just happens. Sometimes, you just fail.",
      "I was so immersed in clubs and cells and activities that come the final semester, where I only had one responsibility, and that too the juniors were more than happy to handle, I felt lost. I really did feel lost. What do I do with my time? Do I laze around because it‚Äôs the final semester? Or do I find another hustle? It took me a long time to realise that this thing that we keep hearing, the work-life balance, is actually important. As important as college academics are, as important as these clubs and cells are, finding yourself amidst this chaos of PoRs and grades is really important. It is very easy to get lost here. Most of us are school-district-state toppers. Coming here to find out that there are people better than you? More accomplished than you? More skilful than you? Tough. Really tough to digest. It can kick you, and it can kick you hard. Trust me, the minute you pick yourself up after being kicked in the shins- you make yourself a better person. I know it sounds preachy. But no matter what happens. Pick yourself up. The confidence it gives you is exhilarating.",
      "My first few days on campus were terrible. I was convinced that I would have to drop out. This unknown place with unknown people. For the first ten days, I rarely ate, I barely slept. My jaw was locked shut, fearing one wave of nausea after another. Studying my ass off for 18 years just to realise that I couldn‚Äôt cope with the slightest change in my life? I just lay in my room for most of the time, contemplating if this was the end of everything. I didn‚Äôt get any work done. And it was piling up at an insane speed. I remember that day when I lay down contemplating if this was what my life was going to look like, 16 hours of laying down just to muster enough energy for the rest of the 8 hours? And the next day, I went home.",
      "It was COVID, so no one really bothered to ask much about it. It took me a few days to realise what I was giving up on. Then, one fine morning, just like that, I decided I was not going to give up. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen anyway?",
      "The best thing about being at rock bottom is that there is no way out but up.",
      "It‚Äôs been a crazy journey since then. That journey from hating every minute of your life- to actually loving your life. No lecture can teach me what that part of my life did. We talk a lot about mental health, but they‚Äôre all just empty words. The real world is brutal. People will and do snipe at you when you‚Äôre at your weakest. You can choose to stay back and stay safe, or you can choose to jump right into the battle, fall on your knees, stumble, break a few bones, and then stand up. Trust me, nothing can give you that confidence, irrespective of whether you are able to stand up or not.",
      "My pillars in time of need. The best first friends I could ever ask for.",
      "Oh hey, we‚Äôre descending! Damn the turbulence. I guess now it‚Äôs really starting to hit that I‚Äôm going away from home. ‚ÄúHome‚Äù home. Forever. No more meetings at CCD. No more endsems! No more nightouts before the endsem. No more summer breaks. That one‚Äôs gonna hurt a bit. Who knows what we will have in the future? Who knows if we like the 9-5. If we like the routine. The discipline? Ah. Who knows. I guess we‚Äôll find out.",
      "I am going to miss this place. I am going to miss these people. I am going to miss randomly and unapologetically barging into my friends‚Äô rooms, waking everyone up 5 minutes before the mess closes. I am going to miss doing shady stuff withoutgetting judgmental looks. I‚Äôm going to miss telling lame jokes, getting exasperated looks, explaining the jokes, and getting even more exasperated expressions. I‚Äôm going to miss going to clubs and even more so- getting ready together before going to clubs, mixing and matching outfits and winging each others‚Äô eyeliners.",
      "My girl gang.",
      "These last four years, my entire life has revolved around some people who are now going to be miles apart. I know we‚Äôll stay in touch. We‚Äôll meet, we‚Äôll talk, we‚Äôll laugh, and we‚Äôll remember how we used to skiddle-skedaddle around. But that will be it. They will go their way, and I will go mine. Perhaps that is the reality of life.",
      "They say it only takes a wave to separate two logs in a river. I hope I can latch on to my logs for just some time longer. Because even though I met them less than half a decade ago, they‚Äôre MY logs. And I am not ready to lose them yet.",

      "Two days out from bidding adieu to my alma mater and the memories of my college life replay endlessly. As I sit down to pen this piece, a lump materializes in my throat ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt has all come to an end‚Äù my mind echoes. Following the classic VOX series has been a ritual for me, and now, finally taking the plunge into scribing my own edition feels surreal. This is the story of my journey at IIT Kanpur ‚Äì the ups, the downs, the decisions that changed its course. I‚Äôve tried to keep it light, simple, not preachy, and an unapologetically honest affair ‚Äì all Jabberwockied up. So, here I present to you my story of a place I called home for four years(or maybe less).",
      "11th October 2020 : When the JOSAA Counselling page displayed my college as IIT Kanpur, I did not know how to describe the feeling of, ‚ÄúIIT Me hogya‚Äù , finally.My parents‚Äô happiness knew no bounds that their daughter would just be two hours drive away from them(I live in Lucknow btw). I remember the first thing that I did after finally clicking on Accept was, seeing the video of IIT Kanpur on YouTube. It showcased the lush green campus and various red bricked buildings. It was a surreal feeling of anticipation and excitement of starting college at IIT, akin to the anticipation of a child eagerly awaiting a night of wondrous dreams.",
      "‚ÄúLittle did I know that the Sandman had a special invitation for me, one that would take me on a journey like no other, and on 18th November 2020, the DOSA‚Äôs mail came, of starting the semester in an ONLINE MODE.‚ÄùPS. I am really good with dates üòõ",
      "The college kickstarted with virtual meets and online orientations(seriously by then I had googled so much about IITK that the phrases ‚ÄúFill in the gaps‚Äù, ‚ÄúBring your pink Folders‚Äù felt like a cruel tease. To add to this every authority figure felt the need to repeatedly remind us, ‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôre conducting this online‚Äù as if we didn‚Äôt already have a complex of being- the lab rats in the great ‚Äòonline education‚Äô experiment. Sure, we were trendsetters, but not the kind you‚Äôd boast about on college memorabilia.With such an unexpected virtual start, I resigned myself to the fact that this online journey would trudge on for at least a couple of semesters. Despite all the efforts of counseling services, my amma, wing ammas and other clubs to make this transition to college life as smooth as possible and make it more inclusive, giving a good space to open up, It did not help me much obviously because chatting, zoom calls, initiating a conversation on WhatsApp was just not my thing. Sure, I was a social butterfly back in my school days, but this remote rendezvous felt like an alien concept. Trying to forge bonds with these strangers behind the screen triggered an involuntary force field. My self-preservational preconceived notions insisted: the less you let ‚Äôem in, the less they can hurt you. As a result, I decided to mind my own business and did not try to mingle at all (apart from my behens and amma). Well what would you expect, it was a drastic decision, I had no one to discuss my doubts with, couldn‚Äôt share what I felt that time, was too shy to ask for any help(read this as an inferiority complex, which was quite unusual for me in school but was new found ‚Äòthing‚Äô in college). While most of us had formed large groups and were enjoying streams and late night VCs, I used to stay awake with my fears of becoming non-existent in IITK along with my self-doubt of how well I‚Äôd fit in this place with this branch.‚ÄúIt felt like a disorienting fall down a rabbit hole of finding myself in a strange, virtual wonderland, where the rules of reality seemed to bend and twist.‚Äù",
      "My dad gifted me this book in grade 6, but I lost it. It wasn‚Äôt until my first semester that I stumbled upon it again and read it. That was the best feeling I remember from my first semester.",
      "After a serious academic hit in the first semester, I decided that this won‚Äôt work, I needed to spend time on my hobbies and my inclinations toward art. Connecting with new pals could wait ‚Äì I needed to rekindle my creative spark. Indulging in club escapades was the antidote to my isolation blues, so I chose Design and Animation. It felt like I was just ready to join any club because I was tired of my isolation.Time passed, from sleeping in the online lectures to missing morning classes due to my irregular sleep schedules, I was just becoming hopeless, knowing at the same time that this is exactly not what I wanted to be.But suddenly life took an unexpected turn on 2nd April 2021 , I received the reports of my parents and it stated ‚ÄúCOVID Positive‚Äù. I remember that afternoon very vividly. I would say no further of what followed, because that still gives me jitters. Academia took a backseat to the frontlines of caretaking. My laptop was almost shut down for two months. I had little support from my friends, But I was so lagging behind that nothing could help. I wrote makeup exams..had a lot of difficulty understanding concepts (Lesson #1: Don‚Äôt be shy of asking for help from your AMs, I realized that much later).By some miracle, I avoided the dreaded ‚ÄòF‚Äô but my grades weren‚Äôt cutting it for a ‚Äúglamourous branch transfer‚Äù and then I made one of the craziest decisions of whether or not to change my branch.For any sane soul stuck in the Chemistry realm(if you are not inclined towards research or doing masters), the knee-jerk instinct is to escape that branch‚Äôs shackles. I freely admit, that herd mentality almost ensnared me too. But since my na√Øve mind had been prepped to only deem a CSE swap as a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù game of departmental musical chairs, well‚Ä¶I stubbornly leaned into that binary blueprint.Call me a fool, but I‚Äôve always been an ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù type ‚Äì subscribing to that vintage ‚Äògo big or go home‚Äô mindset. If CSE wasn‚Äôt gonna be my ‚Äòpi√®ce de r√©sistance‚Äò, well then, I‚Äôd stick to my original Chemistryplatand make it work‚Ä¶or flunk out in a blaze of glory, trying.Since the start, I was bombarded with statements like ‚Äúlower branch‚Äú, ‚ÄúChemistry me placement is next to impossible‚Äù and stuff like that. So I made up my mind that ‚ÄúAgar placement hona hoga toh CHM se karayenge, otherwise I will prepare for UPSC‚Äù. Yes, that was impulsive but I stuck to it. (Reader‚Äôs Discretion Advised: This decision was far from the best I‚Äôve ever made. I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve regretted it. However, now that I stand on the other side of the fence, I see that it ultimately worked out for the best. But honestly, it could have gone disastrously wrong.)From the myriad club options, DNA, GameDev, SPO and my Techkriti crew became my new normal. These unveiled some amazing humans, reigniting my voice and self-expression. A shoutout to Panwl2 ‚Äì my first college group via Techkriti that reminded the semi-reclusive Shivangi still had life! I am thankful to one of my seniors for all that she helped me with in the start, but majorly for pairing me up with Harshit Raj(and from here you‚Äôll see this name quite often, interchangeably as best friend). In no other means, I would have thrown myself into this trap of being a co-team member of one of the most social people of the Y20 batch who was known by almost all. I had my apprehensions that working with him would be a daily torture for me because I thought I would think less of myself. But how wrong was I ??",

      "31st December 2021, I stepped into ‚ÄúMY COLLEGE‚Äù for the first time. I had good roommates and A-110 has seen some of my very first happy memories. Academically, I was gaining momentum but I was still having second thoughts about securing an Intern because (A) I had no clue of the profile I was interested in and (B) Do I really want to do this? A question that kept on bothering me.",
      "As an APC in SPO, I had the inside scoop on incoming companies and their cravings, but I knew my branch would pose serious hurdles. I continued prepping for internships, but during my first IITK summer, the realms of Data Science and ML caught my curiosity. I felt if I were to hustle, it‚Äôd be in this domain. My intern season, however, didn‚Äôt bear the expected fruit. Though happy to have assisted my peers as an APC, I felt hopeless about my own prospects. Post-August, I didn‚Äôt even attempt the process (Lesson #2: Persistence pays off. Many of my friends secured great internships by holding out a little longer, while I wasn‚Äôt even attempting the process). Deep down, I yearned to dive deeper into the ML world before jumping onto the UPSC bandwagon.",
      "Life raced by in a flurry of fests, exams, late-night chats with roommates, celebrations, aimless strolls, and colorful festivals. Those semesters were a balancing act ‚Äì juggling academics, extracurriculars, and friends. But I was dodging the big questions looming over me: ‚ÄúPlacements or UPSC?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo internship = no placement?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs UPSC even a safe backup plan?‚ÄùI was the master of asking questions but never answering them.",

      "Sixth semester and the start of the Seventh semester turned out to be the worst of my nightmares. Some major misunderstandingsresulted in the loss of a cherished bond I had nurtured since the first semester.I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to delve into the details, but these lines always remind me of that period:‚ÄúHow often we forget that,no matter how hard we try to fill each chapter with the right ink,once turning those pageswe all are villainsin someone‚Äôs story‚Ä¶.And that‚Äôs alright.‚ÄùThese two semesters formed my greatest internal challenges, which surprisingly centered not on academics or career, but on repairing my self-confidence after it had shattered into fragments. As the adage warns, when you‚Äôre down, everything around conspires to bury you deeper. I had locked myself up in my room for days, missing meals, I just did not feel like getting up from my bed, and as a result, my health deteriorated(both mentally and physically). The night when the doctor in HC wrote on my prescription ‚ÄúRefer to counseling service‚Äù, it was a wake-up call for me. (Eternally grateful to my best friend who never abandoned me despite my self-sabotaging efforts). I picked myself up, slowly but by that time it was almost mid-August and I had come to a point where I had no time to decide between placements or UPSC because undoubtedly it was going to be UPSC as I had not even started the placement preparations unlike most of my batchmates. But I was still not convinced at heart.Out of nowhere, a week before the resume submission I started preparing my resume too, with no particular thoughts in mind, I just began to formulate it in a way that highlighted my prime interests and works in the field of ML. Three days before the submission (read this again ;)) I called Harshit and said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go for a walk‚Äù. Little did he know the bombshell I was about to drop. That day I broke this news to him, ‚ÄúI want a shot at the big league(placements:)). I am preparing my resume.‚Äù¬† (The RM bus stand was the backdrop of this disclosure, I remember). For the first time ever, I‚Äôd uttered those words aloud. That was followed by a reality check and we talked about where I stood and how prepared I was to step into the arena.",
      "After that, I cleared my mind of all confusion and focussed only on placements(Again such impulsive decisions are not advisable), But that‚Äôs my story.The coming months were very stressful, past BT, uncertainties, no good background or preparation. But I had only one thing in mind, I have nothing to lose from this so why not give my best shot? It was during those times that I found an awesome group, ‚ÄúMy group‚Äù, we infamously call ourselves ‚ÄúBlah Blah‚Äù.",
      "Almost every Chemistry alum I knew had detoured into research, leaving me few relatable footprints to follow. Apart from my cross-branch Blah Blah buddies, I was largely flying solo.I took all the tests opened for my branch and performed well. The shortlists started coming out with me searching my name through all the lists. Even with the same number of correct questions, I was not getting shortlisted for the companies. That was a very heartbreaking moment.",
      "By November 30th, an almost unbelievable reality: I had accumulated a WHOPPING zero shortlist. I went to see one of my seniors whom I usually turn to when I am under such conditions, and I told him the scenario, He said, ‚ÄúYaar dekh, mushkil hai, I won‚Äôt lie.‚Äù A dagger to the heart. I cried a lot that night, not because I wasn‚Äôt prepared enough, but because I just needed a chance to prove myself.I table-flipped that negative energy, devoting my first three placement days to supporting my shortlisted friends. It was a difficult feeling. One by one they started getting placed. After they all got placed, I was ready to leave for home, with no regrets, because anyway UPSC was the end goal, but thought I might get a hang of the corporate too, maybe not my cup of tea. NICE TRY, I said to myself.But my crew wasn‚Äôt having my resignation. They scolded my surrender, issuing an ultimatum that I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to leave campus ‚Äôtil December 10th‚Ä¶a demand I only agreed to on one condition: My tests would be exclusively for the roles aligning with my interests and decent pay requirements. An odd stance perhaps, but my friends backed my conviction fiercer than my own.December 9th delivered my first shortlist‚Ä¶which rapidly transitioned into my first work offer as a Junior Data Scientist in that company! The role, the offer, everything was just according to my expectations. In a full-circle rematch, pride swelled my chest for the first time in ages. That RM Bus stand convo flashed before my eyes and as I looked at my side, I found my best friend there almost as emotional as me.I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd have crash-landed without this squad rallying around me. We have seen some of the toughest times of the campus and dealt with it together.",

      "Well after that time flew by. It was our last semester and I wanted to enjoy each and every second of it and I made sure I did. I had for quite a long time kept myself in my room, this was a golden time to experience the beauty of IITK and its people.(Climbing rooftops with friends was my favorite night time activity), I was finally open to new people and good talks. I am really grateful that I met some really cool people in my last semester(Casually mentioning Suchu Subgroup here :)).Last semester for me was completely dedicated to strengthening friendships, meeting new people, and exploring IITK. I also had a little mind boggling conversations on how long to be in corporate before resuming my UPSC prep again. I got my answers through intense discussions with friends and family. I felt settled and also wondered how that line of every senior in almost every AWL I had read ‚ÄúIn the end sab sort ho jaata hai‚Äù is so true.¬† Indeed, the trials and tribulations of college life had chiseled me into a well-groomed individual, ready to conquer the world or, at the very least, conquer my existential dread. In no measure, it could have been better. I ticked off all my bucket list of the last sem, and finally on May 10th, with a heavy heart and lots of good memories and laughs, I loaded my car with my luggage to finally bid goodbye to a place that would forever hold a piece of my heart.In retrospect, my final semester was a wild ride, a perfect culmination of my IITK journey ‚Äì a journey that had transformed me from a caterpillar to a butterfly, ready to spread my wings and soar into the greater unknown.And as I drove away, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder, ‚ÄúDid I leave a little piece of myself behind, or did IITK become a part of me?‚Äù",

      "My advice to my juniors or anybody who has reached till here(thanks, means a lot) is that ‚ÄúDo not blindly accept anyone‚Äôs word as gospel truth .‚Äù Evaluate their perspectives critically, and ultimately, forge your own path. This has been my only mantra since the beginning of this college because not everyone you meet has something positive to say about you and if by chance you give in to that nihilism, it‚Äôs over for you. Know yourself, know where you stand, and above all know your worth. Remember it‚Äôs your story, embrace your individuality.",

      "As I have finally sat down to write this after procrastinating over a month because I was on a rollercoaster ride of emotions of accepting the fact that now we are leaving campus and all of this is coming to an end. The end with the rant ‚Äúyaar yeh sab kab khatm hoga yaar‚Äù? and another month to accept that am I ready to bring up the emotional and vulnerable side of me in an article? Ig After 1365 episodes of overthinking and ranting about it to Yash and Ayush, I wrote one. Sorry in advance, for the long read it is going to be üôÇ",
      "Thank you, Yeva, for keeping up so much patience with me while I write this <3",
      "As I entered college, I was this excited girl wanting to learn and explore this new side of life ‚Äì it got more exciting because it was not just two years of prep but an extra six months of gap because of covid üôÅ",
      "Yes, even though it started online, I was happy at least my engineering started, which I had no hopes about then. I met Gaurav, Saksham, Sweta, Kshitiz, Alok, Yashvardhan, Bharat, and Naman online. I used to have a lot of¬† late-night group video calls with them. Even though I never met them offline, the bond was special and honest, even through the screens and calls.",
      "While during RC, some of my good friends came to campus ‚Äì they were exploring campus life with the friends they had here ‚Äì and we tend to lose that bond and touch. It was a bit sad, but it was fine as I still had my close friends stuck on video calls and texts like me. I explored being a part of different clubs and SPO more, which made me learn much more.",
      "It was all good and decent for the first two semesters. I had friends, and I had a decent SPI for both semesters. I had a way to escape apart from the struggle I had back at home for a few hours when I talked to people.",
      "Here comes the 3rd semester ‚Äì The family struggle increased, along with being told that all you bring to your parents is bad luck, and struggles started getting more to me, which by now was affecting my mental health a lot. I didn‚Äôt know how to handle the situation, which was so out of my hands, and I wished¬† to bring the struggle to an end and also if I could escape home. I ended up getting an F in ESO202 and a very poor SPI. Okay, so let me be honest, I could have handled it better ‚Äì we often think while going through it that it is never going to get better, though I was struggling a lot because of what was happening at home, but that didn‚Äôt mean ‚Äì I should have shifted my focus 0 to myself. It was not like my family was struggling financially or I did not have enough time to study- I could have tried more ‚Äì I could have still managed to get time out and not ignore my academics. Still, I did everything else apart from it, escaping from my current problem, which led to another future problem.",
      "When I look back at it, I understand by now, the problems in your life will never stop coming ‚Äì you will face a lot of them the first time ‚Äì so even though you are learning to deal with them the first time ‚Äì don‚Äôt let this healing or escaping phase affect the other aspects of your life.",
      "Cut short, we got the mail that we would soon be returning to campus, and I was very excited to meet my friends offline and stop this online struggle. Even though my fracture had just been cut 2 days before I came to campus, and my doctor strictly said ‚Äúno‚Äù¬† to walking a lot ‚Äì I had 15000 steps the very first day at campus! Sab ek din me jo dekhna tha.",
      "I was happy as the best of my 2 girlfriends were my roommates, and we all came offline. The harsh part here was we all were meeting new people. Even among our friendships, slowly, some people became closer to us ‚Äì the friendship dynamics changed a lot when we came offline ‚Äì in the process, all of us hurt each other a little bit ‚Äì because, at this time ‚Äì you are still that kid who expects from people and gets sad when it doesn‚Äôt get fulfilled.

      "The campus bubble has to break now, and here it starts. My best friend of 3 semesters and I ‚Äì because of too many expectations,confusion between us lost the beautiful friendship. Now that I look back, none of us was wrong. We tried our best to explain our sides, but maybe we couldn‚Äôt understand each other. Even though we both tried our best to save it, we had to grow out of it after a point. I wasn‚Äôt ready to face this or accept losing my best friend during the very first month. We had so many plans about what we would do offline on campus. But we learnt to let go of the bonds for the greater good of both sides.",
      "I saw people backstabbing, spreading rumors, and telling half-stories. Now, for a person who had thought it would get easier at campus ‚Äì the drama and unexpected events were happening here also ‚Äì it felt worse than back home ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt know at this point what to do. I thankfully had very, very close roommates who heard my never-ending rants,supported me and loved me during all this. That‚Äôs when I learned it is fine for people to spread things about you until your very close friends know the truth, and trust me, don‚Äôt try to clear it out, people out there don‚Äôt care ‚Äì they will discuss it for a few minutes and forget. The good part ‚Äì I did not fuck up my SPI a lot this time. I managed to do well in my end semesters.",
      "My tenure as CTM started around when I was finding an escape from the sad things ‚Äì so this is what I exactly did. I started spending my time at CS and working more and more there. I was passionate about working there ‚Äì and loved my work a lot. But the mistake I made here was somehow, because of overspending time and prioritizing CS ‚Äì I stopped spending time with my friends ‚Äì and whenever I did, I used to talk only about CS. I proved to be a bad friend there. The irony was, being a CTM,I was there for other people all the time, but maybe I was¬† not being a good friend to my friends when all they wanted was some good time together. As my room shifted( and that is how I met ashi), I tended to visit or meet them less. I never did this intentionally, of course ‚Äì but I guess I did take them for granted thinking that let me work, they are always¬† there.",
      "Please Don‚Äôt take people for granted while you are busy somewhere else exploring a new side of life, which sounds more exciting. And please Go up and talk to your friends if you feel they are doing something like this ‚Äì don‚Äôt just pretend their actions do not hurt you.",
      "The summer starts, me with my 6.7 CPI and an F to clear‚ÄìI needed to figure out what profile to prepare for ‚Äì what should I do? I knew SDE wasn‚Äôt for me. I did coding but never really enjoyed it even though I could. Apart from that, there was consulting ‚Äì which I won‚Äôt make it to because I don‚Äôt have the peaks.",
      "As I have seen lately at campus, there has been a shift towards consulting and product. Without even trying the other profiles dedicatedly, many people have just assumed that these are the only profiles that will suit them. Don‚Äôt do this. This is precisely when you need to explore the options and see up and be sure that you don‚Äôt want to do this before eliminating any option. At the same time, we have to be realistic about the number of companies for this profile. It is significantly less, and the internship period is just around 2 months, it is not like your final career choice; you can switch after that ‚Äì it is impractical if you just prefer a profile over the 2-month corporate experience you can get with this internship- which can help you know about what you want more.",
      "The one thing I fucked up and want you to know is: don‚Äôt be a shy, scared person at this time. You need to have the courage to talk to so many seniors / ask them all your doubts and for help. Trust me; they are ready to be there, and none of them will judge you. Don‚Äôt think like you are alone or anything, you will and can find a senior who has been through a similar situation and can help you out.",
      "Starting with the intern season, As expected, I had barely any shortlists. There were a lot of rejections because of the CPI. I did not get to the interview only because of that, but that makes sense because if the company had better options, why would they choose my resume? August was over. I had given only two interviews, and by now, I had lost hope of getting any internship. I was studying for it but had almost given up on it.",
      "Around August end we started the orientation preparations, and even though we had no orientation for ourselves, I guess that became our motivation to conduct a 10-day long orientation between the semester and near the end exams. The admin and even our coordinators were not very in favor of this extended orientation ‚Äì but all my team saw was a chance to revive the old culture of Y17 times because we knew if not this time ‚Äì next time it will fade more. Just a week before orientation, I had a shortlist, and I was near to not sitting for the interview because of orientation work. Thankfully, my friends forced me to go and give the interview. It went very well ‚Äì maybe because I had no hopes this time and was not at all scared. I got an internship, which was the most unexpected thing. I asked the APC twice if you were sure I got this. Even though my interviews did go so well, I couldn‚Äôt trust what was happening after the rejections. Maybe the unnecessary hopes and pressure would only make it more challenging.",
      "The 10 days of orientation was one of the best times I had on campus ‚Äì we worked endlessly, and none of us regretted it at all. Apart from that month-long planning and everything ‚Äì for 10 days, we used to wake up at 6 am to collect lines from HALL 4 and get free from Audi at 9 pm ‚Äì have dinner, and then meet at the CS office till 4 am. Many of us hardly even slept. Those hugs from parents and smiles of students is something¬† for which I am ready to do everything all over again.",
      "I had blisters on my feet that I was not able to even dance appropriately on the last day and was very near to black out on the 10th day. XD. but it was all worth it. When we stood up on the stage, we all started crying. We had made this happen just a week before endsems. And the last cheer ‚Äì ‚ÄúEk do ek do ‚Äì core team ko pyaar do.‚Äù This is my core memory from campus.",
      "But during these 10 days, a lot changed for me. During the orientation, I saw a side amongst the juniors during many events, that they tended to respect and listen to my fellow male CTM more.¬† Once in audi, while I was making an announcement ‚Äì someone passed a very cheap comment; I scolded the entire batch of 1200 there and then. Even though a coordinator brought it up, not very happy about it, and made me doubt if it was right to scold them- all I had as a response was that I wanted to show them the good side here, but as a senior and female, I would like them to know their lines, which should neither be crossed as human nor as a student here .When I was taking up a session that included a topic about gender equality and LGBTQ community ‚Äì there were a few juniors who stood up and stated very cleary that yes, females don‚Äôt deserve it. They are lesser; even in the other points, there were unnecessary questions to test my intellectuality as a female. I handled that on stage, with just the logical comebacks, but the moment I stepped out of that lecture hall, I burst out crying. I did not expect this to happen here on campus, that a junior who has just come to campus could do this. My whole childhood of being told I‚Äôm less because I‚Äôm a girl just came in front of me again. Yes, I had the option to ignore it, but I chose to answer it in a straight and strict way. If that day I had ignored it ‚Äì the only message I would have been passing to my female juniors would be to be ready to hear all this silently. In the first week, they would feel that the campus is the same as how the outer world treated most of them. Yes, I doubted myself a lot. Did I do the right thing? Did what I said,come across in a good way? ‚Äì I had no answers. While I was crying later at night again about all of that happening- one of the Hall 13 SGs video called me. To my surprise, on-call, his bacchas appreciated how I handled it well in the session, even after so many direct attacks. I felt relieved and had the biggest smile,I thought maybe I did the right thing.",
      "There were a few more incidents that did become a highlight back then ‚Äì that we had to go to hall 4 and talk to SGs separately about why none of them should be scared and raise their voice if something concerns them. For the first time now, I could see how, as a CTM, you could impact in a good way around",
      "But I have to say that I became a not-so-sweet CTM ‚Äì I used to scold SGs when they did not work ‚Äì the Y22s when I felt they were disrespecting their SGs or crossed their lines. I did become a bad cop ‚Äì which I don‚Äôt think is how CTMs are expected to be, right? A lot of juniors by then told me, ‚ÄúAapse dar lagta he‚Äù . earlier, I used to take it up as fun ‚Äì but slowly, it got up to me ‚Äì that shit I fucked up as a CTM. Are they scared of me? how are they ever going to approach me if they have a problem, which is the main part of my job?",
      "The self-doubt of not being a good ideal CTM kicked in very deeply.",
      "Alongside all this, I could not manage my academics, and the fact that ‚Äú intern Lag Gyi na?‚Äù ‚Äì I ended up with an E in ESO208 and a bad SPI. But I had 0 regrets by then ‚Äì I was happy that I worked so much, the little girl who could never take a stand back then that she isn‚Äôt less did take one here and found one of the places on campus which I was motivated towards, this time I did something that made me happy, which helped me to provide a helping hand to people around and whatever happened to my grades¬† this time was entirely because of me ‚Äì not some external drama or any other person ‚Äì I thought of it as a personal achievement XD.",
      "But along all of this, the escape I was finding from things happening back at home, those broken friendships, and that abrupt end to the relationship ‚Äì did not show up well ‚Äì I started having destructive panic attacks ‚Äì and crying for hours. Thankfully, after a month, I texted a counselor at 2 am that I did need a session. I ended up taking a few sessions, and it helped me get better. She helped me break my patterns. The number of panic attacks reduced over time. Please Stop ignoring your suffering, and don‚Äôt try to find an escape. It will only get worse. You cannot heal if you keep pretending you are not hurt, right?",
      "The people who I had not even known, whom I met here, we worked together, we fought, we argued, we laughed, and here they were now my best of friends, and the bond I would preserve permanently. I met the best seniors here and the people I looked up to, Namratesh, and Nandini. I ended up talking too much and saying everything straight to them, what I felt and how I felt, and there was so much comfort and a safe space where I never felt judged, and a senior I knew I could always come back to. I had learned a lot by then, being in CS ‚Äì I met so many people coming up and talking about their problems, I had personally handled what was going in different people‚Äôs lives, and the fact that I realized was that a lot of them had no one to share sensitive things with, it‚Äôs not like they din‚Äôt have friends but to have someone to understand them and their situation, not to show it small or irrelevant or joke about it. If you are reading this, please be that to someone ‚Äì you can never think of how much ease you will bring to their life and them.CS made me way more mature, and empathetic, and have a deep understanding of humans",
      "sixth semester ‚Äì",
      "It started off great ‚Äì I could manage to have more time with my friends ‚Äì I had those confrontations with a few of them after orientation ‚Äì and said sorry for the unavailability, Cleared the confusion we had- and accepted mistakes on my part. And we decided to work. personally, now it was going good finally ‚Äì my friendships were reviving, I was improving this time along with my academics, it was going good.",
      "Now, it has come time to apply for the post of Coordinator. There was no confusion in my mind ‚Äì I knew I wanted to go for it, and I knew the impact I could bring being in CS and having one more tenure there. I knew I had worked a lot and had been active the whole last tenure. Yes, I had doubts about being the best or ideal CTM. However, when I talked to Namratesh about the self-doubts I had, he gave me one of the best learning that ‚Äúnone of us is perfect ‚Äì but what matters is our intention and the amount of work we put in; if you were honest and intentions were pure ‚Äì you cannot go wrong‚Äù.",
      "My friends did not want me to go up for it because they felt more than I was motivated to work there, and i tended to lose focus on my personal life because of it, it was also a personal escape ‚Äì a few of my fellow CTM also warned that you need to learn to balance CS and your personal life.",
      "I knew all of this by now, but yet I was motivated to go¬† for it. But the one question I casually asked my then coordinators was if you don‚Äôt want to make me, and it is a clear no ‚Äì you can tell me honestly, I will back off, and it is okay. They said nothing like that has yet been decided ‚Äì and instead, there was a push from that side to fill up for it.",
      "Cut short way before my results, I got to know from one of my friends that they are not making me a coordinator (That sounds fine, right. They must have better candidates), but what I got to know was that to remove me ‚Äì there are going to be only 4 coordinators this time. I was shocked, cried, and asked myself if I was so bad. What was precisely so wrong that you had to cut down the number? there were no explanations. I learned about this before my handing-over ceremony, where I had to be awarded a CTM; what could have been worse? Do I even deserve that award now?",
      "None of my other fellow CTM knew all this was happening. I had to go up for the ceremony forcefully ‚Äì though I returned early to my room crying and slept ‚Äì not because I was rejected ‚Äì instead how I learned about all of this ‚Äì and how many other people on campus already knew about it with different versions ‚Äì it was no more an internal thing. I had already been accepted as an undeserving candidate ‚Äì so bad they had to reduce the number to 4. I did not doubt their decision, only me. even though I questioned what was wrong with me ‚Äì they had no answers to what went wrong.",
      "But this time, there was another round by the Head and counselors, and they wanted 5 coordinators ‚Äì so I was the 5th one ‚Äì even though I already knew what was happening. Moving forward, I woke up crying after sleep, and we received an email where I was among the new coordinators. it was not a happy moment but the saddest, the results were not the same for me- because all that happened made me think of myself as undeserving and the worst and not the chosen one ‚Äì I could not see the other 4 and me on the same line ‚Äì for me, they were better than me and me being the worst choice among them. None of my fellow coordinators or core team knew about anything that happened ‚Äì nor did I tell them. I kept doubting myself. I still had no explanation ‚Äì no sorry for the unfairness.",
      "This was when I learned what politics looks like, that every person who acts nice is not nice, and that there is a lot behind your back that you will never know. I learned that being nice and naive is not a proud thing, yes definitely don‚Äôt do wrong to others, but dare to stand up for yourself and guard yourself up.",
      "I had a great time at my internship ‚Äì I explored the field of business and realized this was something I was looking up to ‚Äì I knew what I wanted to do now ‚Äì I had a lot of my answers by then professionally, the answer of if not engineering then what. The little girl who came from a patriarchal house where she and her parents were told that you should not let her study and go out for college was doing an internship far from her home ‚Äì she sat on the flights for the first time, took 8 flights within 45 days compared to 0 in 20 years. The new city made me learn a lot, a lot about corporate and adulting. even though it did not go very well for the fact it was a group project and my partner was not interested in working. The mentor had no time to give for this project. Even though I worked very hard, it did not end as expected, and I felt how unlucky I could get.",
      "everywhere I work ‚Äì I put my heart out; no matter how much effort I put in, it¬† just doesn‚Äôt seem to work when the results come.",
      "The CS office was not the same for me ‚Äì after every meeting, I could see myself doubting that, yes, I wasn‚Äôt deserving ‚Äì the thought of not being the chosen one was not going to go that easily with the jokes and things I could hear from people around. Someone from outside would jokingly call me undeserving or not the chosen one. I had started doubting myself for having opinions and being straight with them. I thought that was the worst part about me. My few close friends ghosted me suddenly because of the new priorities they had. I did not get the PPO, I had an E of the orientation sem to clear, which, if not clear I am getting a degree extended as well then and definitely, the less CPI and fear that things will not even work for me in placements no matter how hard I try ‚Äì all kicked in at once. ‚Äì all I did was rot in my room alone for days, stop meeting anyone ‚Äì cry for hours ‚Äì eat maybe only once a day, and the only times I got up was because I had to go to the CS office ‚Äì and now that also was only a trigger- no more the escape I had. It was the worst phase, and by then, I had doubted everything.",
      "I was very scared; everything was not working in my favor, and I had this 6.7 CPI, but there was once someone who taught me that yes, things might not have worked in your favor even after the efforts you have put in. That doesn‚Äôt mean you assume the future will also not hold anything for you. life is about keeping going and never losing that little hope, and most important, is trusting in your abilities, you have less CPI, you have fucked up in a few places- and have not managed better earlier, but now is the time to manage. If you remain the same, you will let your failures affect other important parts of life; you will not grow up.",
      "That was when Nabh (Y18 and one of the best seniors I have met) told me you might not get so many tests and interviews to give ‚Äì but placement is not about the number of interviews but rather just doing well in that one chance you get ‚Äì and you have to prepare well now without giving up on yourself.",
      "I worked the hardest in my entire college life ‚Äì yes, I had my share of breakdowns and self-doubts, but this time, I did not let it affect my focus on placements. I accepted the CPI I had but promised I wouldn‚Äôt put in any less effort this time. I started staying with my friends- the ones who cared and loved me, yet in this vulnerable state ‚Äì accepting that it was good for me to let go off my then-best friends and not expect any explanation for what they did ‚Äì why they did. Ojsi, Kaustubh, Gaurav, Yash, Priya, Harsh, Kshitiz, and Ashi were my most significant support, and I have to say they are the best part of my college life. They made me realize what real friendships and showing up looked like. We did our placement preparations together, Harsh, even after the PPO did the product preparation with me because I needed a case partner. I broke my laptop 2 days before tests started and started crying badly ‚Äì and it took Kshitiz 2 seconds to give me his laptop. We were literal parents to each other ‚Äì supported when needed and scolded when required.",
      "Yes, because I had less CPI, I could not sit for many tests because of the cut-off, and even on the main day, I did not have a lot of shortlists. Yes, the other part of my resume was good, but the CPI, of course, overshadowed it. but once I got the tests in, I made it to the shortlist interview for a few, especially making it to the shortlist of GROWW boosted my confidence in my skills and abilities a lot.",
      "I had 2 interviews on day 1 ‚Äì I got rejected from one after 2 rounds and the other after the first round. I had one consulting firm on 2.1 for which I knew I was their top candidate, and the company already gave a soft offer after my buddy rounds ‚Äì my whole placement relied on it.",
      "I even got a call at 4 to be ready. Your name is there ‚Äì this is an excellent chance to go. You have prepared well, and they have already prioritized you. I went there at 4.30 am with the security that I‚Äôm getting placed on 2.1 ‚Äì I got to know the whole list had been changed ‚Äì and now I‚Äôm not even allowed to give the interview; they did not explain it to me, and did not communicate anything to me- The OPCs tried, but it didn‚Äôt happen. I had a breakdown ‚Äì and was very near to remembering how everything was unfair ‚Äì but for some reason, I did not. This time, I had the strength to face the rejection, not doubt myself, and take it personally with the hope that something would work out later or sooner, even though I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night and continuously shivered in fear.",
      "day 2.2, after sitting 9 hours for a chance for an interview, and after being told by the APC over a question very randomly, ‚Äúaapka baad me hi hoga, aap to company ki last priority ho‚Äù and when I had already told my mother that I would opt out after day 3 and go off campus, I got that 2nd last interview there, my that one chance and I got the offer. I even interrupted my interviewer, telling them the question had a loophole, and they corrected and changed it. I don‚Äôt know how I got that confidence ‚Äì maybe because of the TED talk by Prasang, very bad jokes from Kshitiz and my other friends I had outside to cheer me ‚Äì to tell me I could do it, and the trust I had this time over my abilities and all that I had faced during college. It felt like a stop to being told that I‚Äôm less, or the unlucky one, or the one who brings struggles to her parent‚Äôs lives. It was not a happy day ‚Äì because my best friend got rejected from the same firm, and many of us were unplaced.",
      "The next 3 days were the toughest for all of us ‚Äì the placement season was way harsher than we expected. It did not work well for everyone. I have never seen such desperation in the eyes of people here ‚Äì you could feel bad for those who were not even your friends.",
      "By day 5, my closest friends got placed, and after that, at the campus restaurant, it was our full, complete meal in 5 days. guess what? Even after placements, I scored a decent SPI too this semester üôÇ",
      "I had just returned from the best Goa trip with my closest friends. We were finally free from most of the work of our PORs, and placements were done. We all were hanging out more freely with so much time.",
      "I saw Shauryas putting so much effort into winning Galaxy, and trust me, the rally in front of Hall 3- Hall 5, and Hall 1 was my core memory. The talk of ‚Äújeetne de yaar ashi fir batayenge inhe‚Äù¬† has now turned to singing the hall anthem to the loudest of our voices and the slang in front of the other halls. From our first year, all we had heard were jokes, such as ‚ÄúGalaxy pata bhi he kya hoti he?‚Äù¬† ‚Äútumhara hall kuch karta bhi he ?‚Äù The fact is that Shauryas have risen more every year, and now they have comebacks every time someone says something against our hall. I witnessed very strong girls putting up with all the competition along with the misogyny they faced. Kudos to Ashi(The best president & pool captain this hall has witnessed), Sweta Shreya, Shruti, Sanskriti, Divyanshi, Sharvani, Komal, Anjali, and the rest of the senior batches who fought for it, and my juniors who worked for it. I loved the feminine energy of my hall and the happiest I am leaving seeing them winning ‚Äì it was the first, but we all know not the last, and there is way more¬† ahead.VEERA SADA TAYAAR HE <3",
      "I would just say to the girls in hall 6 ‚Äì I know you are busy with your lives, and there is a lot more, but if in any way you can¬† contribute to the hall ‚Äì just do it ‚Äì your lives should just never be only about yourself, when you leave, you can bring an impact, a change and make something easier for the junior batches.",
      "Even though I couldn‚Äôt accept myself as a chosen Coordie for the longest, my love for CS never reduced, because it was never a POR, but the place I looked up to, I felt I got¬† a place that made me responsible that I could help so many. I am happy as I got to meet the 20 CTMs, the people I have learned from and who were my reason in 4th year to ever show up for CS, I scolded them when needed, we laughed together, and with so many meets over time, they ended up being the closest set of juniors at the campus. The funny part is that I was hall 5 Coordie XD. Nevertheless, they will be the piece of my heart that stays on campus .But the few things I just accepted by the end of the tenure ‚Äì",
      "I met C4 wing in my 4th year, we had the best all-girls trip. C- mid-Hall 1 for being my favorite place ‚Äì that made me happiest and where we had the most fun, where we had all the parties, night-outs, the never-ending mean jokes on each other, we would gather up in one room, and talk, signed up on stake and what not- I met Akhil, marri ‚Äì my close friends first there and a lot of them ‚Äì who I did not know earlier ‚Äì kunal, bawri, Anurag, Saurabh, Anirudh, Nikhil. I had so much fun there with the people. C bot ‚Äì where there was Yash, Surya, Gaurav, TG, Devyanshu, and one never-ending joke to pull my leg. I reconnected with a few people, and it just got better. Never can I imagine that we all are going to cry this much when we leave üôÇ",
      "Apart from that, no, the suffering had not stopped ‚Äì I did lose one of my closest bonds on a very bad note, which I could never stop crying about almost every day ‚Äì but this time, I did not lock myself in a room, instead I came out and asked my friends for help. I showed up at every single thing that happened in the last month because this time, I knew this pain would pass, but the moments here would not come back; crying in the room is not solving anything for me. Please Stop suffering alone and ask for help from your friends. Nothing gets solved, but it all improves when they make the worst jokes. You are not alone with the people who love you. Thank you, Yash, Gaurav, and Marri, for answering my never-ending crying texts and calls and bearing it all with me.",
      "Though I have talked so much by now,",
      "but please never stop having fun and memories in these four years, do fun ‚Äì I will not talk about mine as I am yet to get my degree on convocation, be the sporting one to joke about your life happenings, do things apart from academics. Be out there, explore, and have those experiences. The mean jokes your friends will make about you are the funniest and just the facts (let‚Äôs accept it), there will be breakups in relationships and friendships, but don‚Äôt stop having either of them ‚Äì life goes on, with or without whoever and whatever. trust me, over time, you will find your people. The people who will stick and never turn their backs towards you. These stupid humans will make your life easier. the best thing I‚Äôm taking away from this campus is their friendship, and this part of my life will be the best and the most treasured <3",
      "There will always be struggles and problems; you will never figure it out all at once, but you need to learn how to get through it and never stop trying to figure it out. You will figure it out slowly but definitely. Move out from here with stories to tell, experience, and explore life, and learn from here before you enter the world outside. The things here really make you strong and a human ready to face it outside, you understand what you lagged, be it the good or bad ways, find yourself, and make your place here. yes, if you have made mistakes in the past that cannot be undone ‚Äì you still have your future where you can work! 8 semesters is a long time, my friend.",
      "And as they quote ‚Äì",
      "Your time on earth is limited. Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúage with grace‚Äù, age with mischief, audacity, and a good story to tell.",
      "Signing off with a lot of experience and all the grades from A to F on my degree (Don‚Äôt fall for this and study hard, get good grades).",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I am writing this AWL because I like to speak my heart out. Those who know me know I love talking and telling stories out of nowhere, and what could be a better platform to make yourself heard AS WE LEAVE.",
      "Reflecting on my college life at IIT Kanpur, I see how campus liveliness blends with the elegance of Euler‚Äôs identity¬†eiœÄ + 1 = 0. I first encountered this beautiful equation during JEE prep, marveling at how it unites ùëí, ùúã, ùëñ, 1, and 0. At IITK, amidst chaos and laughter, this equation symbolizes my journey, unlocking the universe‚Äôs mysteries and revealing the art of living within the madness. Let‚Äôs navigate this journey using these constants as our guide.",
      "Beginning of college life, Adaptability and Resilience",
      "On March 16, 2020, after my last Computer Science exam, my friends and I felt nostalgic, knowing we wouldn‚Äôt meet the same way again. As we headed home, we discussed the emerging COVID-19 outbreak, assuming it was like bird flu or dengue. We had yet to learn it would persist for years. Soon after, authorities delayed board exams, and we faced lockdowns, curfews, and global shutdowns. Without access to coaching, proper study setups, and financial worries, I, like many students, had to dig deep to pursue my dreams despite the unfavorable circumstances. During this period, we required resilience and determination to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic.",
      "Cheerful and talkative, I roamed around school corridors and classrooms with friends, doing pranks and getting pampered by teachers. My parents encouraged me to pursue my interests but always wanted me to appear for JEE. Their hope and motivation made me work tirelessly. Hurrah, it went as I hoped, dramatically changing my life.",
      "On November 18, 2020, from a freshman entering IITK virtually to May 8, 2024, leaving as a confident senior, my journey has been a life experiment where failures became ‚Äúplot twists.‚Äù Our IITK life begins through online platforms, away from the traditional physical campus: online freshers, events, bulla sessions, classes, and exams. We were confined to our homes for three semesters due to the COVID-19 outbreak. As a Company Coordinator with SPO, I gained insights into internships and placements. I also mentored with the Counselling Service and learning management challenges.",
      "On January 1, 2022, I finally visited the IITK campus as a second-year undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering. I received an E grade in EE210A during my fourth semester, facing an academic setback. The most painful part was not being able to repeat the course in the summer with my batchmates when grading was more lenient. Due to an internship, I planned to retake it in the sixth semester before placements. Moving from an E to a D+ was highly disheartening.",
      "Exploring new horizons, Nurturing Creativity and Imagination",
      "I was never a big fan of movies or web series. But when I landed at IITK, things changed. I started binge-watching films and shows my friends suggested. Music became my escape‚ÄîI loved singing my heart out. But, as my friends would tease me, ‚ÄúTujhe pata h tu bohot ganda gaati h‚Äù üòÇ. And well üôÇ, they weren‚Äôt wrong about that! üòÅ",
      "While capturing the beauty of IITK, I explored filmmaking, photography, and design, realizing my skills needed improvement. My friends Harsh, Kuldeep, and Ankit taught me the basics, helping me grow. Sure, I thought, ‚Äúediting mein dekh lenge üòÇ‚Äù‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt that simple. I also tried learning guitar, realizing it requires a lot of practice and time. Thanks to Ritick for guidance.",
      "The challenges and triumphs of internship and placement seasons taught me resilience. I‚Äôm grateful to those who guided me in coding tests and interviews, helping me prepare for future opportunities. This journey highlighted the beauty in every failure and the joy in overcoming challenges and creating lasting memories.",
      "I participated twice in cooking competitions organized by Meraki, the Culinary Arts Society at IITK. Cooking has been a cherished passion of mine for years. It was a delight to showcase my skills alongside friends, with enthusiastic participants eagerly anticipating our creations. The best part was the shared experience‚Äîwe cooked something special, and everyone ate together, savoring the moment.",
      "Janmashtami PerformanceOn September 7, 2023, my birthday coincided with Janmashtami, making my last birthday at IITK extraordinary. Determined to make it unforgettable, I stepped out of my comfort zone to perform on stage. Thanks to Aishwarya and Prachi and the support of my fantastic dance group led by Divyanshi with Nidhi, Tanishi, and others, I found the courage to go for it. Their belief and encouragement helped me rediscover my love for dancing. The successful performance filled me with newfound confidence and joy, creating cherished memories.",
      "Graduating GiantsOn 14-16 March 2024, I debuted in serious cricket at the Cricket Tournament by Chemineers, IITK. Despite my limited knowledge, playing alongside friends and teammates brought immense joy. I learned team strategies and improved my skills with their invaluable support.",
      "Dance Extravaganza with IBot++On April 15, 2024, it was a dance extravaganza. Until that day, the halls resounded with lively music as everyone rehearsed their dance moves, striving to deliver standout performances on the big day. From ‚ÄúChaiyya Chaiyya‚Äù to ‚ÄúBaby si‚Ä¶ south Delhi ki,‚Äù our girl‚Äôs gang nailed that day with utmost passion and dedication to ‚ÄúGirls Like to Swing.‚Äù Additionally, dedicated countless rehearsals tuned our muscle memories to dance to the beats of ‚ÄúTees Maar Khan‚Äù and ‚ÄúCriminal.‚Äù Even if my dance wasn‚Äôt flawless, the sense of achievement and the memories we created were incredibly rewarding. Our department farewell on April 14, 2024, was memorable, featuring a standout dance performance by the ‚ÄúBatti‚Äù girls, including myself, leaving a lasting impression.",
      "Academic Cycles and Celebrating Life‚Äôs MilestonesRecurring patterns of exams, breaks, and academic deadlines punctuate our college years. Just as œÄ never settles into predictability, my graduation was a journey of challenges and Growth, highlighting resilience and adaptability. Submitting assignments on deadlines, requesting a deadline extension, knocking next door late for lab report submissions, night outs to study for exams, etc., was routine.",
      "The fourth semester was a roller coaster indeed. Many online hackathons were held for female undergraduates, aiming at diversity hiring. I participated in many of them individually or in teams as required. It was the first time I met my online friends offline, and adjusting to the new environment and approaching people to seek guidance and help was difficult. On the way, I made new friends. On March 14, 2022,¬† I made it into ABInBev India, grabbing a six-month remote internship offer as a Data Analyst.",
      "I applied for several SIP internship opportunities, got shortlisted in a few, and eventually accepted a hardware intern position at Livguard-Wyncomm (SAR Group) for a two-and-a-half-month offline internship. Hereon starts my incredible Manesar journey, leading to bonding beyond campus. Gathering together, five of us, Kuldeep, Yash, Preet, and Siddharth, from totally different backgrounds, ended up diving into microcontrollers and batteries. None of us were jumping excitedly, but we figured we might as well give it a shot. Chatting became our favorite way to pass the time and get to know each other. Our daily routine was set in stone ‚Äì commuting to the office together, grabbing lunch, and exploring the city in our downtime. During this time, I immersed myself in programming and electrical engineering, learning new technologies and skills with my peers. Preparing for the internship drive was like a crash course in teamwork and problem-solving, helping me rapidly advance in understanding corporate life and my field of interest.",
      "",
      "Glimpses of Intern at ManesarThe experiences I received here in this internship were helpful. Little did I know that this intellectual internship, which I initially did not want but went for due to my parents insisting on it, would have something more in store for me and prove to be a savior for my placement season. My reluctance was because I wanted to try my hands on software development and data science/analyst fields. Like my other friends, I started preparing ardently for a good SDE role, doing DSA and a bit of CP to grab a good opportunity in the upcoming placement season. Placement season could have been better for the Y20 batch; we were somewhat aware of this crisis, and so was I. Realizing this, I started preparing well for the core electrical engineering opportunities and data science/analyst roles I had on my resume. With no shortlisting for day 1.1 to 5 interviews lined up for day 1.2, I grabbed an opportunity at Jaguar Land Rover the same day. This was like a dream come true for me, like many others. Thanks to my seniors and student guide, Shruti Nisal, for guiding me through this, and my Y20 placement buddies, who helped me and kept me motivated. Knowing very little about the future, I consider this placement opportunity a headstart to launch my career beyond IITK. Through it all, I learned that despite initial setbacks and unexpected outcomes, consistent hard work, self-belief, and timely pursuit of opportunities can miraculously align everything in ways you never imagined.",

      "I remember those dinners with Batti girls and some friends deciding not to discuss the exams anymore but examining every question we solved, getting ‚Äòn‚Äô types of answers by ‚Äòn‚Äô people still hoping to be correct. Telling Diksha, Barkha, Antara, and friends the night before to wake me up for exams tomorrow and take me along for classes with compulsory attendance and quizzes has been a routine these years. Those late-night talking sessions with my then roommates Anshika, Pratibha, Khushi, and Shruti have always been the best conversation night-outs, discussing all sorts of pan-IITK issues and people around creating and updating our databases for data analysis and conclusions üôÇ.",

      "Knocking at Rini‚Äôs room to accompany her for parties, walks, night outs, going to the Mess, or just for random talks, sharing all sorts of ‚ÄúBT‚Äù was a cherished routine, turning ordinary moments into treasured memories. Chatting about politics and elections with friends filled my mind with tons of cool IITK stories, fun senior tales, and interesting facts and figures. It was like a treasure trove of knowledge and memories! Asking people, ‚ÄúUp for a walk?‚Äù and ending up discussing cool programming stuff with Harsh, Harbeer, Kuldeep, Yash, and others. Talking about hockey and batti department with Satender, Kaushal, Mohan, and Ankit while randomly exploring new places in IITK with Rini, Saif, Ayush, Riya, Harshal, and others turned into spontaneous adventures that were both intellectually stimulating and delightfully unpredictable. Playing quizzes, UNO, poker, and card games in F-mid, H-9 with I-bot++ were some of my most cherished moments.",
      "On June 3, 2023, a bright summer morning, we set out on a 20 km cycling trip to the ISKCON temple. The ride was filled with endless chatter and fun. Arriving early, we waited for the temple to open, sitting on the ground, see-saw, and swings. This trip, like many others, was filled with joy, laughter, and the pleasure of togetherness.",

      "Trips to Lucknow, Banaras, Jaipur and MountainsExploring vibrant cities like Banaras, Lucknow, Jaipur, and Agra with friends during long weekends and breaks created unforgettable bonds filled with joy and adventure. One memorable trip to the mountains starting on March 25, 2024, with fourteen wonderfully weird friends forged memories and bonds that will last a lifetime. From feeling immense gratitude for Subodh and Priyanshu‚Äôs support as I climbed and descended the peaks to the frantic yet hilariously fun dash to catch our returning train, every moment was pure joy. The train ride was a rollercoaster of lively conversations and laughter, with Arpit and Ankit stealing the show with their impressive dumb charade performances. The endless teasing and joking added to the fun, making the journey memorable. Dhingra‚Äôs faith in my scooty driving skills on those winding mountain roads was motivating. At the same time, Abhinav and Ankit‚Äôs constant care for my well-being and Kuldeep and Aditya‚Äôs protective guidance near the waterfall added layers of connection and friendship. The cherry on top was the quest to find the perfect stone inside the waterfall, making this trip an incredible adventure. The mad dash for ‚ÄúBrownie Points‚Äù as we guessed the correct answers during the bus ride back to the station and the ‚ÄúGuess the Song‚Äù game with Subodh, Shruti, Smriti, and Ankit kept the fun alive. Going through all the trip photos and videos with Aarchie and deciding which ones to post on Instagram was a hilariously serious mission. Brimming with laughter, care, and companionship, this journey will forever be in my heart.",
      "And then came the most unexpected twist at the end of the tale: the remarkable ‚ÄúHall 1 ki Baraat‚Äù organized on 3-4 May 2024. Every moment was pure joy, from the thrilling elections to organizing the event, including shopping and decoration. We transformed it into a typical wedding with a unique IITK touch. It was my first time dancing in the baraat procession. Welcoming the baraatis at the Hall-6 entrance with Sumedha, Tulika, Prem, Vedant, Aishwarya, Ankit, Yudhveer and others was joyous. Brimming with memories, fun, laughter, and excitement, this day will forever remain etched in my heart.",

      "In the 19th edition of As We Leave 2024, Somya Gupta, a Y20 bachelor‚Äôs student in the Department of Mathematics, talks about her 4 years at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hello everyone, I‚Äôm Somya Gupta, another Y20 graduating soon, another Y20 with so much to say but not enough words to express it properly. I‚Äôm hoping that writing this ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù will make me feel more complete and give me the closure that my conscious brain dreads but needs. Being able to relive everything from my life at IITK and see how far I‚Äôve grown as a human being allows me to hold on to the moments and the purest joy I‚Äôve ever known for one more second and this brings a smile to my face. So yeah long story short, I‚Äôll talk about my life here, my experiences, anything and everything that I can think of and we‚Äôll see how difficult it is to finish this (I‚Äôm fine).",
      "I‚Äôll build my story around the people I met here and the beautiful friendships I made, because everything, every experience is incomplete without them. Throughout my time here, I met people from all across, some through my branch and courses, others through my IITK family(‚Äúbehene‚Äù), and others through pure social extrovert-ness. I would like to say that I was an introvert up until high school and I kind of thank the online semesters we had, where being social was the only way I felt I could survive. It led me to ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù so many amazing people. I hadn‚Äôt experienced anything so all-consuming before college, friendships that feel so right, they make you grin from ear to ear even when you‚Äôre just sitting there doing nothing, friendships that make you feel safe and supported every second of every day, friendships that make you wish an hour had more minutes, friendships that fill your heart with love, friendships that make you feel complete. One of the best feelings in the world will always be the group chat hanging out as if they had nothing else to do even with a thousand assignments pending and a series of exams coming up, laughing at each other, with each other, supporting each other often without words being spoken. Truly beautiful. I have tried (this is my 6th time writing this paragraph) but I can‚Äôt seem to include everyone that I‚Äôm grateful to (and not being able to convey the exact feelings I have is killing me) so I‚Äôll just stick to vague references and experiences that meant a lot to me and bring the biggest smile on my face when I think about them even today.",
      "The first year was completely online but still, we had the time of our life, endless group meets and making fun of everyone one by one, the non-stop teasing each other, the cute birthday celebrations, the election campaigning meets which led to no work and turned into timepaas sessions, the pre-math examrona dhona, listening to songs on discord while working together, especially the TA assignments, the lame jokes and me laughing uncontrollably at them, meeting offline for the first time(side track: it‚Äôs still pretty crazy for me to think that we made such good friends who still, to this day, mean so much to me, without actually ever meeting them or knowing them). I‚Äôll move to the second year before I get more sidetracked.",
      "The second year was even more unbelievable because I actually MET everyone and hung out with them DAILY. We had almost accepted that this day would not come anytime soon but there we were, sitting at OAT, just staring into the sky and the joy of being able to sit next to each other, not completely processed. In my second year, the best times are definitely the ones spent in Hall 4. The food was not the best, but being able to sit there and talk to my friends and eat with them made it better. The hall is beautiful, the most precious memories for me are when we used to go on a walk after every meal talking about everything going on with us. The random movie nights turning to late night deep convos and crying and laughing at the same time, the walking around the campus till 3 am in heavy fog and losing our way trying to find ‚Äúthe juice place‚Äù, the uncontrollable laughter when we lost our way trying to find Hall 6 and the SIS guard was confused, the looking at the stars and the rain with my closest friends, meeting new people and making new friends, exploring Kanpur(there‚Äôs not much but again, company matters), exploring campus from sunset to sunrise, the fests, successful night outs and finally finding more beauty and love in everything and everyone around me. Other than this, this year also allowed me to get even closer to my friends in my branch ‚Äì all the nights spent in the library where we studied for 2 hours and spent the rest at doaa canteen, the endless rants about the MTH courses, the last exams which led to hanging out at gupta juice. It was a cute set of people I have nothing but love and respect for.",
      "I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm already at the third year(funnily enough, also what I thought when I actually started my third year). This was probably the most exhilarating year for me. This was the year which felt the most complete, and fulfilling (and wholesome?). Female friendships are beautiful and I knew that already, but in this semester, the word ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù reinvented itself for me. This is probably the time for me to be more specific in my details now. One of my friends helped me when I was searching for a roommate. In my new roommate, I not only found a good friend, but also a sister. The similarities ‚Äì the vibes, the understanding, the way of dealing with problems, I lucked out. My best friend and I lived in the same wing and we had unknowingly created a whole family around us, my best friend, her friend, her roommate(s), the roommates‚Äô friend, my roommate and me. The 7 of us were turning closer day by day and it was a sight to see. It was really unexpected and probably that‚Äôs what made it even more special. I think that all of us had sort of given up on finding the kind of comfort that we found in each other‚Äôs friendship and for me, for all of us, it was and is ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù. We danced, and sang, we helped each other, we studied together, ate together, laughed together, cried together, went on trips together(mini ones), and danced some more. It was our own little family that we created, full of love and respect and admiration. But the third year had so many things apart from this newfound girls group. I got an amazing internship, which was so much more than what I could have asked for or hoped for. The team I got to work with was perfect, very wholesome set of people who knew how to maintain a balance between work and life and helped me realise what kind of a life I wanted when I do actually work as a full-time employee. I felt lucky everyday to be surrounded by a supportive team who knew life was meaningless without fun. Moreover, the 3 months spent in Bangalore turned into an experience of a lifetime not just because my closest friends were there in the same city and I could meet them every weekend, but also because the experiences I got to have with the other interns from IITK were incomparable to anything else ‚Äì n number of people randomly walking on the roads near our PG at midnight just to get fresh air, playing ‚ÄòSecret Hitler‚Äô every night till everyone got bored of the same people winning, walking back from the office in the rain, having the time of our life vibing to songs and dancing.",
      "This year, I also started focusing more on myself and my growth and I felt that I had a sense of maturity and wisdom (that, I think, comes to almost everyone in their third or final year), it was satisfying to think that this place not only gave me so much love and so many friends but also the time and energy to work on myself, improve my mistakes and be the kind of person I want to be. My heart is too full, so moving on. Basically, it was a good year overall, good learning, better vibes, best company. 10/10.",
      "Coming to the final year of study at IITK, this was/is a pretty crazy one. When me and my friends were just getting used to the stress that comes with the placement season, I got my PPO. I genuinely wanted it really badly, not just because the placement season was predicted to be bad but because even though I hadn‚Äôt dabbled into finance before, Goldman Sachs made me fall in love with the work there and made me want to explore the world the people there surround themselves with, talking about my work and my team there made my eyes light up and I wished that I could go back. Getting a PPO was a major stepping stone for the decision which followed. I had been wanting to do a semester exchange abroad since my second year but our template is pretty rigid and so after manipulating my template every semester, I finally had the space to do a sem-ex in my final semester. That was obviously a very tough decision because it would mean that I had less than 2 months to take in all the experiences and memories that I want at IITK and all this, while most of my friends were sitting for placements. After a lot of thought, I decided to do it. So there I was, not taking any moment for granted, trying to accept that l‚Äôll leave this place soon, trying to spend every waking moment walking around the campus with my friends, trying to complete things on my bucket list, trying to not be overwhelmed by the sadness behind everyone‚Äôs eyes masked by them trying to make the most of every minute spent together. It was really fun catching up with old friends and ofcourse saying goodbye to everyone who mattered to me at some point in IITK was hard, but the hardest goodbye was saying farewell to the campus itself. My last night on campus, I was walking around, trying to breathe in the smell of campus as much as I can, and my brain was not ready to accept that I‚Äôll leave and not come back to this place as a student anymore, that I won‚Äôt be able to call this place ‚Äúhome‚Äù anymore. Two months was not enough time to let that sink in(in all fairness, no amount of time could ever be enough).",
      "This semester, my last semester, I‚Äôm spending at Hong Kong Baptist University. This has been a whole different experience for me, the city is amazing, well-built, it has islands, beaches, mountains, everything that you would want to visit. I got to learn so much about different cultures, different beliefs, make friends with people from all over the world, it was a dream come true for me and I‚Äôm really happy that I took this decision(no regrets). I met amazing people here as well, they made exploring the city even more fun, it‚Äôs mind blowing to see people from such contrasting cultures come together and vibe, it‚Äôs wholesome to see everyone accept the other person and their wants. But of course, I miss IITK and my friends quite often, they are the cutest bunch of people that I feel so so grateful to have met. There is no feeling in the world quite like being able to exist in the same space as your loved ones. I miss them. I miss IIT Kanpur, I miss cycling around campus coming back from RM with music blowing up on the speaker, I miss celebrating birthdays at midnight on campus with everyone running around in the last 15 mins, I miss sitting near the fountain and watching sunsets after classes, I miss going on the terrace of every building that I could and watch stars trying to find the constellations, I miss dancing on the road next to Hall 4 not caring who‚Äôs watching us, I miss walking around campus till my feet hurt, I miss Mama Mio shakes and maggi during nightouts, I miss it all. IIT Kanpur has been the best part of my life yet, and as far as I can see, there is nothing that can beat the experiences I have had here. I will forever cherish them.",
      "Before I finish, I want to express how grateful I am to the friends who have stayed with me through everything, supported me and made me better in a thousand different ways, listened to me and valued my opinions. The best memories I have on campus are with those ‚Äúgoodest‚Äù friends who know me and understand me in a way that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ almost scary. The unreal butterflies everytime we meet, the infinite walks, the dancing on NCL terrace, the canteen food bitching, the movie nights always with Domino‚Äôs pizzas, the co-existing and getting lost in the deep conversations, the jokes and not being able to keep a secret from each other, the being there at every step of the way and changing each other for the better. Thank you so much. I am so so grateful.",
      "I wish I didn‚Äôt have to leave this place.",
      "There are so many things that I still haven‚Äôt talked about(everything surrounding the fests, the birthday celebrations and everyone making a big deal out of them just because they mean so much to me, all the cells and clubs I got to be a part of and so much more), but the summary is that IITK has given me(and all of us) a place to truly be ourselves and be loved and cared for. Everything we will experience in our lives moving forward will remind us of the smallest moments spent here that mean so much to us. I wish I could forever stay lost in the heaven that is IITK. Existing here has given us a joy that we didn‚Äôt know existed. This is a beautiful place filled with beautiful people and it has and will forever have my heart. I‚Äôm grateful that I got to be a part of the crowd here and that I got to experience this joy. Thank you IIT Kanpur.",

      "In the 19th edition of As We Leave 2024, Athak Kumar Singh, a Y22 M-Sc student in the Department of Mathematics, talks about his 2 years at IITK. His AWL is about the friends he made and the experiences he had at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Now that we leave this place forever, 2 years seem too short a time to gain meaningful experiences. But nevertheless, putting this feeling aside, I can say this place has taught me a lot about life, relations and interpersonal management. The memories made here will forever be cherished and they force me to feel pain in these last moments. One may call it the pain of separation from the people who made the stay memorable, the uncertainty of life that lies ahead, or the surety that I may never be able to live this kind of life again. Whatever one may call it, the feeling remains profound and contiguous.",
      "This was my 2ndcollege and certainly the better of the two (although Covid had a role in ruining my 1stcollege life). Being an MSc student here has been both ‚Äì an advantage and a downside. An advantage because you get the UG tag while having the privilege of being a PG student (although that has changed now) and a downside is that there are no sufficient senior-junior links and traditional batch activities. Maybe, the paucity of time we get to spend here is the reason. Whatever the downfalls are, they never hindered the formation of bonds in my life here.",
      "Starting from the first semester ‚Äì the time earmarked for exploration and mistakes (I certainly did a lot of them), Hall-5 accounted for most of my memories. Whatever time we could take out, we made sure that we hurt our bellies laughing. Who thought just lying down idle in a room with friends would constitute the most memorable of times? The room D-206 shall forever be witness to the most cranky and roasting individuals. My roomie and I spent our time together sharing anecdotes of our day and talking about lives in general at 2:00 AM in D-301. My routine consisted of waking up early for classes, skipping a few of them for my afternoon nap after lunch, attending the rest and coming back to the conundrum and fun till 2:00 AM. We sometimes went out for night strolls which always exceeded the limit we set in mind. I vividly remember strolling the campus during Udghosh ‚Äì just 2 of us and inquiring about every event that was happening. We finally decided to sit at OAT and watch the cool breeze go past our locks. We once booked a bus and made a Lucknow trip (It was a class trip and I managed to sneak in though I belonged to a different programme). One thing which stands out was becoming a ‚ÄòGovinda‚Äô in the matki-phod event during Janmashtami in hall-5. I could finally strike off one element from my bucket list after that. Those were some of the sweetest memories I had of 1stsemester.",
      "The next semester brought with it an air of freshness and excitement. We gradually started exploring Kanpur city and its places to visit. We went to the zoo in January 2023 and enjoyed our company more than the animals (I ain‚Äôt sure about the animals though!). This was a semester marked by my opening up to the most people in the campus. My friends and acquaintances grew in number. It was during this that I discovered my inclination towards badminton. I started visiting the old sports complex daily in the evening with my racquet and shuttle and sweating it out on the court. This was followed by a one Hour gym session in the morning. I enjoyed my heart out while I played. This continued till my racquet was broken.It was also the semester with both Antaragni and Techkriti and that meant no sleep at night for 2 weeks. The night strolls and canteen meet-ups were constant upshots of this semester. The long summer break was just unbearable after 4 interesting months of college but I nevertheless endured them, waiting for it to get over soon.",
      "Life in 2ndyear was greatly different from that in the 1st. The class was divided as everybody chose different electives and hence the sense of togetherness was weakened somewhat. Anyway, we managed to conduct freshers for our juniors and new bonds were thus forged. We were shifted to Hall-11, whose only upshot was the availability of single rooms. A small circle of close friends was created within the larger one during this semester with whom most of my time was spent. It was during this time that I learnt a lot about interpersonal relationships and that not everybody can be with you always. We would enjoy playing, talking nonsense, roaming in the campus, blaming the HEC for poor service quality and what not. I remember once we decided to go for a small stroll for half an hour after dinner. We left at 8:00 PM and didn‚Äôt return till 3:00 AM. It was my first time that I celebrated Diwali away from my home and it was a Diwali to remember. I got permanent people to spend my time with, discussing almost every topic we found interesting, even fighting in the process. Our interests and likings were not too similar but the curiosity made up for it. I thank all of them wholeheartedly. The most memorable time was a one-day Lucknow trip which the four of us managed to carry out without sleeping for 24 hours. The 3rdsemester included project work and was a painstaking one academically, but nevertheless it was completed satisfactorily.",
      "During the fourth semester, badminton re-entered my life. We got racquets arranged from the hall office and started playing in the hostel courts. We celebrated the new year 2024 by visiting Bithoor and ISCKON (We travelled on foot as there was an autorickshaw strike). The jolly talk with one auto during the night made our trip special. The Keechad-holi we played during this semester was worth remembering. Though the colours were available, all the people chose to get immersed in the mud instead. The 2 trips this semester made it worth remembering. We visited Banaras in March and were lost in its pristine spirituality. The ghats were so enchanting that none of us felt like leaving the city even for a moment. The Ganga Aarti during the night was a cherry on top. During the same month, we also went to Mathura and Vrindavan ‚Äì a 17-person trip which we ‚Äòjust‚Äô managed to pull off! The energy reverberating in the streets of Vrindavan was fascinating and though the trip was messy to execute, we enjoyed it a lot. Even the fest concerts at Pronite Ground felt different during this semester. The sight of Farhan Akhtar climbing the stage frame is still entrenched in my mind. Maybe it felt so special because it was the last time we were witnessing a concert as a student in IITK.",
      "It didn‚Äôt dawn on me that IITK was done for me until the end-sem exams were over. The day they got over ‚Äì 28thApril, felt very eerie. We knew we were done but no one wanted to realize that. The day it really hit me personally was the day of our farewell ‚Äì 3rdMay. After the event, the 5 of us (the inner circle) spent our night roaming the campus one last time, remembering good and bad days and reminiscing about the enjoyable moments. None of us slept even for a moment during the night. The next day, 2 of us left for home and 2 left the morning after that. It was while embracing my friends for the last time that the realization became unbearable. The sequence of people leaving continued until I myself left on 5thMay. The last moments were worth remembering as everybody I was friends with came to say a last goodbye. Although we promise to meet each other and stay connected, it is a reality that many of us may not be able to meet again in life due to the uncertainty that lies ahead. The last embraces made my stay at IITK even more special and now I eagerly wait for 29thJune to get into the campus again, dressed in white Kurta-Pyajama, receiving my degree, meeting my friends and sharing those laughs again which will stay fresh in my memory for lifetime‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",

      "In this edition of As We Leave 2024, Vijay Bharadwaj, a Y20 B-Tech student in the department of Mechanical Engineering, talks about his creative identity his journey as an IITK student and the vulnerability there in. His AWL explores his role in the campus cultural affairs, the significance of his friends in his journey and how transformative this journey has been for him. Read on for a wonderfully wholesome experience.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I have a problem with the idea of an ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù. As much as I can just ignore words and delve into yapping about how my college life was, I think some literary tomfoolery may help my case of a terrible attentional memory, which has basically made my academic journey since 2006 (when I joined pre-school) extremely drab-seeming in my own head.",
      "I think I don‚Äôt have a life interesting enough to tell y‚Äôall, simply because I don‚Äôt remember half of the stuff I used to find interesting, or just didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to what could‚Äôve been interesting.",
      "Hence, I‚Äôllzabardastisubvert. And find a way for myself to naturally remember stuff and weave it into a story that I hope y‚Äôall find‚Ä¶palatable.",
      "So, I have a problem with the idea of an ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù.",
      "Why? It‚Äôs very restrictive.",
      "How? It seems to me as if only thoughts that are shared ‚Äúas‚Äù the graduating batch graduates, matter.",
      "Only thoughts that are shared as ‚Äúwe‚Äù vacate, matter.",
      "That only thoughts that we invoke as we ‚Äúleave‚Äù, matter.",
      "This is a collection of short anecdotal chunks, which are all BUT my thoughts ‚Äúas‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äù ‚Äúleave‚Äù.",
      "As.‚ÄúWhile something else is happening.‚Äù",
      "While. Why just ‚Äúwhile‚Äù?",
      "I have been blessed to be a ‚Äòdecently‚Äô close part of IIT Kanpur‚Äôs cultural affairs. Not to be confused with the ‚Äúcampus culture‚Äù, but rather Media and Culture activities.",
      "I was good at what could be called a precursor to design. What kind? The drawing-and-sketching, ain‚Äôt-no-direction kind. Since high-school. I remember starving myself at home trying to attend a Zoom orientation about the Design and Animation Club.",
      "My journey to learning has been through a very freewheeling, self-exploratory route. I have played with things on my own, seized independence in creating fearlessly and attained pleasure in it ‚Äì which I still uphold as the best way to learn anything, even after 4 years ‚Äì be a kid about it. As James Victore says, in what is obsessively my favorite quote ever:",
      "The things that made you weird as a kid ‚Äì make you great today.",
      "This has forever been my guiding principle.",
      "I discovered something about campus club affairs the day I had my Design and Animation Club Coordinator Interview.",
      "The realisation ofcoordiinterviews being a stress test than a gauge of how well you can propagate and inspire told a lot about how clubs are designed to operate. Them being about how club seniors take pride in being intimidating, and how suddenly operating a club stops being about passion and turns into managerial business, is something I find ugly.",
      "I believe culture is not business. Sure ‚Äì to everyone who says you have to manage inventory, people, events, bills ‚Äì I agree. But if you tell an artist to not make a castle out of playing cards ‚Äúbecause‚Äù it‚Äôs fragile and can‚Äôt be transported to the exhibition, that‚Äôs some BS.",
      "And, this increasing emphasis to PoRs and getting white-collar opportunities by assigning tangible scores to being a Coordinator at X Club or Y Society enforces it further.",
      "For one, the exhibition comes second to the art. The exhibition enables the art, but doesn‚Äôt lead to it. The management should allow for creativity to show in a better way ‚Äì not suppress it. Deadlines. Monetary limits. Pressure to show and create. ‚ÄúYe kya hai?Why is it this way?‚Äù should not be hurdles to what the main purpose of a club (I believe) is ‚Äì fostering multidimensionality in an otherwise unidimensional set of what I call trade-school ‚Äúfactory products‚Äù ‚Äì as a senior often claims.",
      "You (the reader) mayagreeordisagree. I just seek from you tounderstand.",
      "I tried with THC to fix this (you may see a mention or two of it if you continue to read my ramblings), but I feel:",
      "Despite we leave, this mechanisation of club affairs may remain to be a sad reality.",
      "The paradox of departure is that I don‚Äôt think it is a singular event.",
      "I leftthe first timeI finished first year. It gave me a whiff of how college feels ‚Äì the (beautiful) fragility of social circles, confidence ‚Ä¶and the idea of merit.",
      "Being theacademictopper of my batch at school, it was hard for me to transition into cheating for academic credit. Trust me, I made notes for PE101. I learned. I am still bad at it, but I did just enough. Growing up with this fear of cheating on acads made me more self-reliant, albeit put me in unfavorable circles, as you could guess ‚Äì cheating circles were really instrumental in creating friendships in an online semester.",
      "I leftagainwhen I returned home for vacations after my first offline semester. It showed me the contrast of what the world was going to be, and how different it was from where I stayed for so many years. It was an unsettling revelation about life after graduation. Even if I juggle between home and campus ‚Äì what would I call home once I leave and pursue professional/further academic niceties?",
      "And so I have been leaving ever since ‚Äì when I left campus for doing my internship at Bengaluru, my last lab course, when I furnished no dues at Hall 1, when each of my wingies started vacating their Hall 1 rooms, when my parents landed in Kanpur to pick me up and a thousand times more before I stepped foot into my house. And at home, I still do occasionally, most recently during the Manchester Derby, that I could have watched at A-315 with my wingies.",
      "However, I‚Äôd like to tell everyone how I learnt that leaving is the best way to give validity to your experiences ‚Äì it only goes on to show how strong it actually made you, that you could imagine a life without it. Even if Caesar said that the valiant never taste of death but once, I believe no one is ever born valiant, and all of these deaths prepare you for your destiny.",
      "Before we leave, let‚Äôs all die a little.",
      "I have decided to write this section the way I should, because what I am about to say can‚Äôt stay unwritten, and reject my ideas of continuing this narrative the way I planned it to be, and instead, keeping important things towards the end.",
      "This graduation is going to end up in ‚Äúthem‚Äù leaving ‚Äì people. Not just people, but peoplewithme,ina space like the campus, where I get to livethe same freedom and intentionwith them. It‚Äôs the complete package that I am surrendering to the uncertain future.",
      "This is impartial gratitude to:",
      "Edit: I thought I did something with the wordplay, and then the thing with my placement offer happened. Welp.",
      "Should my memory fail and I overlook anyone, anticipate a message from me. I should stop, lest this keeps going on and on. üòÖ",
      "As they leave, I sense a void that may not truly exist, yet I will never feel whole again.",
      "I am certainly leaving differently. I had the fortune of establishing The Hip-Hop Collective at IIT Kanpur, with some of the best people I could do it with.",
      "I remember when I first met Shivang [Jaiswal]. It was in Hall 3, where we were all fresh from the smears of the lockdown and ignited by the camaraderie of the resource-constraint crowd on campus. I found in him, a space for unwinding about my somewhat repressed yearning for hip-hop music, and later, alternate expression on philosophy, humans, society and intoxicants.",
      "We stayed together in the summer, and created music. One of our first tracks was titled ‚ÄúWhy Are We Here‚Äù, we made it in a continuous session of around 24 hours, from a rough recording of a Music Club performance at CCD featuring Mayank [Mishra]. It was a newfound love of creation ‚Äì and it felt different to how I used to create music. A lot of my old stuff (which is onstreaming platforms) was execution-focused, even if it came at the expense of artistic satisfaction. This was solely for the love of creating new stuff and fiddling with it ‚Äì with no urgency for execution.",
      "The sample from the Music Club performance, chopped and composed for the final demo.",
      "Hence, things moved forward with this creative space flourishing.",
      "Shivang was associated with the Music Club, which he was seemingly growing out of, due to a clash of interests and a lack of palatability about a lot of ideas Shivang had. Naturally, as he was a producer, amongst singers and instrumentalists. The tumult started when Shivang, me and Mayank wanted to do a performance for the Freshers with Music Club, and there were contentions to how the club cannot represent ‚Äúrapping‚Äù to ‚Äúpre-recorded instrumentals‚Äù, or allowing non-members or people who say they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do auditions‚Äù for the club. It felt to me as if there was an air of perceived disinclination to hip-hop as music, and we were motivated to find ourselves stage time in the midst of this challenge.",
      "We did, and we came up with The Hip-Hop Collective. I believed that any culture (here, any entity under the Media and Cultural Council) should allow for counter-culture, otherwise it ends up being just coercion. We had simple ideals: create with no fear of execution and failure. Creating willfully, limitlessly and exploratively in a collective environment allows for a liberatory exchange of ideas and leads to wonderful learning and artistic output.",
      "This is exactly how we enabled around ten absolute newbie Y22s who hardly had the sonic aptitude to listen and stay on the beat, to pull off an amazing Freshers‚Äô performance and nail their bit bar-for-bar ‚Äì in just under four days. We saw our hypothesis on learning and propagating culture come true.",
      "But what about me? I found love for creation. I saw myself in the kids we learnt how to rap with. I put myself in a space where I could feel the urge to learn more and push myself with these kids, than focusing on delegating and ordering for stuff to happen.",
      "As I leave, I am glad to have originated a haven for hip-hop culture at IIT Kanpur. Despite not having anyone to look up to myself, I am proud to have partaken in creating something that now leaves the campus with more role models for future batches to admire and be inspired by.",
      "Leave.As we ‚Äúgo away‚Äù? Are we going away?",
      "One of my biggest insecurities I had the first two years here, was whether I had made the right choice coming to IIT Kanpur.",
      "I had the opportunity of studying Economics at St. Stephens, and I was actually looking forward to joining (even the first year course handouts had started hitting my email!). It was only the gnawing guilt of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt grind through two years of JEE prep for nothing‚Äù, that I had to surrender my admission there.",
      "This letter, as you may see below, gnawed me for two whole years. It kept me distant from the identity of an IITian, or being proud of it.",
      "IIT Kharagpur, because I had a few rounds of counseling to go.",
      "I was conflicted, because I didn‚Äôt know where my creative pursuits would stand in the hyper-competitive milieu of an IIT, but also didn‚Äôt know how a DU college would do justice to my academic excellence (so far then) and people who said ‚ÄúVenkat ji ka beta IIT jayega‚Äù.",
      "Some of my fears did come true coming to IIT ‚Äì unfair academic competition, a general automatism to resorting to the handful pre-set avenues for a job, and seeing it be reduced to an open reservoir of quests to collect resume points. I now believe it was my short-sightedness in associating such harsh thoughts with everyone who was doing so, but only if I could go back in time and fix my line of thought!",
      "Despite wanting to chase the so-called average IIT dream, I could not come to terms with it. I struggled, therefore. No branch change, no projects with professors, no fancy PoRs. I would frantically call up every senior I knew to tell them how I couldn‚Äôt figure out what to do in life. But it would never seem like I had enough time then to be able to tend to their suggestions.",
      "However, it was coming to me ‚Äì how doing nothing just because I don‚Äôt like anything a hundred percent ‚Äì was exactly the reason I felt the anxiety to even start. Shreya remembers me not even being serious about the internship drive, before something hit me that caused things to see an upward curve ‚Äì the Bain shortlist. I remember not having put in a lot of effort to make that resume (in contrast to today‚Äôs standards), but getting that shortlist gave me a nudge that maybe I was missing out on so much, just because I was not trying.",
      "For good or for bad, I started to forage my life journey and started stringing together a story that could explain the way things happened to me. It gave me perspective ‚Äì on how things were not so bad with IITK at all.",
      "My journey was defined not by conscious choices to have a journey, but by a clash of anxieties, aspirations and pure luck. Maybe, just maybe ‚Äì that‚Äôs what IITK was about ‚Äì it was a continuum of strong resolve on one hand, and equally, a beautiful and plastic fragility of keeping up with a standard of excellence we used to stand for, on the other.",
      "Things started looking brighter when I came out of my unidimensional view of IITK. I took initiative and carved a niche with THC. I combined my newfound potential in ‚Äòbusiness problem solving‚Äô and saw it in intersection with my creative pursuits ‚Äì to eventually get placed in a product role.",
      "(Edit, a week later: This aged like milk ‚Äì but we move. Still, I am in a product role ‚Äì just not ‚Äúplaced‚Äù in it. ü•≤)",
      "Even after I vacate the campus ‚Äì every interaction with an alumnus founder, every call with a junior asking me for advice, every workshop invite I receive, and every friend in town calling me by ‚ÄúAur bhyi, IIT!‚Äù makes me feel like I did justice to the ethos of IITK. It makes me own up everyday, come closer to this institute and be prouder and prouder of being a part of it.",
      "As we leave, and come closer to IITK every passing minute, we should realize that part of us will always roam these corridors, as it was never about finding our place in IITK ‚Äì it was about letting IITK find a place in us.",

From trials to triumphs, Pratibha‚Äôs story is a testament to embracing challenges, staying strong, and never giving up. She encourages us all with her message: If I can overcome, so can you. Remember to share your struggles and seek support from the right people.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "The small things we did in college now stand out as some of our best memories. I always dreamed of attending an IIT, though I never fully understood why. Now, it all makes so much sense. The year after admission was incredibly challenging for me in almost every aspect, or perhaps I simply wasn‚Äôt prepared. However, with time, everything fell into place. I‚Äôd like to share some incidents that are particularly close to my heart.",
      "When I was in 8th grade, I got an opportunity to visit IITK through some means I can‚Äôt remember, but I couldn‚Äôt go because of exams. By the way, I‚Äôm a native of Kanpur. I felt really bad about missing out, but I remember saying to mummy, ‚ÄúOne day, I‚Äôll get admission there and visit IIT‚Äù (yeah, I had some anger issues). Back then, I didn‚Äôt even know how to get there‚ÄîI was just really disappointed.",
      "I was fortunate to receive admission in 2020, but visiting the campus seemed out of reach for the foreseeable future. My friends from Kanpur and I were eagerly anticipating our first visit, so we made plans to go. However, the SIS guards turned us away, and we had to walk back, our excitement temporarily dashed. Then we made another plan, we were 5 and had 3 scooters. Rest of our friends were coming for some work so they already had an entry. One was mine but my parents had trust issues as once I broke my nose with it so my friend, Swayam, was driving for me.",
      "We found a way in through Chandeli Gate, but we didn‚Äôt expect to run into a SIS guard there. Just as we were wondering what to do, a car showed up and the main door opened. Without a second thought, we drove in right behind it, acting like we were with the car. And just like that, we were in the campus, ahead of everyone else from our batch. Then on our way, we passed by the TA202 lab, which was quite a coincidence because we had just finished our exam before visiting.",
      "We headed straight to OAT because everyone said it was the coolest spot. It was sprinkling that day, which made the weather perfect. We were wandering around the OAT, snapping pictures, and making a ton of noise. Suddenly, a SIS guard appeared and asked who we were, and we all froze. Then, everyone started giving different answers, making it even funnier. Finally, we showed our Pingala IDs to prove we were students and said the boys with us were our cousins. We ended up having a nice chat with the guard about the campus COVID-19 rules.",
      "Then we ran away, but in our hurry, we accidentally swapped scooters. Some of us decided to check out the halls while others headed to the P.K. Kelkar Library. I went to see the halls, and my friend Khushi took my scooter. Unfortunately, she got caught by the SIS guard again. They must have really liked her because they took her to the SIS office and had my scooter registered under her name.",
      "Khushi called us and told us to wait outside. She must have done a lot of RR¬† because they eventually let her go. We waited by the back gate, which was slightly open, and managed to drive out smoothly.",
      "So, on my first visit to IITK, I ended up lying to the SIS guards and accidentally getting my scooter registered under my friend‚Äôs name. From that point on, IITK has been a nonstop rollercoaster of thrills and misadventures. Who knew getting busted by campus security could be the start of such an exciting journey?",
      "I still can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre leaving‚ÄîCovid batch is leaving. I can still recall every single day spent on campus. When I joined IIT Kanpur, I was just a girl with a lot of dreams. But life doesn‚Äôt always go as planned. My college journey started with a series of unfortunate events.",
      "In December 2020, I lost my grandfather, one of the pillars of my life. My father fell into depression, and then my little brother had a terrible accident. To top it off, my father also had an accident. I got so involved with my family that I almost forgot that I have a college going on. These events broke me down and took a major year from me, pulling me away from academics. I felt hopeless, thinking I was falling behind and would never catch up. I stopped talking to everyone and almost gave up trying.",
      "But things changed when my friends came into my life. They started visiting my home to check on my brother and father. I remember feeling lighter when I shared my struggles with them. They stood by me through thick and thin. Slowly, I began to regain confidence, even though I felt like I was starting from scratch while everyone else was far ahead.",
      "By the time we physically reached campus, everyone was already preparing for internships. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to land an internship because I didn‚Äôt even know which role to target.",
      "One day, I went to Professor Dr. Rahul Mangal for some work, and while talking to him, I suddenly broke down. He was the first person who could relate to me. He shared his story and ended with, ‚ÄúTalk to people. You are the only one who can solve your problem.‚Äù Those words stuck with me, and I never looked back. I faced many more challenges, but I regained my confidence and knew it was better to take risks than to regret.",
      "I came out of that dark phase because I wanted to. I talked to people, I cried, I worked hard, but I never isolated myself again. By the end of my campus journey, I accomplished everything I set out to do. My friends were always there for me, and they are one of the best things that ever happened to me.",
      "IIT Kanpur made me stronger. The campus will test you, but you have to stay strong. It will bring out the best in you, but you can‚Äôt give up. Keep trying because if I can do it, anyone can. Just talk your problems out with the right person.",

      "Today, when I sat to write my AWL, I felt bad and good at the same time. Bad because I will miss my great friends, juniors, and professors. When searching for the photos for AWL, I felt nostalgic about every photo crossing my eye. Good because some new challenges are waiting in life. Let‚Äôs deal with them as early as we can. If one or another day has to come, then why not today?",
      "Many changes have happened in the last five years (3.5 only; 1.5 years were COVID) in college, and I am considering where to start the story and where to end. I can‚Äôt cover everything, but I will try to cover most things more concisely so that AWL doesn‚Äôt become a course book. Let‚Äôs begin. I hope you will enjoy and get something from this AWL.",
      "We need someone to support us every time in our lives. From the first day of college, we had our SG (student guide); from the first day on, we started building conversations in our wing, and some days we had a perfect wing group. My wing group was amazing.",
      "One day, around 12:30 AM, I was sleeping, and Arush (my roommate) came, and he was like, ‚ÄúSomething happened; come fast outside.‚Äù Meanwhile, almost all the wingies were sitting in the Sahil room, and Arush called me there. Everyone was like,‚ÄúNitish dance kar.‚ÄùI was like,‚ÄúKya Yarr.‚Äù",
      "These small things are excellent and irritate you when they happen, but you will miss those moments when they are not with you. We used to go to dinner frequently and had a game plan for every meal. Everyone has to tell a story about their childhood, and that part is just amazing. During our final year of B.Tech, we gathered in our wing F-Bot daily and had a great time there.",
      "Along with my wingies, PIL Lab, where I lived most of the time in the final year of my dual degree, I interacted well with everyone. One of the best things we used to do was go to the canteen for tea every day with the lab members. We used to have interesting discussions there. We went to dinner together multiple times. The best was when the whole lab group went to a placement party; it was unique and memorable. Some of the lab members are very good friends. We also danced together in DE (Dance Extravaganza); that was my first dance.",
      "In our lives, we should always be around something that inspires us to be active in society and be aware of society so that we don‚Äôt forget our role. Our Milan and Vivekananda Samiti teams were amazing.",
      "We used to have daily games and discussions on topics focused on our own and society‚Äôs development. We went on multiple trips near Kanpur. The people are one of my favorite people, and I used to discuss topics that interest me, like what society needs and what we can do for society. You should always be in touch with the people and group, or create some group like this other than your wing and lab.",
      "When we joined the IITK on our first day, we were motivated to study hard, do something big like everyone else, and contribute to society. Still, as time passed, we used to engage in college life, and we just forgot about where we came from and what responsibilities we had. We forgot to plan for society and started living in our own world like frogs in a well. The same thing happened to me until my second semester. However, a turning point occurred when I had a conversation with one of our alums. So, I decided to do something for society while living in college.",
      "We don‚Äôt have much time besides club activities and academics, so I decided to continue with the Vivekananda Samiti. I am very grateful that I got the chance to meet many social workers, spiritual leaders, alums, and monks there. During my Vivekananda Samiti tenure, I taught students, distributed blank, and met people outside campus. During our campus life, we get involved in our problems too much and think our problems are the biggest. Still, when you go outside and see the people and meet them, you will realize that our problem is tiny compared to theirs, and from there, you will also get the motivation to work properly and patiently.",
      "Due to a lack of time on our campus, we can‚Äôt do too much work, but at least we can get exposure to what‚Äôs going on in society, and to get exposure, the best way is to visit the places where people are working full time for society. We did two visits, one at Sonbhadra, UP, where we got a chance to meet the tribal (Vanvasi) students from all over India. The best moment was when I was in Sonbhadra on December 31, 2022, and I danced with them for 2 hours on New Year‚Äôs Eve. It was one of the best moments of my life.",
      "We also went to Jhabua MP, where the Shivganga team worked for society. There, I saw the tribal people and lived for one night at one of the tribe‚Äôs (Dhuliya Bhai) homes. After seeing the welcoming nature of the people and the culture they are preserving, I was shocked. If they can maintain the culture and humanity between them, then why can‚Äôt we? I can‚Äôt write every moment of that place; otherwise, AWL will become very long.",
      "We did other small things also other than trips, like teaching students and meeting some personalities who work for the society, but I can‚Äôt write about everything here:)",
      "When I was in Patna during my 12th coaching, I sometimes went to Premchand Rangshala Patna, where people were trying to make the society aware via Nukkar Natak (Street Play), so while filling out the form for freshmen night, I decided to fill out the form for the dram‚Äôs club. I had a great time with the dram‚Äôs club team. It was the last day of Antaragni 2019, and we won the 2nd Prize in Mime and the First Prize in Nukkar. For the Bollywood Pronight, Shankar Mahadevan came to campus, and our whole dramatics club team was in slippers and dancing on the ground. And while dancing, my slipper was also broken. Indeed,¬† that day was one of the best days on campus.",
      "Along with the Dramatics Club, I was also in E-cell during E-Summit. The fun thing in the E-cell interview was the manager asking the spelling of entrepreneurship to select the volunteer. As a manager at Techkriti 22, I had an excellent experience managing multiple things in the core team, and the sham with Shan was just amazing.",
      "Once lockdown started, I decided to leave both clubs. At one point, while I was in the volunteer group Vivekananda Samiti, a member messaged me a link to an article by Swami Vivekananda. Still, it was not opening due to a technical issue. After that, I messaged him for the pdf, and after some time, we had a long discussion about society and many other things. That day, I joined Vivekananda Samiti as a secretary and then manager. Vivekananda Samit is a social volunteering club where we can meet many good people. We learned a lot there with the Samiti team and Swami Atmashradhannada Ji Maharaj, the secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Kanpur and an advisor for Vivekananda Samiti. The lessons and experiences I gained with the Vivekananda Samiti will remain with me for life.",
      "On the first day of college, I still remember being one of the guys in my wing with the least understanding of English. During orientation, everyone had to write the English test, which was very easy, but I failed in that, and I had to do ENG122C (English Language and Communication Skills) as HSS in my first semester.",
      "One thing I remember during the LIF101 course is that when the professor was teaching, I was not getting many words in the class, and I used to write the word that I was not getting, and then after coming to the room, take a look at those words for their meaning. I managed, and after the first semester, I got things right with some effort.",
      "Unfortunately, our second-semester midterm (Holi‚Äô20) vacation was 1.5 years long. Many ups and downs were there. Let‚Äôs keep it aside; let‚Äôs not be sad again and return to college. I came to college during RC (Resource Constrained: If someone has an issue with online resources) time. That time was significant in Hall 13 because, whoever we were, we were talking to everyone and knowing each other. One day after the end semester exam of one of the courses, 6-7 people just came out of the room, and whoever was meeting, even if we didn‚Äôt know him, we just took their GPL, and after GPL, they were also joining the team. That was a lot of fun.",
      "During the SPO internship session, I didn‚Äôt get the internship. Still, at the end of February 2022, I got the summer internship at L&T Technology Services, with the help of one of the old alums via LinkedIn (I am not going to explain here how to get an internship and a job using LinkedIn). I also got the PPO after that internship, but I decided to do a dual degree, and finally, I enjoyed an extra year on campus. I got a very good PIL (Perception and Intelligence) Lab environment from my thesis advisor, Prof. Tushar Sandhan. During this placement season, I got an offer from TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and will join them.",
      "I will keep some things open for you, and if you need some discussion or help, please contact me. Now, I will try to summarize some of my learning and things that I would like everyone to take care of while in college:",
      "Thanks for reading till the end!!!",
      "If you have any queries or want to discuss something, message me onLinkedIn.",
      "Ultimately, I thank everyone who helped make college life memorable. I hope to meet you guys soon.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",

      "The 13th edition of As We Leave 2024features Parikshit Tomer, a graduating Y20 student from the department of Chemical Engineering. He covers almost everything about his experience here at IITK ranging from the online to offline shift and how he dealt with the change. Read on to have a good laugh and maybe learn some valuable life lessons at the same time.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It is said that some of all wisdom lies in JEE prep. Well, then the person who said this wouldn‚Äôt have had the gratifying experience of being at IITK because all of some wisdom garnered during JEE is flushed down the commode at the unisex bathrooms in RM as you are asked to ‚Äòkhol ke bta‚Äô at 3 in the night.",
      "I was very confused as to how to start this AWL. So I decided to do away with the toilet humour in the beginning so that I could talk about my experiences undisturbed by the undeniable urge to talk about a top 3 list of best washrooms on campus.",
      "Before we move forward, a few things about me. I come from a household that runs a coaching institute. And so, coming to IITK wasn‚Äôt just a dream. It was part of the Tomer code of conduct. I spent a considerable time of my childhood solving sheets of Mechanics and RBD rather than talking to a lot of people. I was given unrestricted access to the internet at an age when no kid should know what 4chan was. Hence, the ‚Äòoveractive imagination‚Äô that my English teacher claimed I had and blamed it to be the cause of my nose-diving grades.",
      "I was a part of the infamous Covid Batch,",
      "So after two online years of changing hairstyles to confuse my peers as to what my actual hairstyle was(only to get a receding hairline on campus due to this damn IITK water), we received the coveted invitation to be able to set our royal posteriors inside an IITK lecture hall rather than wear underwear to CHE211 lectures at 8 in the morning on zoom.",
      "The Online to offline shift reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, where this guy goes on a vacation to a German beach, and then people inexplicably start shooting at him for no reason at all.",
      "Yeah, that‚Äôs what it felt like.",
      "Everyone talks about how good it felt meeting friends and all that jazz, but what hit my introverted-sheltered self first upon coming to campus was the sense that I was gonna have to do my laundry. Couple that with compulsory offline attendance in early morning classes, and I was contemplating taking the first train back to Delhi by the end of the first week, and that‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt tell you about college. How difficult it is to make it past the first week without breaking down.Not just academics and projects or working on cutting-edge research but also things like eating breakfast(something I still haven‚Äôt done successfully) or doing your laundry. College is like playing FIFA against prime BARCA with you having Wrexham United,10 men down.",
      "As a part of my process of fitting into college, I tried my hand at a lot of things. The online sem saw me double time clubs like a high school jock and then end up with no 3rd year POR to speak of as a result. So, if there is one thing I WOULD like for you to take away from here, it is, by all means, explore and try your hand at new things, but,",
      "When people say f*** around and find out, make sure you get to the ‚Äòfinding out‚Äô part and don‚Äôt become a permanent resident of the ‚Äòf*** around‚Äô ville. Because if you do, then the only thing you will have at the end of 4 years is a seeping trauma of all group projects and a perennial hatred for POR holders.",
      "Over time, the ‚ÄòB.Tech‚Äô way of life began to seep in. The cliches became quirks, doing laundry became routine(or an absentee for some), and the people ‚Ä¶ became closer.",
      "Earlier, what had just been a spectre became an entity doomed to roam and haunt the same hallways as me. The strangers occupying the seats at CCD are transformed from polka dots on a sun dress to characters straight out of a Wes Anderson film.",
      "Now, I have been introverted all my life. I have also been rude and crass in places I shouldn‚Äôt have been. Before coming to campus, I thought the world was a bitter place and something best left for others to be dealt with. And I believe that everyone else thought the same of me.",
      "And so, the hive mind of smelly walking Neanderthals I found myself surrounded with seemed to be able to look past my comically large nose, this group of people who weren‚Äôt phased by my insufferable love for movies and books. Or weren‚Äôt phased by my devotion to Star Wars people who..Dare I say it? It actually tolerated me and made me rethink my zombie apocalypse plans.",
      "What was even more surprising is that despite my best efforts at imagining myself as a lonesome honey badger, I found my neural pathways concocting chemicals that resembled what I can only describe as a delightful blend of serotonin-infused confetti and dopamine-fueled fireworks, sparking joy in the most unexpected moments like a Disney parade marching through the wilderness of my mind.",
      "This was the first sign of what I can only describe as a tryst with my laundry. If anyone asks what changed me the most at IITK, the malfunctioning washing machines here would stand first.",
      "But coming to campus was just the beginning, and our nascent minds were due to a seismic shock popularly described as ‚Äògetting a job‚Äô.",
      "I truly believe the intern and placements seasons are just as likely to spawn a radical communist as they are to create a Data Analyst. The environment of those days is something that has shown me humans at all ends of the ‚Äúcharacters in a post-apocalyptic world‚Äù scale.",
      "Everyone from selfless protagonists trying to help everyone out to scheming marauding asses who don‚Äôt tell anyone they have been bitten until the last moment before turning into a zombie. It‚Äôs a time of colossal responsibilities heaped on our infantile shoulders.",
      "So much so that ideas of being ambitious or trying to change the world take a back seat when you are trying to get shortlisted in a mid-tier core firm. But at the same time, this has also shown me some incredible people who have dared to go against the norm and chart their way through rough seas with nothing but a broken slipper and a flip-flop to paddle with. Absolute nut jobs who try their hands at firms way out of their league or try out for endeavours deemed too risky by many. This breed of whacked-out crackheads who, despite everything, dare to take a step forward without thinking of setting up a safety net or a backup first is people who I truly admire.",
      "Although these people were hard to find, and more often than not, they weren‚Äôt in the places you would expect them to be. But unearthing one of those nutjobs on campus was a true delight and a highly recommended experience for anyone.",
      "Now I realize I have been skipping over a lot of stuff here. My time at clubs like Debsoc and ELS, or my encounter with the absolute sitcom characters that were the professors here.The experience of learning about metal electrodes from someone who had spent their entire lives dedicated to that one cylindrical object to meeting incredible people who you knew were either gonna win a Nobel prize or start their own terrorist division was ‚Ä¶something‚Ä¶. to say the least. Professors are a fascinating group of men. They are people who have worked hard to get to where they are today, and their contributions to society far outweigh anything I could hope to achieve, so I believe I am no one to comment on their skill set or credibilities.",
      "Having said that,",
      "I believe there is something to be said about how accurate some of the cliches in Big Bang Theory can be. Academics at IITK is a wild ride, made more so by the sitcomesque professors on our campus. One second, you top a mass transfer quiz, and the next, you are in an HSS class discussing why our society is biased towards poodles rather than pugs.",
      "It is with this dual life of having a hive of friends and a cast of academicians juggling by my side that I sauntered to my final year of college.",
      "By then, the campus irrevocably took home in my heart. This place changed from a pilot episode to a full-blown season. The quirks became endearing, the academics became tolerable, and the hive became larger.",
      "",
      "This place, with its DIY laundry and half-cooked potatoes that had inevitably taken root in my heart(those potatoes gave me dysentery, so the heart wasn‚Äôt the only place they had taken root in), now gently but firmly was telling me to fork off.",
      "",
      "Now, as I do find my posterior being kicked with an IITK logo-shaped boot, I am condemned to look back, and as I leave, I write this, not as a summary of my CV but as a feeble attempt to make a mark on the void. I am hurling words in the darkness of the Vox webpage, hoping someone out there is reading this. To try and chip one stone in this cavernous dungeon. Leaving now makes me wonder if I achieved anything at all. I look across at the corner of my room where the folds of laundry lie washed and clean, and the pictures of my hive adorn my table, and I find myself nodding as I run my hand through the hairline I inevitably lost.",
      "",
      "This is why, when sitting in CCD in one of its wooden armrest chairs, Leaning back to the bitter-sweet smell of coffee wafting through the premises. With the comforting hum of conversation in the back, a small battalion of people waiting to order at the counter, and a teeming mass of CCD workers preparing mispronounced Croissants(K-RO-S-AN, like a Japanese curse word) and black coffees, I found myself surrounded by spectres once again. The faces that seemed familiar and yet completely new.People in the same circle of hell as me, and yet with a different prefix to their roll number as mine. I realized that at that moment, I knew no one in that room. As the coffee arrived and the CCD staff gave me a sad, knowing smile, I realized‚Ä¶this was my cue to leave.",

      "In this 12th edition of As We Leave 2024, Rashmi G R, a graduating Y20 student in the department of Computer Science, writes about her journey as an oddball at IITK, the struggle to embrace its culture and forging a different journey, finding friends despite her rebellious streak and the tiniest bit of learning for both her and you.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "The irony of me writing an AWL was too good to pass up. Why, you ask? You see, I am everything you aren‚Äôt. I can describe myself with more negations than you could with all the sonnets in the world. So, writing an AWL isn‚Äôt very ‚Äúin character‚Äù for me, people would say. I can prove it to you; let‚Äôs see, where do I begin?",
      "I haven‚Äôt had to ‚Äúkholo‚Äù, not once. I have never used IITK lingo; I have never sung my hall anthem. I own not one piece of campus merchandise and have not once shouted, ‚ÄúIITK ka tempo high he.‚Äù I‚Äôve skipped multiple fests, slept under a rock when the entire campus was sweating during an internship season simply because ‚Äúno one told me it was this serious,‚Äù slept through a quiz I studied an entire night for, and never known names of my own wingies. I‚Äôve rolled into a ball and cried in the middle of the road when things were too much and have unironically had conversations with walls to feel less lonely within a campus full of people. I, reader, am many things you aren‚Äôt.",
      "Please don‚Äôt mistake my word vomit with me saying I consider myself somehow above these things or that I am somewhat special, but know that I‚Äôm writing simply because this was a journey too, to tell you that I‚Äôll carry this place with me for the rest of my life, but for reasons very different from yours. I‚Äôm writing to tell you a story that isn‚Äôt very conventional in how people respond to the culture at IITK. All I ask is that you keep an open mind. Too many people make up their minds about people, unlike them before giving them a chance.",
      "After two years of slogging away, I became an ‚ÄòIITian‚Äô ‚Äì to which you are no stranger, I presume. Remote learning was already a wonky start when sleeping through lectures became an easy option and not interacting with peers a norm. I engaged with student club events and tried interacting with just as much passion as the next person. But, I never stopped to think and appreciate the magnitude of this opportunity. Perhaps that‚Äôs why when my grades slipped, my attendance fell, and my interest drowned, I didn‚Äôt regret it all that much. Disassociating was a very easy feat, and I was happy to get addicted to the internet more than the opportunity to study my favourite subject handed to me on a silver platter. The inner rebel in me had already made up her mind. I had begun my silent protest against every piece of culture IITK stood for, self-sabotaging or otherwise. I was playing my own little game of rebellion. Let‚Äôs keep the score: Rashmi ‚Äì 1, IITK ‚Äì 0.",
      "When I finally did make it to campus, it felt like I was starting off with the odds stacked against me. I had no friends, my academic record wasn‚Äôt any good, and suddenly, they were the only things that mattered. I tried very hard to build an igloo in my bed and disappear forever, but there were people who dragged me out. It was hard to resist peer pressure, and I ended up liking hanging out with people more than I should have. I found my best friend and one constant in my roommate very quickly. Some deep conversations at 3 AM are all it took for the rebel in me to start doubting her purpose. I formed some happy friendships. Damnit, IITK ‚Äì 1, Rashmi ‚Äì 1.",
      "The people(and my one constant) who dragged me out of my igloo",
      "I ended my second year learning that it wasn‚Äôt all unicorns and sunshine, even if you wanted to focus on the good. Leave aside the fact that the vast majority don‚Äôt care about equality, empathy or political awareness; they also love to place you in boxes right away and ‚Äòfigure‚Äô you out. Even when you surprise them, they don‚Äôt let you flow beyond the six faces that bound you in their head. Being nice to people isn‚Äôt always received well; scratch that, it never is. Power trips and unabashedly being socially unaware was the new normal, and I wanted no part in it. I was happy not to open my mouth in those chants, not play into the a-year-older-but-oh-so-wiser displays, not even peer at the who-knows-who game or the gift-wrapped bundling of this in the name of culture. What did tempo even mean in this context, anyway? I, at least, was a rebel with a cause! Rashmi ‚Äì 2, IITK ‚Äì 1.",
      "With the onset of the third year, I realised the repercussions of not being ‚Äòyou‚Äô. I had spent the summer avenging a bad grade and floating in the high of the A I replaced it with, to notice that the entire population was running behind internships for the summer. I could surely simply interview when I was ready, right? Companies didn‚Äôt just come all at once in a day, surely. Looking back, I think I was trying to be blissfully unaware. August became October, and when I finally came to my senses after many earfuls from a friend, I had just managed to reign in the rope to impending doom and got myself a decent opportunity in a role I wanted. Note to self: Never do that again. I looked at you with envy, reader, and I finally realised what it meant to fit in. I had to fit in if I wanted to survive. To fit in was to fare better during my journey and, most importantly, after it. IITK ‚Äì 2, Rashmi ‚Äì 2.",
      "I ended my third year here with less clarity than I started about who I was between these walls of IITK. I had group assignments in which I thrived and found classes I was passionate about. I had fun with friends but wasn‚Äôt all that social. I was exceptionally failing a course and cruising through another; couldn‚Äôt handle either, so sat down in the middle of the pavement to bawl my eyes out. A person walking by thought I was hurt and tried to help. Well, the rebel in me was. I only knew one thing about myself then. I was all or nothing about things. It was always nothing till then, but then I had to go and find things in this institute that brought out my all ‚Äì like a few courses and fewer friends. I was losing the battle. IITK ‚Äì 3, Rashmi ‚Äì 2.",
      "The things that brought out my all ‚Äì a few courses and fewer friends.",
      "I was back from my summer, having completed my enjoyable internship with new-found determinism. I didn‚Äôt want a repeat of last year, so people and preparation were my two goals. I would make new friends, and the placement season wouldn‚Äôt be a repeat of my internship. It was all I talked about ‚Äì hope against hope with a CPI I‚Äôm too ashamed to spell and a resume that‚Äôs ordinary at best. I knew nothing about me in that period. I had become another with the sole goal to salvage what was left of these walls. I don‚Äôt know if I became a bigger rebel or a bigger ‚ÄòIITian‚Äô when I skipped my last Antaragni to study for my placements. Surely, the former. Rashmi ‚Äì 3, IITK ‚Äì 3.",
      "The placement season showed me a different side of IITK. The ugly, the happy, the real. I learned that I was nowhere near prepared and had a very small pool of opportunities. I found a good group of friends on day 1 of placements and held on tight while genuine fear ran through my veins. But I knew there was no way out other than the ones you create yourself. I knew to rely on myself when I bet on a company with a big assignment others wouldn‚Äôt. It had paid off, and I had cried tears with a smile for the first time in this place. And at that moment, the rebel in me had folded to the 48-hour marathon I had run with no food or sleep before calling my mom with a smile I couldn‚Äôt shake off. Well played. IITK ‚Äì 4, Rashmi ‚Äì 3.",
      "If you are expecting a great climax with our dear campus emerging on top, I am sorry to disappoint. It has been four months since that smile, and I have felt more like a rebel than ever. It turns out that when you care, this place makes it harder for you to breathe. I found myself living in my head more than ever. My eyes could only see people when they were searching for what I could be useful to them. People will search for what they can take from you ‚Äì bits of your personality (which AI can‚Äôt lend them), items of use (when you yourself aren‚Äôt all that useful) or even your standing in IITK (your branch and the people you know are more useful than you think). I‚Äôm writing this while pondering why the magic didn‚Äôt linger.",
      "But no, I can‚Äôt (in good conscious) add a score to my tally. I found courses/clubs I loved and people who cared even at the tail end of this journey. I probably brought up the bad to make a point. The magic didn‚Äôt stay, but a content feeling did. This place was a bit of an oxymoron. A happy sadness. It is only that I‚Äôm focusing on one over the other while scoring each checkpoint. But for figuring that out, I‚Äôll give myself a point üòâ Rashmi ‚Äì 4, IITK ‚Äì 4 (Yes, I ended on a cliched draw, come fight me).",
      "The courses/clubs I loved and the people who cared.",
      "Now, I have asked you to listen to my story. I have told this in many words, which are motivated by self-preservation, but also with many that aren‚Äôt very crisp, direct, or anything real you would want to read from a senior here at IITK. You want to read a journal of every magical feeling I felt and every tear that preceded a rainbow. But all I had to give to you and me is this. It is cringy and incoherent, uses too many euphemisms to make any sense, and has no meaningful advice. I‚Äôll only fix the last problem for you. Here is what I leave you with:",
      "Oscar Wilde, one of my favourite authors, said, ‚ÄúIt takes a great deal of courage to see the world in all its tainted glory and still to love it.‚Äù As I leave, I take this place and all its people with me for all the colours they have bled into me, not just the cheery summer hues. I look back not only at the happy memories but also at the toughest times because, despite the rebel in me, IITK gave me a place to call my own. I look back content with everything I didn‚Äôt do and sated with everything I did. I leave knowing I‚Äôm not defined by negations or ironic pieces but by these pretty little lies that I tell myself to please the small rebel in me üôÇ",

      "In this 11th edition of As We Leave, Suyash Mallik, a Y20 student graduating in the Department of Electrical Engineering, gives us some of the knowledge he gathered over his time in IITK and shares some of his most precious memories. He introduces us to the idea of a ‚ÄúSatti God‚Äù, and also gives us some advice on how to be one ourselves.",

      "As I sit down to write this AWL, I wonder what it should be ‚Äì a collection of memories that we can look back at 15 years later (with shoutouts to the relevant people in parentheses), a list of practical advice for juniors (and more importantly ‚Äì for myself in the future), or simply a philosophical rant about the nature of life at IITK which no one but me will be interested in. I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind, so I‚Äôm simply going to have a bit of everything in here. Before we begin, I need to set the theme ‚Äì a big overarching idea I have had about IITK is that it is a microcosm of life in general. From the first year ‚Äì your childhood where you come into this new world, all the way to the final year, which is kind of like retirement ‚Äì where you prioritize creating memories with the people who matter the most. In the time between these two extremes I have seen a lot ‚Äì becoming Y21 ka mama by popular vote (rigged tha election), having a near miss with SSAC, making new friends, losing old ones, and even getting impaled! (long story) Looking back, I can‚Äôt point out a period of time and say, oh this was a good semester ‚Äì and vice versa. What I have observed is that my entire time here has been full of moments: both good and bad. Proudly, I can say that I love each of those moments to bits, and would do it all over again in a heartbeat. What follows is my attempt to gather those moments in one place and reflect on them a bit as I leave this intense, wonderful, emotionally draining, and horizon-expanding place.",

      "I came to IITK determined to ‚Äúdo something big‚Äù ‚Äì although I am now of the opinion that the ‚Äúdo something‚Äù part is more important than the ‚Äúbig‚Äù part. From the first day onwards, I was in awe of the sheer diversity of people at this place, and wanted to talk to as many as I could.",

      "From the fateful first MTH101 quiz results, academics quickly took a back seat ‚Äì where it has firmly remained in place ever since, despite repeated disgruntled protests. Interacting with people online was hard, it was like playing a game of chess where you can only see half the board. Still, there were some pretty awesome moments ‚Äì winning the online book club scavenger hunt, an anime quiz where we were shocked to meet a senior who had scored an 11 SPI, and spending hours upon hours shitposting on whatsapp groups with friends. E-cell was also a special experience ‚Äì getting to listen to (and interact with) these amazing people who were working on big, impactful ventures. It went beyond campus events too ‚Äì through E-cell I also got involved in organizing COVID relief resources online, in an effort led by an alum. There were some other things ‚Äì club recruitments, random quizzes and the like which seemed like the end of the world at the time but hardly matter in hindsight. Increasingly, I have come to feel that my time in this world is finite ‚Äì and I would rather devote my time to activities and people that will stick around for the long run. By the time the first semester had ended, I had collected all pass grades ‚Äì A, B, C, and D (over time I have also added E, F and the newly minted ‚ÄúI‚Äù to this list).",

      "From somewhere in the second year onwards I was determined to rise in station from being just a satti to becoming a ‚Äúsatti god‚Äù. Of course, continued disinterest in academics had its consequences. I remember calling home on the last day of the fourth semester ‚Äì after almost failing multiple courses. I was on my H5 roof, crying and telling my mother that I simply could not do EE any more: the nervous breakdown which is part of the Universal Batti Experience‚Ñ¢. I pray to God that coming batches don‚Äôt have to go through the same. It was simply rock bottom for me ‚Äì on top of a turbulent personal life. I owe it to my wingies, family and the friends that stuck around (shout out to Parikshit, Gitika, et al.) that I made it out in one piece. I was glad to be adapting to a post-covid world, even though I will kind of miss watching movies on discord (hello Bansal, Gaurang). In fact, even my taste in films has Vox behind it: I read an AWL by a senior (Shivam Mandloi, Y16). He put me on to the best East Asian cinema, and I still have a small chat with him when I watch a new Korean masterpiece. Just a testament to the kinds of amazing people you can find at IITK, simply by reaching out. Reaching out also helped me a lot when I was looking for internships. I think it was a natural progression, from a tired secy databasing for Outreach AR work to an intern-horny sophomore having short phone calls with people off of linkedin.",

      "Talking to such a diverse set of people made me realize what a big place the world truly is, and that I needed to take charge of my own career. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going off campus to all juniors ‚Äì It takes a lot out of you. I remember sitting all alone in a corner at a friend‚Äôs GPL, depressed about my efforts not returning anything. At the time, Ashutosh offered me his earphones and sat down next to me, to listen to Nirvana together ‚Äì and it helped a huge lot.",

Eventually, I found an awesome internship off campus, and celebrating with my friends was a great experience. Sometimes taking big bets and chasing after moon shots pays off. The third year was a bit different ‚Äì I focused a lot on landing my next intern, but also found myself caught in a stream of new experiences. This was the time when I played Pokemon in EE381 labs, danced in the rain with wingies, was with someone special, and got introduced to ‚Äúrecreational usage‚Äù and Malayalam cinema ‚Äì both by quite different people. I also got back into reading big time ‚Äì now I think college is an apt time to explore books and build your taste. Being a BCS leader was also amazing, and I‚Äôm grateful to have the kind of bonding with our team that wasn‚Äôt possible during the COVID era. Big shoutout to Saurabh, for being generally awesome ‚Äì and the Y21 leaders (should I start calling you ex-coordies now?) for keeping the dream alive. This year also marked our first offline galaxy, which was a blur of Stings and Advances and no sleep ‚Äì it was a breathtaking moment when me and Varad were able to deliver the winning performance in our AniSoc event, after days of screaming our asses off at each other in Japanese.",

      "Other highlights: convincing each other that somehow it would be a very ‚Äúneat‚Äù idea to party the night before a midsem; helping people out with probability and trading games in the weeks leading up to placements. These things might not seem like a lot, but when every moment is imbued with the sense of an ending, you get nostalgic for them even if only a few weeks have passed. Placements was chaos: after spending days running around pushing resumes, adjusting suits and ties, and taking mock interviews ‚Äì watchingyourpeople get placed is a feeling which resonates with the very core of the soul. We made many memories after that as well, e.g. when we went on an amazing trekking trip smack in the middle of the ongoing semester. I‚Äôll also never forget this one day where we ‚Äúate a sandwich‚Äù and spent hours looking (and laughing) at the flowers in H9 quad at peak springtime noon. Our entire wing went from people who had never danced before to gyrating feverishly in front of a crowd of hundreds at DE ‚Äò24. In a batch of almost 1200 people, you are bound to touch others‚Äô lives more often than you expect ‚Äì meeting so many people and saying goodbye has made me realize this.",

It is there in tinkering about late at night with your club, as well as in 14 people in a double room doing a DC assignment together. It shows up even when a Y6 alum makes you do ‚Äútubelight‚Äù in front of his 2 year old child. Most of all, it is in the people you will encounter in this wild 4-5 year ride: and if you are able to build deep relationships with these people ‚Äì you have certainly succeeded in making your mark on IITK culture.",

      "An insight from IITK ‚Äì it is a constant struggle of balancing between finding your interests and investing in building depth in them. Both extremes are sub-optimal for your growth as well as your sanity. This applies to career, hobbies as well as your relationships with other people. You will often find that the balance you have created might be different from what is expected of you, or even what you expect of yourself. In these casesit isalwaysworth it to take a shot on yourself, even if later on things don‚Äôt work out the way you expected them to. After every ‚Äúit‚Äôs so over‚Äù comes a phase of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so back‚Äù, and then the cycle repeats. The reason I have emphasized theSatti God lifestylehere, is not because it is glamorous to ditch your acads and sit around doing nothing instead. On the contrary, remaining a satti via lack of effort does actively make your life harder in a lot of ways ‚Äì and in the best case, should be avoided. However, what being a satti god entails also is the following:",

      "I had a terrible night trying to sleep. Because tomorrow was not just the exam I had been preparing for (JEE Advanced) but also my birthday. My relatives called after the exam to wish me, and before I could say thank you, the next question popped up ‚Äì paper kaisa hua? Here I was, admitted to IITK, decided to go all in to try things out.",
      "I almost feel like the character of Aamir Khan inGhajini, trying to remember the past and getting flashbacks of those memories. Summarising the first 3 semesters is like, if I‚Äôm awake = I‚Äôm on the laptop. And I‚Äôm often in front of the screen and don‚Äôt know why I opened it. I remember joining the SnT orientation (on Zoom) while having dal chawal. Being a fan of video games, I was amazed to find that a new community here that develops games. Amongst the many cool and intimidating SnT summer projects, I chose the one with medium time commitment, Intro to Gamedev. Coordinators seemed like some VIPs. Its evaluation task seemed so difficult that I almost laid down my weapons. But the inner voice said, just do whatever you can and submit. Then, in a very smooth/passive manner, I was learning team management, googling & learning from the web, making timed commitments and game dev obviously. We made our first (Android) game and published it on the Play Store. An appreciation (promotion) mail was sent to all the students. We felt really good as this was that kind of cool stuff we IITians are expected to do, right? SnT projects allow you to dive into any domain you desire from scratch. Of course, one could have chosen another project, or one might not get the desired one. Every decision has its pros and cons. And many times, one mustmake a calculated decision and, with a leap of faith, jump into it with no turning back.If I hadn‚Äôt joined GameDev, my IITK journey (or life?) would have taken a different trajectory. Being involved in clubs helps you find some inspiring seniors, some of whom later turn out to be your mentors in so many situations in life, some amazing batchmates and lots of skills learnt actively or passively.",

      "In the midst of fighting for our right to be on campus and to have an offline semester, we were getting normalized to this IITK on WhatsApp groups, zoom, helloIITK, pingala, prutor, codetantra, gradescope and Brihaspati (iykyk). Chatting on Zoom with private messages during lectures wasourfun. Especially when someone sends it to everyone by mistake. 3rd sem was about learning time management, building a core foundation in MSE, being a GameDev & a DnA secy and participating in different competitions. When I retrospect, those little involvements in various competitions of tech, cult, entrepreneurship‚Ä¶ made me learn some basic skills and develop perspective in different domains that else I wouldn‚Äôt have.",
      "4th sem, we were finally meeting those real faces behind the Zoom screens, visiting places we had only heard stories about, and rapidly learning how to be a senior because my kids were arriving soon. We all know a kid who will not sit in one place and always want something to do. I was (am?) that kid. I was so busy enjoying campus that I contracted COVID within 4 days of reaching. Unexpectedly enjoyed in the yoga hall dorm as well, with no masks, food served to our beds by astronauts (PPE kit heroes), and the announcement sound box as our jukebox.",

      "Campus exploration with random night-outs started. I was the guy who was a friend to many friend groups. I knew many people through some short interactions, and therefore, I used to find myself having a chat with every fourth person in a public place. I looked at it as networking or making good connections. In retrospect, after a certain time, I should have made more conscious efforts to find the person who matches my vibe & passion and deepened my friendship with them. Massive superficial friendship leaves little time for building close friendships, making you feel stuck in maintaining relationships. Moreover, don‚Äôt get too influenced by the judging tags assigned to people. I found this many times that the person behind those tags had a different personality altogether. I am grateful to some friends who stayed by my side in my journeys and helped me climb the ladder.",
      "Then comes the CP-DSA virus. There are many reasons why software development jobs are a prevalent and safer choice for most IITians. But does that career option align with your life goals and how you perceive your future? Many of us skip this question and end up diseased with the CP-DSA virus. Your first job will not govern your life, but at least try to gain the most out of IITK by having a career launch in the direction you like. If you like your branch core, be courageous enough to take it up as a full-time career option in placements or research. You are amongst the best engineers in this nation. There is no doubt that you will get a plethora of opportunities if you are good in some domain. I believe building more in-house products/services to solve campus problems (for starters) is a great opportunity. That may not be monetary, but it will help you learn and showcase your skill set to a large-ready audience. On a greater level, it will help us outweigh ourselves as an entrepreneurial hub. Meeting alums in their batch reunions always caught me amazed. They were all veterans in their fields, full of experiences, who had worked for decades. They used to advise me like their kid.",

I had to work for SURGE, manage SnT summer projects as a GameDev leader and prepare for the coming internship season. Soon, my interaction with Prof Jha & some seniors in MSE played a pivotal role in encouraging me to work towards building our departmental society, named MatSoc. All this in the blazing summer of Kanpur, in which I was a refugee to a room of 3 wingies due to 1 cooler. SURGE ends, I was very clear that research is not my long-term thing üôÇ",
      "One of the best and most unique things IITK has is its culture. It is not just through lingo, intro, and golden rules, but also whenever a student shares a common feeling towards their wing/community/hall/institute. Its unique culture makes you connect quickly with a junior or a decades-old alumni. It is something that we share, build and pass on. It was a driving force for me to work extensively for MatSoc, that I am contributing to forming a new culture for the welfare of my branch and ensuring that it is sustained.",

First, winning the elections and then handling it well. I had to be clear with ‚Äì Does it align with my goals for what I want from my IITK journey? If I lose, can I handle the failure? A major part of my 3rd year went into student communities, and now 4th year, too? I knew I did not have political support. A senior who contested presidential elections once told me, ‚ÄúIf you go to each and every door and campaign, then it is not possible that you lose.‚Äù And I bought that. I believe the campaigning process is something that trains the candidate for the upcoming tenure and hones his/her leadership skills.",

If my co-worker doesn‚Äôt do his job timely and our event fails/suffers due to him, will I accept it? It was a NO always. Due to this, I found myself overworked most of the time. I had stretched myself to my limits in managing everything ‚Äì Acads, PORs, relationships. Much later in the tenure, a close friend of mine made me realize ‚Äì ‚ÄúEach member does not have the same dedication‚Äù. Everyone has and must have their own priorities. These experiences taught me 3 things ‚Äì let others take responsibility for their work, and if the event suffers, we as a team will face it. Second, I was being a perfectionist, which gave me a huge beating when things didn‚Äôt go my way. Third, I should cooperate better at work.

Loneliness is not just having nobody around, but also when you feel nobody around understands you. I had been in the shoes of SnT GenSec for the past 6 months, and WOOSH! everything ends. I learned so many things from this journey that I am grateful to God for. Things like presenting myself, being ultra conscious about choice of words, instituting policies and structure of communities, human behavior, and managing failure. Impromptu public speaking in various situations helped me gain immense confidence. Some situations made me realize my innermost strengths and weaknesses (faster but brutally) that I was unaware of.

It would be a lie if I said that I don‚Äôt have regrets. But none bothers me much as I feel contented by how I tried to put effort into and learn from those experiences.

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Dear Reader, this account isn‚Äôt about a perfect college life; it isn‚Äôt about a sob story; it isn‚Äôt about traversing memory lane and reminiscing the past with treasured recollections of a graduating student. If you‚Äôre here for any of it, I suggest you proceed to other accounts. However, if you‚Äôre someone who views life through the lens of a video game‚Äîwhere every decision matters, success is sought after, but failures are embraced too ‚Äî and you‚Äôre looking for hacks, then you may proceed further. Although linguistic decorations might feel dear to language fanatics, I‚Äôd like to disappoint them here with no fancy literature or descriptions, just authentic experiences in plain vocabulary.",
      "So here begins the account of how I mastered the game named The IITK Odyssey: Quest for Intellect",
      "",
      "Starting this game as a Y20 player wasn‚Äôt very thrilling. The first semester began with new aspirations but an old ambience. You could see what was ahead but couldn‚Äôt feel it through a glass window. Level -I was about understanding the way to crack academics. How to ace quizzes, exams, and assignments. The JEE mode was on, and very few were ready to let go of their old shells. Had this level not been virtual, the players would‚Äôve had more opportunities to discard their old armour, which they didn‚Äôt know was restricting their growth. The comfort level, though, in this level was max. Wake up, attend Zoom lectures, take online quizzes (equipped with innovative ways to prevent plagiarism), socialise over Zoom calls with closed cameras, exchange some funny Whatsapp stickers, eat, sleep, and repeat.",
      "I talked to many peers to find out how they cracked this level. The info revealed that many like me surrendered to their introverted desires, letting go of the dream of socialisation. Being captured in four walls with a virtual window was a pass time for many, other than memorising Art history, the Gauss Law, the Bolzano‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem, the syntaxes of C, and so on.",
      "The second semester, however, was about reflecting on what you did last semester. This sense is even stronger if you do not get an ‚ÄòA‚Äô in your first mail of grades. You feel sad about how you gave away your love for literature, art, and music for nothing. So you try to engage in clubs and fests. The freshmen year teaches you how just relying on yourself is a sin. Reaching out to people would‚Äôve helped you crack this level efficiently. However, at the end of the day, what matters here is learning and exploring what IITK is. The lingo, the culture, and most importantly, the people. For seekers and worshipers of academic excellence, you could do without any of the above, but trust me, life would then have decorated emptiness.",
      "Hacks:Socialise, engage in clubs, don‚Äôt neglect studies, look beyond academics, and explore IITK(which wasn‚Äôt an option for Y20 players, but okay).",
      "",
      "This level‚Äôs first half was like the last level, with online 3rd sem, while its other half was what the first level should‚Äôve been like. The Sophomore year starts with the dawn of responsibilities. You need to figure out what you actually want to do in life. You need to make learned choices. Again, interaction is required at this level, but along with it, you need determination. This level isn‚Äôt as easy as level I. You make decisions related to which clubs and societies you are serious about. You need to decide if you‚Äôre interested in research or if you‚Äôre made for the corporate world.",
      "Sometimes, you would want to vent out, and then your friends, whom you trust, come into play to have your back. Gladly, I had that girl to share my thoughts and gripe about MTH and lean on while managing the academic workload.",
      "Y20s ended this level offline on campus. While the third sem was as chill as can be, the fourth sem was equally worse. A new environment could be intimidating, and you could lose yourself in the crowds. The key point here is don‚Äôt prioritise fun over fight. Fight to get your CPI and CP covered for the internship season, which will begin at the next level. Also, take up projects that interest you. If you are from a department like MTH, the academic journey in this and upcoming levels is going to be a bit demanding if you don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúreal maths‚Äù (I‚Äôd refrain from elaborating on the term, but you‚Äôll know it once you take up any abstract course in MTH).",
      "",
      "Your friend circle influences you a lot. And many of you might have heard: ‚ÄúYou will be the average of the five people you spend the most time with.‚Äù So, while choosing your companions wisely is the key, sometimes they run into you. Who would have imagined that a casual breakfast conversation with your behen on a random summer morning, discussing the idea of shifting together, could lay the groundwork for a lifelong friend circle. This way, the end of this level gave me 6 adorable companions who profoundly influenced my journey and helped me rise again every time I fell down.",
      "Hacks:Improve your CPI, practice coding regularly, take up projects, and make meaningful friendships (which will eventually help you crack the upcoming levels)",
      "Here, you play the character of a Junior undergraduate. This level begins with the internship season. You receive hell if your CPI is less than a certain limit. But eventually, by the end of it, you figure out how to make things work in life. You learn that there is more than one way to tackle any problem. More than half are disappointed by the first half of this level, the fifth sem. This semester not only reflects your skills but also unveils the true nature of your companionships.",
      "The companions I had here helped me walk through this rough level where I bagged no internship in phase 1. Apart from that, I also had the Head, Design position in Techkriti. Designing was what helped me embrace my flaws and turn them into strengths. Any such hobby can help you be calm against the storm of inferiorities stirring inside your head. Additionally, it helps maintain momentum in academics and other aspects. Conducting a fest awaited by everyone isn‚Äôt an ordinary feeling. People say things turn toxic in these environments, but lotus also thrives in muddy water. The person you become after surviving it would exude a tantalising aura. Moreover, the bonds forged while working together under such pressures are unforgettable. Lastly, when you stand at the Pronite stage gazing down at the ecstatic crowd, you‚Äôll feel the satisfaction seeping in.",
      "The end of this level takes you to the beginning of your adult life ‚Äî the internship. You‚Äôll set foot into a new phase. You‚Äôll get a glimpse of the future. You‚Äôll understand the value of time and weekends. By the time you finish this level, you‚Äôll see the placements approaching. All this would be intimidating, but you‚Äôll learn to tackle it with time.",
      "Hacks:Keep hustling till the end, don‚Äôt lose hope, Use the summers wisely.",
      "This level is equally hell and heaven. This has the pains of placements and the pleasure of pals. Things would seem to be falling apart, but then, miraculously, everything would fit into place. And in the end, your fear would be about losing the four golden years of life. In the seventh sem, you‚Äôll see your time running away with endless placement tests and interview preparation. This would be the sem where you won‚Äôt feel happy after finishing your Endsems. However, you don‚Äôt have to cease spending quality time with friends, occasionally going out for movies or dinner with your buddies. PPO babies will have the best time of their life this semester. Fighting together will help you the most throughout the placement season. You could never forget the last dinner you all had together before D-day.",
      "",
      "And, above all, there are those whom you can count on for everything. I had such friends to hear me out when I vent out my ‚ÄòBT‚Äô, to motivate me to keep going, to whom I could go and tell in detail how the interviews went. The day your placement portal is frozen is the day you‚Äôll never forget in your life. And when there are people who scream in joy before you can process what happened, you know you‚Äôve hit the jackpot in life, apart from your career.",
      "The last semester, the end part of this level, would be about making memories. Although it seems the easiest part of this game, it is the most difficult. You are processing the fact that the journey with your peeps is about to end, that you won‚Äôt be together anymore after these few months. You reflect on the friendships that have been forgotten and those that have endured.",
      "You attend your last Techkriti as an ex-core and witness how far you‚Äôve come. You make your last happy memories with the people who were there with you till the end of this journey, the Strangers who became your Owns. You participate again in Galaxy with your cutest friend and win the competition you lost last year.",
      "You study but just to pass. Ultimately, even seeing three straight ‚ÄòA*‚Äôs in your last mail of Grades won‚Äôt matter much. The sadness of losing people you wished to celebrate this with would weigh more than your academic journey from no A to A*.",
      "Lifting each other throughout the journey is what makes this game fruitful. When you see yourself dressed in Sarees and Kurtas for farewell or in blazers, shorts, and goggles for early morning photoshoots, you‚Äôll find around you a bunch of people and a whole lot of memories, small and big. After the completion of this game, your most prized possession would be the memories; the memories of dancing endlessly in the clubs and fests, the memories of celebrating festivals like you never did before, those of spending hours at canteen gossiping and discussing life updates & feminism, those of working at hall 1 till 12 just iterating and improving the designs for posts, those of solving each other‚Äôs MTH doubts, those of spending whole night doing ‚ÄúHindi Vartalap‚Äù with roommates, ranting at hours about why pre-registrations are a waste, those of exploring terraces and buildings in acad area, those of random late night walks, those of fun movie nights, those of playing games and cooking together, those of proof-reading endless grad school essays, those of spontaneous door knocks asking to join for tea, those of planning the trips, those of clicking endless pics and reels on the trips, those of helping each other get ready for events, those of dancing and laughing endlessly at ‚ÄúHall 1 ki Baraat‚Äù and those of taking a reckless decision that transformed life for the best.",
      "Hacks:(First half) Keep going, don‚Äôt skip meals, drink water, stay healthy, and don‚Äôt take stress. (Second half) Make as many memories as possible so you don‚Äôt regret anything later.",
      "",
      "Trophies:",
      "If you pass all the above levels successfully, you‚Äôll get some rewards in return. These include:",
      "",
      "This game would make you intellectual in the true sense, where you‚Äôd realise that life isn‚Äôt just about acquiring knowledge but about gaining experiences. This game could change a homesick teenager into a clingy, sentimental adult ardently postponing the last journey back home.",
      "At the end of it all, you leave your hall gate after hugging a bunch of people with tears in their eyes. From the window inside your last train to home, you see crying faces running outside, waving you goodbye. That is the moment you know you won this game. You won in life!",

He writes about his Inter IIT experience with aerial robotics team. It will definitely bring a smile to your face when you decipher it step by step.",
      "Disclaimer: The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "This is the story of my time with Team Aerial Robotics. I have tried to write it in a different style. Everything in the article, from incidents to names, is directly linked to something in the real world. If you cannot figure out what a particular reference is, you aren‚Äôt thinking hard enough. And for those of you inclined towards history and literature, all of the names used are connected to either historical or literary characters. To start off, I‚Äôll tell you that Rurik represents the Y20 Team Heads, which includes me.",
      "",
      "Read on folks.",
      "Prologue",
      "Rurik had received the crown from his people. But rather than an air of celebration, the mood at the coronation was of sobriety and mourning. The crown was once the owner of vast estates in the Heli Labs. But the present was far from glorious. All that remained was a rump state, if even that. Rurik was no king, merely the leader of dervishes. They had no home to call their own and no army worthy of conquering one. TheAerianswere in dire straits, and it was no secret. Rurik was not a newcomer to his dynasty‚Äôs problems. The present state of affairs was brought about by the Great Plague. The plague had turned many great realms to dust, and Rurik‚Äôs ancestors had done well to keep theAeriansalive. While they lacked the resources of the great empires, and recovery would be long and arduous, theAerianscounted themselves fortunate to have survived the Plague.",
      "Part 1: The dancing dervish",
      "Rurik‚Äôs famed ancestors had once led troops across the Black Chasm into Iberia, and his people clamored to repeat the feat. Rurik, however, knew that any promises of a campaign such as this could only be empty. The Aerian armies were bare, the fleets were non-existent, and morale had been sapped. His immediate goal would thus be to rebuild his broken military and claim a home for his people.",
      "Rurik attempted to build a home in Praetorium Quinque and Praetorium Duo numerous times. One of these is burned into the hearts of the Aerians for the remarkable insult it embodied.",
      "Through negotiations, Rurik had secured a small patch of barren land in Praetorium Quinque. Even in this godforsaken place, the Aerians built a semblance of a home. That was until one day, Praetorium Quinque commanded them to leave and do so within a week. The Aerians attempted to appeal, but no one truly cared for them. They were forced to gather what they could on their backs, and Praetorium Quinque set fire to the rest. It was a raw demonstration of power. The land would again be barren after Rurik was driven out, a marker of shattered dreams and broken hopes.",
      "Part 2: The taste of a hearth, Praetorium duo",
      "The Nauticans were old friends of Rurik. While the plague had battered them too, they still held their lands, unlike the dispossessedAerians. This friendship would soon prove invaluable for Rurik.",
      "He planned a campaign against theShastraand appealed to the Nauticans for help against the common foe. The Nauticans were willing to allow the Arrians into their lands for the campaign‚Äôs duration. The news was greeted with great fanfare. After years of dervishdom, would they have some place to call their own? It was not theirs in any real sense, but they were no longer nomads. The sinews of war began to tighten. Rurik drilled his troops relentlessly and built his engines of war. During this time, the Aerians built one of their most beloved siege engines. Some would call it theFerrum pedites. Otherswould name it theHomme de Ferre.TheIronfoot, as this engine will be referred to in this text, will soon meet its first test.",
      "Part 3: The Ironfoot",
      "Rurik initiated the campaign in winter. It was the first time he led men into battle, and his inexperience showed. But he had prepared his army well. The Aerians laid siege to the Shastran fortress of Gundabad. The belovedIronfootwould prove critical to the assault that would finally take this castle. Rurik was quite surprised; he had not expected this victory, which made it all the sweeter. With the fall of Gundabad, the way to the Shastran capital of Madras lay wide open. If the Aerians of today had such an opportunity, they would have laid waste to Madras, but Rurik‚Äôs time was different. While he had a functioning army, he did not have the logistical resources to attack Madras. Greater fights were coming up, and he intended to save his hosts for those.",
      "Part 4: The Tenth Technician War",
      "The great Technican Institutes were once again at war. As the vast war machines of these empires cranked into motion, smaller powers often sought to strengthen their position by participating in these conflicts in the hope of reward. Rurik and his men owed their loyalty to Kanpur according to old feudal customs, and they decided to honor the same.",
      "Rurik‚Äôs troops had gained a reputation for siege warfare and attempted to utilize this reputation to gain concessions from the Technicia Kanpuria. Praetorium Duo fell under Kanpuria jurisdiction, and after negotiations, theSanctum TechniciumwithinPraetorium Duowas granted to the Aerians for the duration of the war. We shall refer to it by the name SnT room for the rest of the text.",
      "The Drona Campaign",
      "Covering the history of the Great Drona Campaign is outside the purview of this text. To summarise, we can state that The Campaign lasted the entire winter and extended into the next spring. It was the most brutal fighting Rurik had endured and was marked by a constant lack of provisions and equipment in difficult terrain. The issues were often exacerbated by poor coordination from the high command. One incident stands out.TheDronatribe, whose lands would become the center of the fighting, had agreed to a parley with the warring parties. There would have been valuable tactical and strategic information on offer. Rurik was eager to participate in the conference. However, the high command completelyforgotto inform Rurik of the location and time. To add to the travesty, none of the high command attended the conference. Incidents like these would be sadly common for many who served Technicia Kanpuria. While Rurik did not have expectations of any useful aid from the central command, the apparent sabotage of his efforts was utterly exasperating.",
      "After months of grueling effort, the culmination of this campaign would come at the Battle of Empiar in¬† March 2023. There are sparse records of this battle, but we do have some Aerian memoirs to go by. Rurik arrayed his forces against the enemy in the early morning, but battle only commenced in the afternoon. Rurik saw Kanpuria banners rising over his left flank as the fighting raged. Before he could react, the men bearing these banners charged, but not against his enemy. They crashed heavily into Rurik‚Äôs left flank, ripping it asunder. Though shaken by the treason, Rurik had maintained enough control over his army to withdraw in good order. While Rurik would later reform his troops and launch a devastating night assault to claim a hard-won victory, this treason would deeply scar the Aerians.",
      "Eventually, peace would be signed in the Tenth Technican War. Technicia Kanpuria had sustained some serious setbacks in the war. The Eleventh Technican War would bring complete and utter disaster to the Kanpurians. However, that was in the future. The results of the Tenth War had already begun to spark unrest.",
      "The Politikia",
      "We shall not cover the civil unrest that erupted in the wake of the Tenth Technican War in this text. It is a long story, and for brevity‚Äôs sake, we must move on. To summarise, Kanpurian setbacks in the war became a key theme in the struggle for power that followed. Rurik distanced himself from political struggle. Greatly disillusioned and with scars of the Technican War still burning bright in his memory, he refused to attach his name to the Grand Council of Kanpuria.",
      "The Implications of the Drona Campaign for Rurik",
      "The Shastran Campaign, followed by the Drona Campaign, had proven the Aerian mettle. The Sanctum Technicium was firmly under Rurik‚Äôs grip by now. While there would be some attempts to usurp it by the Techno-governor of Praetorium Duo, they would be thwarted. The Techno-governor had attempted to seize the holdings of both the Aerians and the Nauticans. However, he was forced to retreat. He would eventually exile himself for many months, which ended the brewing unrest.",
      "The continued conflicts had provided Rurik with a clear heir. Rurik had no children of his own. However, over the long years of war, a talented young commander, Oleg, had risen through the ranks. And thus it was that on a solemn morning in April of 2023, Rurik abdicated from his position as the king of the Aerians. Then he crowned Oleg and gave him the following words as a parting gift:",
      "While the Gods did not see it fit for me to bear a son, you are no less than a son to me. I have seen Odin‚Äôs strength in your eyes. I see in you the flame that will cut a swath across this land and bring vast glory and prosperity to our nation. I pray that you may never falter, and yet if you feel your heart shiver, know that I stand with you until the moment I draw breath.",
      "A portrait of Rurik and Oleg",
      "Some parting words",
      "Today, Oleg‚Äôs reign has run its course. It has been illustrious, and he has far surpassed the achievements of his father, Rurik. Oleg himself had this to say about his reign:",
      "You know the poem ‚ÄúThe Road Not Taken‚Äù? There are two roads, and I am walking on the damned grass.",
      "Oleg, much like his father, did not have any sons, or at least any that were worthy of being the king of the Aerians. Eventually,Yaroslavascended to the Aerian throne.",
      "In the meantime, Rurik had grown older. Yet he had watched the fortunes of theAeriansrise. He reflected on the times of his youth when they were but wandering dervishes. As he lay on his deathbed, soon to become little more than a memory, he smiled. He had seen Yaroslav, a man whose prowess was far beyond Oleg, and Oleg himself had proven stronger and wiser than he had. From the ashes of the Great Plague, the phoenix had risen, and it had not yet stopped its ascent. Rurik closed his eyes for the last time and saw the gates of Valhalla open before him. His time had come, and he would pass to Odin with a heart full of joy.",

      "In the 7th edition of AWL 2024, Hisham Hadi T, a Y20 graduate from the Electrical Engineering Department, takes readers on an enthralling adventure that not only tests his courage but also evolves his friendships.",
      "Disclaimer: The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Vox asked me to submit this AWL by the 20thof April. So here I am ‚Äì on the 21st‚Äì starting to write it. That‚Äôs one thing that hasn‚Äôt changed at all in the four years of my stay here. Like Benjamin Franklin said, ‚ÄúDo not do today what you can do on deadline day‚Äù.",
      "Of course, the biggest writing block was deciding what to write about. I foraged through my IITK memories to find the best thing to share as I graduate, but I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with anything I found. And then I realized, my most memorable IITK story happened a couple hundred miles away from IITK.",
      "It was my fifth semester, and mid sem recess was coming up. The internship drive had tag teamed with acads to wrestle us, and we all were dying for an excuse to relax. One late night, sitting in front of a closed CCD, we drew up a detailed itinerary for a Jaipur trip and then decided to go to Mussoorie.",
      "There were eight of us: me, Anand, Melvin, Adheena, Sahil, Drishty, Divya and Rahber. We set out on the 30thof September on a train to the mountains. The josh was high by the time we reached Mussoorie. We had spent the previous day rafting in Rishikesh, and once you‚Äôve been in the turbulent waters of the Ganga being pushed around by waves and friends alike on the first day, you‚Äôre yearning for that sort of adventure throughout the trip.",
      "The Gang(Rishikesh)",
      "The rooms we had booked, although away from the town, were within walking distance from Kempty Falls. In other words, Kempty Falls was our personal ice-cold swimming pool. It‚Äôs not your typical high-rise waterfall; it‚Äôs a series of small terraced falls. Waterfalls on one level, forms a full-sized pool of water, and then falls to the next level below. The lowest level is the most popular, as it‚Äôs the first pool people see as they ascend the hill. The further up you go, the less explored the falls and pools get.",
      "In Kempty Falls (Rahber, Divya and Melvin)",
      "And you are college students with a fetish for adventure running in your veins in place of blood. You won‚Äôt settle for the half package; what is doable, you‚Äôll do it. What just might be doable, you‚Äôll try that too. It‚Äôs something about that age. And that‚Äôs why five of us kept climbing up the hill, level after level, until eventually reaching the highest accessible point, a calm pool of chilly water formed by a wide fall of about two feet in height. We were having fun.",
      "For the most part, the pool was shallow. The water level would settle a little below your waist, deep enough to swim but shallow enough to get out of the water if you feel too cold. But if you get close to the fall, the ground takes a sharp change in slope, and it soon gets as deep as a man and a half. In our group, I was the best swimmer, while Melvin and Divya could swim reasonably. Adheena and Rahber, on the other hand, were foreign to the art. So, while they stayed in the shallow area, the swimmers were making frequent trips to the deep part.",
      "Right about where the fall was, there was a rock rising out of the water. Soon, we were climbing onto it and jumping or diving into the deep water. Anyone who swims knows that diving is the best part. And the sensation of penetrating freezing water, the feeling of the coldness enveloping you head to feet, was adding to the thrill. While Divya, Melvin and I took turns on the rock, something else was bubbling up in Rahber ‚Äì FOMO.",
      "He wanted to try. Getting on the rock wasn‚Äôt an issue, as it could be approached from the other side, where the water was shallow. The complicated part would come after the jump, getting back from the deep zone. We thought about it, and it seemed doable. He could make the jump, and I could drag him to the shallows once he did. We had two backup swimmers as well. What could possibly go wrong?",
      "There were two things. We found out the hard way.",
      "Rahber was soon standing on the edge of the rock, but he couldn‚Äôt get himself to jump just yet. Anyone who has been in that position knows the difficulty of finding the courage to jump into water you know is deeper than you. Melvin followed him to the rock to talk some motivation into him while I waited at the edge of the shallows, giving my own words of encouragement. A couple more minutes of stalemate, and then it happens. Rahber makes the jump. I immediately knew things had gone wrong.",
      "The thing that could go wrong, number one, a¬† communication gap. Rahber was not a diver; he jumped his feet first. That wasn‚Äôt a surprise, though. I was expecting him to jump in my direction so that he would cover some distance, and I would carry him the rest of the way. But I hadn‚Äôt explicitly told him this; I was kind of taking it for granted. Instead, he jumped towards the fall side, quite near the rock itself, and was already struggling to keep his head above the water, flipping about frantically and gasping for air. I needed to hurry.",
      "I swam quickly in his direction, but there was no way I could get hold of him without him calming down first. His arms were being flung in every direction as if to catch a ball of air that was evading him, and his legs were kicking strongly into the water, albeit futilely. I realized that what he needed first was not saving; it was breath. As I reached him, I dived underwater myself and planted my feet on the ground. Then I caught hold of his waist and lifted him up like Simba by the monkey in The Lion King.",
      "A few seconds like that. Rahber savors his first pure gulp of air since jumping in. The restless arms and legs relax, and the panic starts to subside. But all is not well yet. As he is regaining his composure, under the water I am losing my breath. This can‚Äôt go on indefinitely; I must come back to the surface. The plan is simple: once Rahber has calmed down, he should take one deep breath and be ready to go underwater again. I will let him go and get some air myself and then bring him up and swim him to the shore. Except there‚Äôs one problem. It‚Äôs not like he has prior experience being saved from drowning, and there‚Äôs no way I can communicate this to him from under the water. But there‚Äôs no time to come up with a better plan; I am almost out of breath and need to resurface. I let go of his waist.",
      "The thing that could go wrong, number two, the panic. Understandably, the drowning man is not a very rational being. All that matters to the drowning man is staying alive, and if I may use a DSA term you all are familiar with, he will use only a greedy algorithm to do it. You can‚Äôt ask a drowning man to take a step back so that he leaps forward, and you can‚Äôt blame him for that.",
      "Imagine the feeling of the ground beneath your feet suddenly disappearing, you suddenly finding yourself in quicksand. That must be how Rahber felt when I let go of him, and the panic was back faster than the flash. He didn‚Äôt know I was just taking a breath, and from his point of view, he was back in the nightmare of drowning. And in that situation, he does the only thing he can do ‚Äì use me as leverage.",
      "In the panic of the moment, he pushes down on me to stay above water. And I don‚Äôt have the breath left to be able to afford that. The roles have reversed now, and I am the one drowning. Underwater, I am fighting his hard grip to make him let go, but he‚Äôs holding on for dear life, kicking the water desperately. This could have been the end.",
      "Thankfully, the friends waiting in the shallows realized that I had been underwater too long. Without losing a beat, Melvin jumped in from the rock and took hold of Rahber, making him relax his grip just enough for me to break free and resurface and launch myself to the edge of the shallows where Adheena and Divya were standing. There, neck deep in water but feet finally on solid ground, I hit my lowest point mentally.",
      "The pungent reality of the possibility that one of us ‚Äì the saver or the savee ‚Äì might not make it out of this hit me like a tsunami. I could see Melvin fighting the same battles I fought a couple of minutes ago, and I knew that, just like me, he couldn‚Äôt keep it up forever, either. While not proficient enough in swimming to carry Rahber on his own, being an athlete meant that Melvin had a better lung capacity than me. Still, it‚Äôs not a limitless resource. Something had to be done fast.",
      "I was still recovering from the shock of being the drowning man myself; all those times my parents told me to be careful of the water flashed in my mind. They would say it every time I went on a trip, and I would casually assure them that I would. But at that moment, my head was above water, and the world was sinking. Air was all around me, and yet it felt suffocating. But inaction wasn‚Äôt an option for any of us.",
      "No words were spoken. No plans were discussed. We just knew that none of us was going to fix this alone. I could try swimming to Rahber and taking Melvin‚Äôs place, but both me and Adheena knew it wouldn‚Äôt achieve much. We needed all of us to pull this off.",
      "Me and Divya started moving towards Rahber. Behind me, Adheena placed her feet firmly on the edge of the shallows and held out her hand to me. I took it and in turn, extended my other hand to Rahber as far as I could. But I still wasn‚Äôt close enough. From behind Rahber, Melvin gave him one strong push, and Divya, who had approached swimming from the side, caught hold of the collar of his shirt and gave it a firm pull, bringing him just close enough to me for him to extend his arm and connect with me. The shirt tore a little with the force of the pull, but it had done the trick. Rahber, who was now more composed as the initial shock of drowning had receded, extended his arm to me, and as soon as I connected, Adheena took her cue and pulled strongly. Melvin and Divya did their part too, pushing us from the other side, and all five of us huddled towards the shallows.",
      "Everyone is Safe (At a lower pool. Melvin lightens the mood, as Rahber walks with his now torn shirt and I sit processing what just happened)",
      "Sunshine. Air. Relief.",
      "The moment was serene; everyone was safe, and we knew that everyone was safe. The comfort of that knowledge is indescribable. The ice-cold water around us wasn‚Äôt bothering us. We were talking about what had just happened, sharing the scariest parts for each of us, expressing what went through each of our minds at various points, and even laughing about it for a couple of minutes.",
      "You might ask how we could laugh about something like this. But you see, there is something about almost dying that makes you appreciate life so much more.",

      "In this 6th edition of As We Leave, Aumkar Jahagirdar, a graduating Y20 student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, narrates his challenging yet transformative journey at IIT Kanpur, highlighting experiences beyond academics.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "My journey at IITK is not for the light-hearted but for those who know how to face challenges. Also, I would not be stating any facts/stories concerning academics; I guess everyone here is to explore what IIT Kanpur has to offer along with academics. It was November 20 when I received my first call from my SG. I was despondent, and for many, it was very frustrating to see their start at IITK in the online mode. Many of them didn‚Äôt wish to be home as they were missing offline orientation and fun activities, but for me, who was going through family disputes, it was tough to see things from a normal perspective.",
      "Online mode made most people lazy(obviously me too). There were a lot of students who entirely depended on cheating for better grades. I was surprised when someone passed me the answers written by me! After witnessing such activity, students who used to study were the ones who became vulnerable. As time passed, I tried to keep myself engaged with the sport I excelled in during my school years.",
      "One of my major achievements before gettingto IITK was being a national level player in Mallakhamb.",
      "April 21 was the first regular senate meeting where students discussed problems and proposals to return to campus. For me, who didn‚Äôt know how things worked, I thought the Gymkhana was to be blamed. During a GBM, as a first-year freshman, I had raised my voice in senate meetings to which seniors were shocked; shocked because no freshman should act in the same way as I did. I did gather a lot of attention from my batchmates, but for seniors, I did become an idiot. Many seniors I knew told me not to act the way I did, but I ignored them all.",
      "After this incident, I knew I would not have a good image among seniors and some of my batchmates, but this entirely depended on what I would do in the future. After a breakout of online protests towards the reopening of campus, they called all the resource-constrained students to campus. I, too, had applied and got the opportunity to be on campus before my batch came here. I and my wingies enjoyed interacting with our seniors(Ajit, Vatsal, and Ridham, who eventually became Heads of Antaragni and many more). We got great exposure to what to do on campus and how to manage our academics, along with having fun on campus.",
      "My seniors had advised me to stay away from the ‚ÄúElection‚Äù, to which I did not pay attention. Eventually, one of my wing chachas, Nirmal, was contesting for the post of PSG. He was COSHA convenor at that time and had a lot of fame. Since we all decided to support him for the cause, we made many mistakes. Also, there were a few instances that I used to consider as misconduct from the side of EC. I remember how I used to be angry and how aggression drove me when I heard the word EC. But I had my reasons to feel so.",
      "I also considered contesting for senator in my second year, for which I started preparing much before the election announcement. In reaction, the EC of IITK warned me about my misconduct, and I agreed to stop all of my activities. Since I thought that EC was ahead of me, I started digging up EC members to be aware of what was coming next. To my surprise, I found about 70-80 members of my batch who were part of EC, many of whom were already my friends. From that day onwards, I understood that not everyone could be trusted who is around you.",
      "02/01/2022",
      "I was on my train to campus when I received a call from the EC manager. He told me I had to be present so EC could question me. On reaching campus, I had to show up at RT-PCR at the Health Center only, after which I could enter my Hall of residence. EC picked me up and started my interrogation. I had a lot of heated arguments with the EC- CEO and the managers, and in the end, I got fined. I was very angry at that moment that a student decided what penalty other students deserved. Also, I was not in a state to understand that I was very wrong at that point.",
      "But destiny was cruel; with the time that passed, I withdrew my nomination from contesting for senator. After that, on the same afternoon, we found out that my chacha, who was contesting for the post of PSG, his nomination was cancelled. At the same time, there were 2 other candidates whose nomination was cancelled by the EC. We were furious about the ongoing events and tried to rebel in all possible ways. One of the candidates was driven to consider self-harm due to these events. That night was disturbing, but I had what we call our wingmates,‚ÄúBrothers‚Äù.",
      "One of my wingmates took me to meet one of the well-known seniors of my Hall, Mohit Gupta, whom I had never heard about.He was among the most amazing seniors I have met at IITK. He consoled me and made me realise what to look towards in the future. He did tell me about the infamousNOTA Campaigning,and did warn me not to get involved in any way.",
      "Still, this mind does not wish to stop at all. After thorough planning with my fellows, we started promoting NOTA campaigning in a way that was never thought of by the campus. We did not succeed in the end, but the impact was very bad on the campus community. I was scared that I could be easily grabbed by the fingers of SSAC. I remember pulling all the strings that I could to stop my name from getting into the list of SSAC, just to prevent any harm to my career at IITK due to someone‚Äôs personal vendetta. Mohit was really angry at me as I was the one who dragged myself into the same situation. It reminded him of the situation when 52 students(including him) got disciplinary action against them for NOTA promotion during by-elections. But by grace, somehow, action was not taken against me. At last, the EC-CEO was impeached by the Senate for unfair conduct.",
      "After that, I started to work for my Hall and aimed to become hall president. I was never in any sub-committee, but I managed to get the work done. At that time, H-12 had severe maintenance problems. To start with culture, I began to learn about many seniors, and along my journey, I met a lot of Y‚Äô18s. I shared my vision with them, taking their experience before they left us.",
      "A few days later, I had knee surgery, so I could not take the lead at the SNT code organised by Y ‚Äô18s. It was the most amazing night that my batchmates experienced. A blessed night to witness the Hall Rivalries with all the seniors of my Hall and other Halls. During these days, the code of conduct doesn‚Äôt allow slang and imposes penalties for doing so, but Y20s experienced the night when there were no such barriers. An open field of battle where there is no one to stop you. Indeed, it makes those nights a wonderful memory for my batchmates. This is why my whole batch of Y20 had such a good Hall bonding.",
      "Culture Awaits All, Just Embrace it",
      "Along with my fellow batchmates, we pushed for the new HEC, which was accepted by the Warden on July 22. There were a lot of challenges & there were very few seniors on whom we could count to help us. I still remember my first day of becoming Hall president. A few students of my Hall visited Bithoor and had a situational accident where a Y‚Äô17 lost his life. I was too inexperienced to handle the situation. There were a lot of visitors to my Hall from the administration, and I never knew how I should deal with them. Still, we handled the situation. Believe me when I say the most challenging thing in this world is to see the parents cry and collect the belongings of their child, who is no longer in this world.This incident was the reason which led to thecontinuation of entry-exit registration for students at the main gate.",
      "A few days later, with my HEC and Warden‚Äôs permission, we called the GBM of my Hall juniors residing in H-13. After letting them know about the Hall rivalries and a lot of shouts of slogans, we let them go back to their Hall. But it had the opposite impact on them. With heated arguments, there was a mishap where a Y‚Äô21 had used a knife to threaten one of my juniors. I got a call from H-13 and ran there ASAP. Being just in time, 2 security guards were to call the control room to report everything, but I intervened and explained to them not to do so to save him from disciplinary actions. He felt sorry and apologised, and there was a compromise between those two. One should not let heated arguments be the reason for getting their career sacced here. After the very same, I was criticised by many people for intervening in the situation; most of them felt it was wrong to have them compromised. But in the end, what matters is to save someone‚Äôs career rather than making him feel the mistake for the rest of his life.",
      "A new HAP was proposed, and to my information, I was about to manage a hall of 900+ students. My HEC had to address many issues daily, assuring them it would be done soon. It was August, and there were only debates in the Hall group about maintenance issues. There were plans in order, but they took time due to the official process. In the same way, to divert their attention from the thinking that no one is working, we organised some cultural events that made them believe that work is undergoing but taking time.",
      "Around this time, I had a heated argument with one of my hallmates, and I had some miscommunication issues with my Warden sir, too. It made me realise that, being nominated, there were a lot of people who were ready to suppress me. Around the same time, I met with another great GEM of IITK,¬† Snehil Saluja(founder of Overlayy), ex Hall- President of H-12 during the Y‚Äô18 batch. Even though he was Y‚Äô17, he took up the responsibility of Hall president during the Y‚Äô18 batch, and he made me realise the importance of being elected rather than nominated. His journey of life had been very rough, with a lot of financial issues during college life, losing his father just around the days before the JEE exam; really seeing his situation would give anyone goosebumps. He, too, was nominated president due to some issues in the HEC election of Mohit Gupta(Y‚Äô18) Vs Deepak Kumar(Y‚Äô18- Former Udghosh Festi). I resigned from being nominated president and requested my Warden sir, to have by-elections so that I could finally be elected. By-elections took place in October, and I won the election with a massive margin of 600+ votes.",
      "It was when I realised that most of my Hallmates looked up to me for leading them, and I never wished to let them down. Within 2 months, I had spent 14 Lakhs and rectified all the problems in my Halls. I purchased 4-250 LPH RO machines with the plan of centralising RO and 6 front-load washing machines worth 3 lakhs, which no other Halls had. I could do so only due to the Warden‚Äôs support, but it was based on only one condition, to regenerate the amount in my tenure. I took up the challenge and had all the spent money regenerated by renting common rooms to Festivals, residential rooms to ARs, and SPO for placement activity. After completing the challenge, I was motivated enough to contest for PSG in the upcoming elections. 5 candidates were rivals in doing so, but it was not something that gathered my attention. I was stuck up in my academics, and I had a CPI of around 6.67, which was not good in terms of placement.",
      "Around the same time, there was a significant issue of workers being fired from the water department. Many workers used to visit every known Hall president, asking them to help. I, along with the president of H-7(Sudama) & H-10(Parth), formed a strategy to reinstate them in the Institute. Consequently, PSG(Rohit) intervened and asked the DoIP/IWD to reinstate them. Due to contract issues, he could not intervene more, but he ensured those workers got jobs in different departments of IITK. This was the moment when I understood that we are not alone & we should always help the worker community because they are the ones who help students in dire need.",
      "12/12/22",
      "It was the day that changed my career here completely. Results of the 6th semester were out, and my current CPI was 6.51, just 0.01 above that for me to contest elections. I was already motivated enough to contest the election and didn‚Äôt care about the competition. I was thankful to Snehil, who motivated me well enough & made me realise my worth. But all of these expectations & desires ended when I met my senior Nirmal, who used to guide me on these matters. He advised me not to contest elections and scolded me, ‚ÄúYou have a lot of family disputes, low CPI, no preparation for placement, no intern for upcoming summers, and still you wish to accomplish everything. Also, your opponents have everything they need; what do you have?‚Äù. He advised me it‚Äôs better to give up this dream now and do something for which I came here. At first, I almost cried, but later, I understood what he meant, and it would benefit me in the future. Also, looking at the placement drive of Y‚Äô19s did scare me a lot.",
      "My network of friends was extensive. I had excellent relations with the PG community & workers community as well. As I had accomplished many feats during my tenure and people had already seen me working hard, many people asked me to contest, but I declined. I still remember the day when six Hall presidents and a few leaders of the workers‚Äô union asked me to contest & they assured me that they would support me. Eventually, all started asking what was the reason I was not taking part in the election, but I was unable to explain it to them at the core. Sometimes, silence is the best answer you can give.",
      "Freshers inferno was about to commence. Due to family problems, I was taking a long time to return to campus. Aman, Yatharth and Kaushal completely took responsibility for Freshers Inferno. With a lot of hard work and dedication, Marathas won the Freshers Inferno. It was a proud day for all of us.",
      "Now, the only thing that I needed to perform was the duty as the organiser of Ritambhara at Antaragni. If anyone asks me what is the best POR on campus, I would reply without hesitation that it‚Äôs an organiser in any Festival, preferably ‚ÄúAntaragni‚Äù.You get an enormous amount of exposure, bonding, and knowledge. After facing several challenges, we conducted Ritambhara at the main Auditorium after 3 years. It was a great experience which I would never forget. If you are an Organiser during those 4 days of Antaragni, the things you will see will never allow you to get demotivated & will give you enormous confidence to withstand anything in your life.",
      "Many students do fear interviews in Antaragni. The interviews of Antaragni, whether for the Heads or Organizer, are taken only to check the determination level, presence of mind, and the quality of pressure handling inside a person. It has no relation with what he knows or has accomplished earlier. So don‚Äôt fear and give it a try; the worst that can happen would be you would be asked to leave‚Ä¶.XD. Once the interview is over, you would feel that you are a liability to this world, but be strong; that check-up was to make sure you can handle any amount of pressure to commence in the future.",
      "With my Antaragni team, the best team to work with",
      "March‚Äô 23. This was the month when I contributed to IITK with my experience as Hall president. HMC meet was to be held after 3 years, & since I had a lot of experience in Hall affairs, I had proposed 2 proposals with the help of my Warden, one of which was approved by the committee as a dire need of the campus community. It was none other than the‚ÄúStandards Monetary Committee (SMC)‚Äù.¬† It was the only proposal approved by the HMC, whereas all other proposals were discarded or never floated.",
      "April 23. A lot of things were conducted simultaneously. Conduction of GC in just 10 days is not a joke. Even though the former Gymkhana tried their best, it will always result in the same. We won the inferno but felt cheated in Takneek. It was the main reason we took part in the impeachment of SNT Gen-sec, but kudos to them; they never showed up on the floor and saved themselves.The chairperson(Sanidhya) and I felt the need for a code of conduct for GC to avoid these situations.",
      "After summers, focusing on placement was not easy. There were a lot of issues going on with me. It is not easy to see your parents getting separated. Even after that, I had to hold them together and look after my placement preparation. I started doing some coding and clearing basics, but I was late in preparing them during the placement phase. When I look back, I question whether I really belonged to the wing where my closest friend was an ICPC finalist. Also, I was not so good in core as well. I was a great fit for APM roles & consulting, but a CPI of 6.34 doesn‚Äôt allow one to get even an interview in these roles.",
      "I had no opportunity on Day 1, which was valid since I never had such preparations. On day 2, I had only one interview in VVF, but it was in a core company, and I wasn‚Äôt a great fit there, so I already knew I didn‚Äôt stand a chance. On the night of day 2, I was broken as I didn‚Äôt see any hope of further shortlists, but at 4 am, I got a shortlist in 2 companies, Javis & Blitz. I had an interview in Javis around 12. Just after my interview, I got to know that no other student cleared round 1 & the company has visited campus just to maintain relations; the same kind of stuff had occurred in the past as well. After leaving there, I had one hour remaining for my blitz interview. I tried my best to get a walk-in interview at GLS, an oil-based company in Dubai. I was so involved in preparing for the interview with GLS and forgot about the interview at Blitz. I got rejected by GLS as they already had a lot of better candidates, but due to my mistake, I could not appear at the Blitz interview. When I reached the spot where the Blitz interview was taking place, I saw that my friends were having their HR round(round 3), looking at which I guessed I had no chance here.",
      "As my day worsened, I learned about IPAC and thought, why not try political consulting? I have a lot of experience in the political field. On the same night, with the help of my friends Siddharth and Animesh, I made the ppt and made a wonderful introduction video that would outstand 600+ applicants. On day 4, I had no interviews and was waiting for any company to open a walk-in, but luck was insufficient. The very same night, a few alumni who visited for hiring took me along with them to VH. We had a small party and interaction. They assured me they would help me if I did not benefit from campus placement but asked me to try hard until I could. No shortlist on day 5 made me realise I should start pulling all the strings I can. To my surprise, I finally met Snehil during placements. He also helped by giving a few alumni connections and referrals for this situation.",
      "Finally, I got shortlisted in IPAC for day 6. When I saw the shortlist‚Äôs order, I was pretty sure that it was their preferred hotlist, too. So I knew this was my chance and I should not miss it. Since I have always been doing the same election stuff on campus, I was confident that I would withstand the same. I cleared both rounds and got recruited as an Associate at IPAC. A special note, seniors and alums are always ready to help, but you just need to approach them humbly; god knows what magic can happen.",
      "Finally, they say whatever you do here pays you off, and I found it true. I was indeed very happy, and now I was free from all the burden. Jan ‚Äô24, it was election time, and this time, I was happy that finally, there was no one to stop me from getting involved. I was happy that all of my preferred candidates took my advice, and they won their respective positions. I felt it was an internship for my job profile. Also, there are a lot of loopholes in the code of conduct that can be overcome easily. Hence, candidates can work together(collusion), but they should know how to save themselves. A tip for future candidates: no one can stop you from winning the elections if you have the support of the workers‚Äô community. Also, remember,‚ÄúNo elections are fair; you need to struggle and win it, no matter what it takes‚Äù.",
      "Defines your win in an almost-lost battle",
      "At last, being a 4th-year senior, I preferred not to be involved in Galaxy, but in the end, when 3 pool captains & former pool caps met me and told me about unfair conduct they faced, it was sufficient enough to convince me that they were at the vulnerable side and should be helped. I started planning on scrapping the Galaxy 7 days before the PCR was to be presented on the floor. Indeed, we did have only 8 senators in support, and making a majority was very challenging, but making the numbers up was my task, and I knew how to do the same. Even though the outgoing Gymkhana had a majority of senators who favoured current position holders, making it to the majority was not simple. At last, I got my task done with the plan. Believe me, it was such a well-devised plan that the loophole to the plan was known only to a few people, and I guess neither Gymkhana nor the Senate ever knew about it. At last, everything worked out as planned, and we finally scrapped the Galaxy.",
      "I faced much criticism and hate towards me, which I accepted happily. Among all the allegations, I did feel for one allegation: you could never see girls win the Galaxy, and you took it from us. I assure you, I was the happiest person when girls proved that they were better than boys, but petty politics towards the ranking of GC made me realise that getting emotional is not the way. I was ready, and I am ready to accept all the hate that comes with it.¬† My beginning of college life was in the very same situation, so it never bothered me.",
      "At last, leaving my goa trip with the boys, I visited my family to end the conflicts, but I guess I was too late. Things had escalated towards the divorce of my parents, and I could no longer hold them. It is very disturbing to see this situation where your mother cries in your arms, and there is nothing you can do other than console her. I guess this is what life is. You can never predict what‚Äôs up next.",
      "After returning to campus, I was on my last task to end it here. I had proposed a no-confidence motion for the upcoming chairperson and got it done the way it is. The GBM should understand that the leaders leading them should be clean and have no political plans involved. I am proud that I got an opportunity to set an example that no one is above law and order. Also, I want everyone to know you are precious as a GBM with no position. Believe me, you can do whatever you wish if your will is strong enough.",
      "‚ÄúNo need to be ‚ÄòSG‚Äô when you can be Godfather‚Äù- A famous Y‚Äô13",
      "April 16, 2024: I got the news of the UPSC exam results and called Mohit to congratulate him on his feat. He cleared his first attempt at the UPSC exam with AIR-192, and guess what? He is an IPS officer now. I say life is very unpredictable, and one never gets to know the beauty of it. A student who got disciplinary action against him in SSAC, a student who lost his mother during UPSC preparation, cleared one of the toughest exams of the world and is esteemed to get a white collared job. Just imagine his state of mind during those times.",
      "I used to have a lot of arguments with another senior, and I literally hated her earlier. It was none other than EC-CEO Samiksha. However, my perspective on her changed when I learned what she was going through while teaching at Prayas IITK. She literally fought with everyone when she was opposed by her family and close friends to help someone out of hand. She was helping a girl financially who had lost her family, and she supported her to become an independent, strong woman.",
      "This is the kind of personality that IITK develops, and according to me, it is best to go with the flow and do whatever you wish to do. Just do not waste your time in your hostels; instead, spend it with friends to live your 4 years here. Participate anywhere you wish; there is a lot to try at IITK. Also, there is a lot of community service that you can deliver, and you don‚Äôt need to hold any post to give it. It‚Äôs all upon you.",
      "There are a lot of seniors on our campus who inspire us but never follow anyone blindly. Finally, it‚Äôs your call for what you shall be, so think, analyse, and act. We all have problems in life but remember that these problems are the ones that make you strong.",
      "Some wins from almost- lost leagues at IITK",
      "Lastly, I would say to learn to respect yourself first. If you learn to do so, you will achieve whatever you want to. Also, you are the only one who can help yourself out when no one else can. Take care.",

      "In this 5th edition of As We Leave, Shrey Mehta, a graduating Y20 student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, shares his rollercoaster journey of college with his friends. Read his story of navigating different stages with enjoyment.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It‚Äôs that time of life where I am filled with a plethora of emotions, obviously the sadness of leaving this beautiful campus and the life here, along with the excitement of moving forward into a new world altogether. This stunning journey started on the 18th of November, 2020, and life has turned a full circle since then. Many friends made, uncountable incredible moments experienced with them, and memories made for a lifetime are my takeaways from this journey.",
      "It has been a rollercoaster of a ride, starting with the covid times when my entire life took the online route (too disappointed to date to miss those 1.5 years), taking a huge exciting leap on coming back to the campus and now comes the time when it‚Äôs about to leave. Though life may not have always been good, with the rollercoaster going to great heights and sometimes to some steep lows, the journey has been remarkable.",
      "I don‚Äôt know how many of you have watched the film Student of the Year, but at least I was impressed with one of its dialogues a lot, and I feel it holds in real life as well: ‚ÄúDost to sabhi ke hote hai, par school, college ke dosto ki baat hi kuch aur hoti hai. Ma baap ki tarah hume samajhte hai wo dost, jante hai wo dost. Takraar, jalan, competition, chahe kisi bhi daur se guzar jaaye ye dosti, dil pe uska koi asar nahi hota. Hum ye dosti kabhi nahi todenge.‚Äù I have grown up fantasizing about this very definition of friendship.",
      "When I was in school, I was that typical nerd kind of guy who was friends with nobody (which, obviously, I will regret for the rest of my life) and wanted to achieve everything in his life. So, entering this whole new, highly romanticized place, I had no friends and wanted to make many of them who would last a lifetime. But, little did I know that this dream would extend even further for 1.5 years as covid struck and in the online mode of conduction, I was too introverted to start a conversation with anyone and eventually, ended up with very few friends (Het and Kushal, that also because they were also from Ahmedabad and I had met them, along with few others in the meets held there). After that came the dream day, 29th December 2021, when I stepped into the world of my imagination for the first time. However, things didn‚Äôt start well, as people enjoyed the first day and 31st of December with their wings and friends while I sat in my room and tried to pass the days first so I could settle down and adjust to this new world.",
      "Luckily, life flipped this script on my birthday, the 6th of January, which was the first one on campus of the people I know to date back then. I was expecting to sleep, with calls from my parents, but to my surprise, I had a knock on the door at 11:58 pm, and there was the entire Ahmedabad gang, along with two more wings of Kushal, Akshunya and Jasjot, who went on to become one of my best friends till date. That day marked the beginning of this beautiful journey I am about to narrate.",
      "So, the next day, I threw a party for all of these peeps and was invited to Akshunya‚Äôs birthday later that month. Slowly, the bond developed between me, Kushal, Akshunya and Jasjot. Then I joined the group we named ‚Äúasdfg‚Äù (Too lazy to form names, so took the first five letters of the keyboard), which consisted of one more exciting member, Samar. Chalo to now, I was at a stage where I got some boost or, say, some part of the imagination of what I wanted.",
      "Then, the 2nd and 3rd years went by, and in the process, some new friends were made; many moments were cherished initially in Hall 12 with some other good friends like Mohit, Akhil and many others, and later in Hall 5 as sort of pseudo-wingie of the ‚Äúasdfg‚Äù group. Notably, for even many Y20s also don‚Äôt know, I am from Hall 2 but would be seen in Hall 5 the entire day with these people, and yes, there‚Äôs a little secret to it too: I have eaten in Hall 5 mess for almost two years, and till today, the mess wale bhaiya thinks that I was of Hall 5 itself. We would be doing nearly everything together, be it playing sports or doing assignments or doingbakchodithe entire day.",
      "I also met Aryan in Hall 5, and we became good friends then. One fine day, I was working in the KD library with some assignment and fell asleep when Jaya woke me up and asked for something, to which I replied, ‚ÄúHein??‚Äù. This was my first one-to-one interaction with her, and ended up adding a whole new chapter to my life. So, along with my other friends, Aryan and Jaya (who in turn knew each other also well) became two of my newest friends, remaining amongst the best to date. With these two and Harshit, the trio became one more group of my friends, adding to the existing ones, and eventually turned out to be one of the best of them.",
      "But, as they say, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant in life‚Äù; things didn‚Äôt remain the same forever. In the final year, some of my friends and I moved to Hall 1, during which some of them were left behind in Hall 9 (though they are still in touch more than anyone else). Also, priorities for some of them changed, and I learnt a crucial lesson in my life, ‚ÄúTreat the people the way they treat you‚Äù (though the actual quote states otherwise). Regardless of the situation, I tried to balance things between all my friends and spend as much time as possible with them during this last leap of the journey. But, the dialogue from YJHD suits the best here, where Naina says, ‚ÄúLife me kitna bhi try karlo, kuch na kuch toh chootega hi. To jaha hai wahi ke maze lete hai‚Äù. So, over this last lap, majorly the entire 8th semester, I spent time roaming around, going out for trips, and enjoying time with my friends. At this point, I feel fortunate to have had such great, loving and understanding friends throughout this rollercoaster ride.",
      "College life is to explore, and one should dig into each direction to find out which suits one. The best way to do so and to engage with the seniors and even the batchmates is to be a part of some club or society.",
      "One of the biggest regrets of my college life is not being a part of any club or team, which was mainly due to the entire first year being online, which was due to me not being aware of the importance of joining them and the help they provide in the character development of a person. Though last year mein was a part of the Google Developer Student Club; in its first tenure at IITK, I realised what I had missed throughout my three years. It gives you a great chance to interact with many people on campus, including seniors, batchmates and even the junior batches. Besides that, I got a chance to become a Tutor for ESC101 and ESO207, where I got an excellent opportunity to interact with the junior batches and fulfil all I had missed in my previous years here.",
      "Along with that, the best social interaction happens in the wings of the hostels. I might not have interacted much with my wing in Hall 2, but I was a pseudo-wingie of the Hall 5 group, which helped me interact and learn. I went through the phase of being a complete introvert in the first year (before coming to campus) and not being involved anywhere; I have come out as one of the guys known by almost everyone in the CSE Department, at least the Y20 batch. People who didn‚Äôt even know me back then now tell me, ‚ÄúTujhe to sab jante hi honge‚Äù. This has been a significant turnaround in my life, and I feel that interacting with my peers and seniors by getting involved in some place helped me survive this captivating journey through college.",
      "Full-time bakchodi karna is a part of almost everyone‚Äôs campus life. My parents tell me I have changed a lot after college. I have been playing all day round, studying only the last days of the exam or doing all-nighters to complete the assignment. They ask me, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you start it on time?‚Äù My answer is, ‚ÄúAre koi nahi karta itna jaldi start idhar!‚Äù. This is the academic life summarised here on campus.",
      "To my utter disappointment, I started my campus life in an online mode, due to covid, all of you know. Since I was also more of an introvert then, I focused on studying, which people here call ‚ÄúJEE Mode‚Äù. This way, I completed my three semesters here with a decent CPI of 9.8 (B bhi aise courses me laga tha jisme sabse jyada cheating hui online me). Then, a bomb dropped. I came to campus in the fourth semester, and boom, my SPI dropped to 8.8 that semester. Coming back on campus after such a long wait and having already missed three semesters hit, and then what? Wo pura sem bakchodi me nikal diya! It was evident when the results came through, and little did I know about the importance of CPI during the internship season, which would take place at the start of the very next semester. I had no chance to increase it, so I started focussing on other things: learning DSA, Quant prep, etc.",
      "Then came the D-Day, the Day 1 of the internship season. After having cleared rounds for companies, I had 5-6 interviews on Day 1. I don‚Äôt know what happened that day; I lost my opportunity to get into two of my top preference companies, and even after completing the rounds of the other companies, I was wondering whether I was getting an offer that day. That day, even my SPO friends would not respond as they were also busy managing the other interviews, and the day passed. It was night, I had not eaten anything the entire day, and I was very ashamed of myself, thinking, ‚ÄúKya muh dikhaunga ghar pe‚Äù. I generally talk to my parents over the phone daily, but that day, I was out of any confidence to speak to them. My friends took me to Hall 11 for dinner; I was almost teary-eyed and didn‚Äôt sleep at all that night with all the weird thoughts running through my head. Then, the next morning, came that call from Garvit (one of my colleagues at Samsung), who said that I had been selected for an internship there. I was literally out of words, my eyes filled with uncontainable delight, and I called my Mom and said, ‚ÄúHo gaya Samsung me!‚Äù That was the most satisfying moment of my life. Luckily, I got a PPO from there, so I did not have to sit for the placement season, as I was in no mood to go over that stress and pressure again.",
      "‚ÄúFir to kya, karo maze, ab to life sorted hai‚Äù was my only motto during the last two semesters. Besides maintaining a decent CPI and doing some valuable projects, I managed to enjoy and be a part of all the things that I had missed or did not get a chance to get into due to covid or several other reasons.",
      "This academic expedition has seen many ups and one major down, but it has also been meaningful and memorable to cherish.",
      "A very serious rule of my life, which I tell everyone and abide by, is ‚ÄúKabhi kisi bhi trip ke liye mana nahi karna chahiye.‚Äù Why does anyone say no to a trip? Padhai karni hai (ye to nahi ho raha), paise nahi hai (intern me itna to kamaya hai) and the worst of the reasons I get from my friends, ‚ÄúMan nahi hai‚Äù. What does it take to go on a trip with friends? An impromptu plan and a bunch of friends ready to follow that plan with you. My first trip was with the aforementioned ‚Äúasdfg‚Äù group, where we went to Jaisalmer in the mid-semester break of the fourth semester (bola tha na bohot bakchodi kari hai tab). I went on another trip with them and a few more of them to Thailand, a dream trip for most of us and one of the most discussed ones on the campus. Even one of my neighbouring flightmate was surprised that we had gotten a chance to visit Thailand during our college days itself. It was one of the best trips of my life till now, and we enjoyed it in all sorts (waisa sab kuch nahi kiya) there and utilized our last vacation to the best of our ability. Besides that, trips help strengthen the bonds between the friends as they live, talk and play with each other the entire day. I went to Rishikesh with Kushal, Het and Arpit in December of last year to do all sorts of adventurous activities possible, where we also did bungee jumping. Also, the trip to Varanasi was very memorable as we seven people shared the same dormitory and enjoyed ourselves with each other the whole night. It was a new group of friends for me, which I joined later, and I had a chance to make friends with many new friends and interact with them to date. One to Lucknow was sort of a road trip vibing on old 1990s Bollywood songs. I explored Lucknow‚Äôs traditional local cuisines and fashion with one of my favourite travel groups comprising Aryan, Jaya and Harshit, along with Priya. I expect to share a seat on many more trips with them and my ‚Äúasdfg‚Äù group.",
      "Another important stress buster was the fests, especially Techkriti and Antaragni. They came twice a year, and those 4-5 days would be filled with fun, vibe and whatnot. Dancing in the fests and ultimately matching the vibe was the prime motto of Akshunya, Mohit and me, who used to dance the night out on the days of the concert. Also, the campus used to feel new and filled with lots of novelty, with many people visiting the campus during that time. These nights will be one of the most memorable moments of my campus life.",
      "Many memories were cherished, and nostalgic moments were captured through these beautiful and captivating fests and the stunning trips through these four years.",
      "To Kushal, for being the constant supporter and ever-ready for any plan. To Akshunya, for always understanding me and encouraging me. To Aryan, for that late night walks and showing the practical route of every situation. To Jaya, for all the gossip sessions and the fantastic trips planned. To Harshit, for constant FOMO to learn more. To Samar, for the exciting cricket matches played and watched.To Akhil, Harsh and Mohit, for being the constant poker buddies (the best one was that night we played poker in the RM building).To Jasjot, for the late-night parties had. To Dishay, for the valuable mental support provided at the deadline of the assignments. To Tejas, for giving me your priceless relationship advice and carrying the bag to all places to help all keep their stuff. To Vaidik, for those enlightening conversations. To Het, for teaching me a carefree attitude. To Arpit, for a boost of completing the assignments a minute before the deadline. To Garvit, for helping me out of crunch situations.",
      "As I prepare to depart from this beautiful loop of things, I‚Äôll treasure these memories as the foundation for the exciting path that awaits me but, as SRK says, ‚ÄúPicture abhi baaki hai mere Dost‚Äù with many more memories to cherish with these wonderful people going further. Sadly, IITK won‚Äôt be there then with us.",

      "Readers are highly encouraged to play the ‚Äúaudiobook‚Äù as they read because:",
      "It is 5:15 AM on May 6th, 2024, and as I see the sky lighten and grow yellow-gold, and my friends in various stages of sleep being bumped around by the hastily-booked Vikram auto that is taking us to Bithoor for my first visit in 2.5 years of living in Kanpur, I start to write the intro to this AWL in my head.",
      "And then I decide it is too complicated.",
      "Hi! For any stranger who has somehow arrived here, I‚Äôm Janhvi. Or Jahnvi, depending on your persuasion. I‚Äôm a recently graduated Computer Science and Engineering student from this obscure li‚Äôl place called IITK. You may have seen me roaming around with my hall 2 boys (Aditya, Akhil, Soham), grabbing candies from any nearby canteen, or always sitting alone in the H6 mess. Or you may have seen me running around for some Gender Cell work, at a Book Club event, or sitting in the senate hall alternately trying to talk sense and enjoying the ‚ú®drama‚ú®.",
      "Aditya ke teen dost (Soham, me & Akhil)",
      "Or you may have never seen me. After all, this campus is big enough for the both of us. And if I am to talk about the time I‚Äôve spent here, I will have to talk about who I was before. So bear with me.",
      "PFA my bio-data: funny lil fat kid, good at academics, bold and loud and sometimes mean. And then I ‚Äúchose‚Äù JEE because my options were that or NEET, and I didn‚Äôt want to repeat what my sister had done. I spent almost two years of my life studying daily at my coaching for 12 hours straight (do not call me a Maggu‚Ñ¢), and then six months of lockdown exclusively reading questionable fanfiction off of questionable websites. This included not touching a single textbook or quiz or talking to a single teacher or peer from the coaching or elsewhere.",
      "It was quiet, it was lonely, and like many other people, I was incredibly lost. Instead of going back to my ‚Äúshell‚Äù, I kind of barrelled straight into a cell and chose to not even peep out.",
      "Dark, dark times. Dark like a gulab jamun",
      "Thank all the gods for C*vid ending. And thank God for IITK.Our first semester was such a confusing experience. I‚Äôd been on the internet for years at that point, but only to watch or read or listen and never to interact with a real new person, a real stranger. Youtubers or authors or musicians didn‚Äôt prepare me for the alarm I felt when I saw Girik Maskara‚Äôs innocent text asking me if I wanted to be added to the department group. (I ended up going to my first college trip with him and some other friends). Oh well, you live and learn.",
      "On 18th November 2020, I attended my first ‚Äúclass‚Äù. On the 25th, I joined Prayas which remained with me throughout college. On the 29th, I started talking to the person who soon became my absolute best friend. These people became more real to me than most people around, and it was mind blowing that we had never even met properly.",
      "Aditya (the best friend)(our first time outside campus, and one of our last events in campus)",
      "It was not all hunky-dory though. My weird style of not texting back for days at a time was naturally not to everyone‚Äôs tastes. I found people (like Akanksha) who I instantly connected with but we just couldn‚Äôt deal with each other online. I found her again slowly, very slowly, after coming to campus. On the other side, I lost friendships that worked beautifully online but we were just too different in the real world.",
      "I met Shivangi when she had a boy cut and was dressed up as Percy Jackson. I met Raaghav because of an embarrassing misunderstanding where I may have come across as an anti-vaxxer.",
      "Raaghav, who can now certify I‚Äôm not a facebook-level boomer",
      "The point of all of this is to tell you how bizarre it was. But also to say I‚Äôm so grateful for these people. Because while we were making friends, we were also dealing with online classes, online labs, online discussions where no one speaks and we all just stare at the TA, or worse, one dumbass classmate keeps talking and talking and you can‚Äôt lamp him on the head for it because you promised to be a nonviolent person and also because, you know, you live hundreds of miles away. A touch-starved, emotionally starved, pent up generation of children trying to breathe fresh air in the same four-walled rooms.",
      "But like I said, thank God for IITK.",
      "Because campus was the freshest breath of air I‚Äôd ever taken, the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever seen, the most free I (and most of us) have ever been.",
      "Learning to ride a cycle with no hands. Do not repeat this stunt at home",
      "I realise that most of this is about the journey to IITK and not in IITK, but I cannot sit here and summarise in a few hundred words how important the last two and a half years have been. You grow in this place more than anywhere else, you learn how to be a person, have a thought process, and have principles of your own. You learn how stupid you are (I will not even exemplify this because I was so embarrassingly stupid) and how smart you can be (I got an A in Suchitra ma‚Äôam‚Äôs course). You learn how to juggle academics with your interests and your relationships and your responsibilities. You learn how it feels to break down under immense pressure (6th sem, f*cking Compilers) and then whom to approach who will tell you to get your shit together (thank you, Jiya) and, again, breathe, babygirl.",
      "With Gaurav (co-coordinator), Jiya (ex-coordinator & boss extraordinaire) at the Book Club",
      "You can never see it coming because it‚Äôll always find ways to surprise you. I‚Äôm a Book Club person, so I‚Äôll tell you a story: once upon a time, this girl was having a really really terrible semester. Meanwhile, her 21st birthday was coming up. She develops a fear that the days before the birthday will remain really depressing, the day of the birthday will be a false hope of seemingly incoming happiness, of having only one good day. And that the days after the birthday will go back to their usual depressing programming.Dear reader, the good day never came. It was all continuously crap.",
      "Solution? Find people like Shivangi, who will stick by you in every sad funk",
      "Not to say that IITK doesn‚Äôt surprise you pleasantly. I have met the most wonderful people through the Book Club and had the nerdiest possible discussions with them. Through Gender Cell, I have sometimes met people having the crappiest time of their life, but they have all been so resilient, so very brave. And if you look beyond us loud undergrads, you will find brilliant PhD folks, who are, at the end of the day, just like us. You will find incredibly sweet and hardworking SIS guard didis and bhaiyas, or the didi who cleans your room, or the bhaiya who works in your mess. If you talk to them, you will realise that our campus is an entire system, separate from the city but existing in the same unequal world. There are charms in IITK you can find nowhere else, true, but our system sometimes fails some of our residents spectacularly.",
      "While it may not be your duty as a student, it is only by engaging with more than just academics or PoRs that we can be part of the community of this vivid place.",

      "The campus is chock-full of interesting, funny and kind people. There are almost 10000 of us students in 1024 acres, and trust me, if you haven‚Äôt met your kind yet, keep looking. Trust that our campus does not disappoint. I met someone at the end of 5th semester and they are so cool and they like me and it‚Äôs awesome. I met someone I‚Äôd known since the 4th semester, but only started talking to them in the 8th and they are so cool and they like me and it‚Äôs awesome. I met several someones in the last 3 days as I write this and they are so cool and they seem to like me and it‚Äôs goddamn awesome. And it is so unfair that we have to leave.",

      "In this 3rd edition of As We Leave, Shreyansh Agarwal, a graduating Y20 student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, shares his transformative journey through college. Read his story of navigating different stages of college life, differently but happily.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As I stand on the brink of my graduation and reflect on the past four years (well, technically 3.5, thanks to our cursed batch!),I can‚Äôt help but notice how much has changed from then till now. College has been a place where I have truly discovered myself ‚Äì figuring out what I like, embracing my values, finding my tribe, and stumbling upon some unexpected adventures along the way. My story isn‚Äôt just about passing semesters; it‚Äôs about the ‚Äú5 mistakes of my college life (according to ‚Äòthem‚Äô) that changed my life‚Äù Those missteps, often seen as the ‚Äúroad not taken,‚Äù actually shaped my journey and led me right here, typing away on a Google Doc with a big smile on my face. So, bear with me as we dive in!",
      "Cars have always captivated me, and they were my very first love (I might have declared my affection for them even before saying ‚Äúma‚Äù or ‚Äúpa‚Äù). They played a big part in why I chose Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur to kick off my journey. Things began with some pretty dull orientation sessions (more like lectures, less like fun, especially since they were virtual), followed by introductions to Gymkhana events, clubs, and all the usual first-month rituals.",
      "It was during one of those departmentalbulla sessionsin the first week of my ‚Äúonline college‚Äù that reality hit me hard: Mechanical Engineering wasn‚Äôt exactly about building actual cars; it was more about studying principles of thermodynamics and heat transfer. The real engineering happened in the garage of IITK Motorsports, which I cannot explore in this remote setting üò£.",
      "I was pretty bummed out by my hasty decision, and my dislike for the department grew when I learned about the branch hierarchy at IIT Kanpur, which could potentially mess up my future career. This realisation kickstarted the first gear of my college life with one simple goal:to change my branch.",
      "Getting a branch change turned out to be relatively easy during an online semester, thanks to all the tools at our disposal (except ChatGPT, unfortunately). I made sure to attend all my lectures by the weekend (yes, we had the luxury of missing classes and catching up on weekends at double speed), completed all my assignments diligently, and cleared my doubts with professors during the sessions. Basically, I did everything possible to maintain a high CPI. Just to clarify, I wasn‚Äôt exactly amaggu; more on that later in my essay.",
      "This phase of my college life taught me about perseverance and the consequences of skipping lectures (which I learned the hard way for the remaining 75% of my college life üòÇ). I ended my first semester with a 9.8 CPI and the second with a 9.6, ultimately landing me in the world of bulbs and tube lights. The Electrical Engineering department wasn‚Äôt exactly a fairyland, but it fit me better. I enjoyed maths and circuits (before EE210 came and ruined that interest). Most of the friends I made (virtually) in my first year were from the Batti department itself (somehow), so transitioning wasn‚Äôt too difficult.",
      "The only way we could celebrate it in an online semester",
      "According to ‚Äúthem‚Äù, being studious in the first year counts as a mistake because this period is supposed to be enjoyable, but they never really define what enjoyment means. In an online semester, the peak of enjoyment was hanging out with friends (whom I hadn‚Äôt met yet) on a video call, listening to music, making jokes, watching movies together, or just chatting about random stuff. I did all of that, but I also took advantage of the online mode to boost my CPI and safeguard my future years from any potential setbacks (if that‚Äôs what a disastrous semester means to you). Looking back, I realise that spending most of my time on academics wasn‚Äôt a mistake after all. During that time, books were my best buddies (the only time xD), and good grades brought me joy. Things changed drastically later, but I‚Äôm grateful I put in the hard work at least once during my engineering degree.",
      "I have always been a bit of an oddball, you see. Finding ‚Äúmy people‚Äù has been a bit of a quest for me, and it seems like I always end up wandering outside of my usual circles. Back in Mechanical Engineering, I had hardly any friends in my department but plenty in every other department. And when it came to living in Hall 5, well, let‚Äôs say my friends were mainly from Hall 12 and 3, not so much in Hall 5 itself. Even when I was leading a group, I found myself bonding more with other club leaders than with my own club members. It was a strange pattern, but it somehow worked out well for me.",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äù always say you should have your closest friends in your own wing because they are the closest to you. Well, for me, it was quite the opposite. My go-to buddies were from a completely different hall, which made things a bit complicated. Because of this, it was tough to find people with similar interests and mindsets, especially since there were so many people in my batch to choose from. And things got even trickier when we finally returned to college after 1.5 years of online semesters. By then, most people had already formed their own groups, and it felt nearly impossible to break into them out of the blue. So, I stuck to a small circle of friends.",
      "At one point, my circle was so tiny it was practically just a ‚Äòdot‚Äô. But I believed in destiny and kept talking to new people, hanging out with friends of friends, and slowly but surely, things started to change. It took me 2 whole years of college to find a stable group of people I could trust and share everything without any filters. Surprisingly, I found them through random interactions and course meetups. My philosophy was simple: I didn‚Äôt want to settle for surface-level friendships just because I lived with certain people or was in the same department. I wanted friends with whom I could be completely myself and truly understand me from the inside out. While I understand the importance of compromise in fostering good friendships, I also firmly believe that great friendships are formed when there‚Äôs an instant connection and mutual understanding, without anyone feeling pressured to settle for something they are not entirely comfortable with. True friends are like reflections of ourselves; finding them might take time and be unpredictable, but it‚Äôs certainly worth it when you find that perfect match. Don‚Äôt settle for less than you deserve. Always strive to find your own tribe, even if they may not all be part of the same close-knit group.",
      "The‚Äúdot‚Äùthat saw all phases of friendship together at a time",
      "Thankfully, after all these years, I can proudly say that I have had people who have been there for me through thick and thin. Apart from celebrating birthdays and special occasions together, we also went through the lows of 19th November 2023 (for those who know, there was an event in Ahmedabad that trashed a million hearts) and celebrated the joy of 22nd January 2024 (after a wait of 500 years lol) together. This is what I gained from my friendships at IIT Kanpur ‚Äì pure, unfiltered love.",
      "My ‚Äútribe‚Äùthat stayed, through thick and thin, from academics to outings, everywhere",
      "Since I am talking about friendships, I also want to touch upon a belief of mine that ‚Äúthey‚Äù questioned a lot. I have always stood by the principle of treating everyone with equal respect, regardless of their seniority or juniority. It‚Äôs important to recognize that bothseniors and juniors are human beings, first and foremost, AS SIMPLE AS THAT!While seniors offer valuable experience to learn from, juniors possess an inherent eagerness to be moulded and guided towards excellence. This might seem strange in a college setting (and for that fact, IIT Kanpur is no exception), where there‚Äôs often a hierarchy between batches ‚Äì seniors act all superior. At the same time, juniors usually feel like they‚Äôre just not as important. But I think it‚Äôs essential for everyone to interact and get to know each other. I acknowledge that the initial phase of ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù, even if mildly challenging, somehow contributes to personal growth. Once that initial awkwardness subsides, the divide between different batches should diminish to the point where individuals, whether seniors or juniors, feel comfortable initiating conversations and forming real, meaningful bonds rather than limiting it to exchanging alcohol and cigarettes.",
      "Apparently, I made some really awesome friends with my junior batchmates, and hanging out with them was just as fun as hanging out with my own batchmates. We all bonded over shared interests without any ulterior motives. But sadly, not everyone sees it that way. Even at places like IIT, it almost feels like talking to a junior is a crime, and hanging out with them is even worse! I got a lot of flak for my behaviour, even from some of my close friends. But somehow, I didn‚Äôt let it bother me. My juniors respected me, and that‚Äôs all that mattered. I will keep emphasising it until you get bored of it, but ‚Äúfind your tribe‚Äú, and this tribe shouldn‚Äôt be limited to just your own batchmates.",
      "My people, who worked with me, laughed and cried with me, and respected me",
      "The best part was that my closest friends never questioned me about it. They knew there was nothing wrong with treating everyone equally. I had some awesome senior friends, too. All I ever wanted was to replicate that same kind of friendship with my junior batch. So whether we were working together or just chilling at CCD, I always treated everyone with the same respect and love, no matter which batch they were from.",
      "So, for those reading this, my advice is to choose your friends wisely and never take those friendships for granted. They are some of the most precious gems you‚Äôll ever find in your life. And if you relate to my story, don‚Äôt let things like age, batch, or petty things like a hall of residence define who your friends should be. Go out there and find ‚Äúyour people.‚Äù Trust me, you‚Äôll have the time of your life. I have partied in clubs, planned impromptu trips (more of it in next section), gone to MotoGP races, screamed my throat out in the CWC ‚Äô23 India-England match in the stadium, danced at fests, hung out in cafes, taken long walks around campus ‚Äì all with ‚Äúmy people,‚Äù who come from all ages and batches. And you know what? We have never had a problem with it. It‚Äôs been nothing but sweet and fun.",
      "‚ÄúThe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.‚Äú",
      "‚ÄìConfucius",
      "Travelling is my ultimate therapy, and I have always craved new experiences. IIT Kanpur gave me the freedom to wander, friends to join me, and the chance to explore beyond its gates. While I cherished the places within the campus, I believed that the world outside, even just beyond the main gate, was waiting to be discovered. Kanpur, a place we may not revisit for a long time, deserves to be fully explored. And why stop at Kanpur? Why not nearby places and beyond?",
      "As soon as the COVID restrictions eased and we came to campus for the first time (around December 29, 2021), I found myself itching to break free from the monotony of campus life. Within just three days, I grew bored of the same old routine, so I decided to venture out and explore the eateries near the front gate. From that moment on, there was no looking back. I spent my fourth-semester exploring malls and cafes in the heart of Kanpur City. During my second-year summers, every weekend was an opportunity to discover a new fine dining restaurant or cafe with different groups of friends.",
      "But the real turning point came when I met my best friend at IIT Kanpur, someone who shared my passion for travel. We were both shortlisted for Bain & Co.‚Äôs interview rounds and were invited to a networking dinner event at their Gurgaon office. That trip to Delhi was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Our first adventure as a duo was a meticulously planned trip to Agra during the mid-semester break of our fifth semester. It was fun, luxurious and smooth, but it also included my first experience of missing a train ‚Äì a memorable mishap, to say the least!",
      "This is how it started from Bain and Co. dinner",
      "From there, our travels only grew more adventurous. We embarked on group trips to Varanasi, Delhi, Lonavla, and Mumbai, each filled with laughter, exploration, and unforgettable memories. Lucknow became our go-to weekend getaway, and we often decided on a whim to explore the city at the crack of dawn. As time passed, our hangout spots evolved, from the rooftop of the IITK faculty building to the rooftop bar of Hotel Renaissance in Lucknow.",
      "By our fourth year, we were executing long-distance trips to places like Guwahati, Diu, Pondicherry, Goa, Kovalam, and Rameswaram, along with countless short trips practically every other weekend. Now, you might wonder how we afforded all these trips. It‚Äôs simple ‚Äìsave or earn it, and plan it out. Once you start travelling, you‚Äôll discover countless ways to explore without breaking the bank. Begin by setting aside a portion of your monthly pocket money, or consider taking on internships to earn extra cash. Invest wisely, build up your capital, and then see the world.Life is too short to stay in one place, repeating the same routine day after day.These college years are precious, and the friendships you make during this time are invaluable. There‚Äôs a unique energy to travelling with grounded friends, experiencing the world together while still navigating the challenges of youth (often termed ‚Äúduniyadari seekhna‚Äù by our parents). College may provide knowledge from textbooks and presentations, but true understanding comes from stepping out into the world and experiencing it firsthand.",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äù might call it a mistake, thinking college life is confined to the walls of IIT Kanpur. Step out of your comfort zone, take a long bicycle ride to the Ganga barrage one day, and plan a similar excursion to Bithoor the following weekend. Upgrade your mode of transportation from a bicycle to something more practical yet affordable, and embark on journeys spanning hundreds and eventually thousands of kilometres. The spectrum is pretty broad, from organising a budget-friendly three-day, 500-kilometre round trip for less than INR 600 per person to splurging over 20,000 INR for a rejuvenating getaway at a 5-star property. Each journey, whether modest or grand, economical or luxurious, offers invaluable lessons. And it all begins with a single bicycle ride.",

      "My philosophy is straightforward: I want stories to share with my children beyond the routine campus spots. So, make the most of your college years ‚Äì travel, explore, and create memories that will last a lifetime. Develop the confidence to step out and experience the genuine world beyond the confines of social media.

      "Let‚Äôs delve into the Gymkhana and related activities, where I truly grew as an individual. It all kicked off with an Adobe Photoshop workshop organised by the DnA club during our first online semester, igniting my passion for digital design. I have always had a knack for art, recalling my creative imagination on the walls of my childhood home. This inherent interest resurfaced after about a decade through this workshop, further fueled by delving into Adobe Illustrator. I found myself constantly exploring new features of these applications, dedicating 5-6 hours daily to creating caricatures, cartoons, and other creative ventures. This not only balanced out my studious side in the first year but also garnered recognition for my efforts to enhance the Design and Animation club‚Äôs profile. That‚Äôs how I utilised my ‚Äòme time‚Äô during the first year: business dealing through E-Cell and dabbling in the Astro club, exploring my cosmic interests ‚Äì a notably enriching experience guided by a phenomenal senior mentor.",
      "My second year was marked by a flurry of Positions of Responsibility (PORs), as I had already pushed myself academically in the previous year. Consequently, I took on six roles in my sophomore year, from organising fests to serving as the MnC and SnT secretaries, SPO Coco, and being part of the web team of Counseling Services. This shift led to a slight dip in my CPI, but my focus had shifted away from academic pursuits by then. Juggling multiple responsibilities became challenging, with deadlines always looming close by. My approach to taking on PORs was driven by a desire to learn and grow personally rather than merely for the sake of titles, which added an extra layer of pressure. The transition to on-campus activities in the fourth semester further intensified the workload, as we spent those three months making up for lost time from the virtual semesters ‚Äì a trend observed across various clubs, including those I was involved in.",
      "Then came one of the best decisions of my college life ‚Äì a seemingly random decision to participate in a high-prep Inter IIT Tech Meet problem statement competition centred around reducing carbon footprints and building sustainable supply chains. This experience, shared with a team comprising members from different batches, was a whirlwind of learning, laughter, and camaraderie. Our collective efforts culminated in winning the only gold medal of that time in the Inter IIT High Prep Problem Statement category, surpassing even the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù IIT Kharagpur by a significant margin. The memories of those two months, filled with intense energy, late-night poker games, and shared triumphs, remain etched in my mind as an irreplaceable experience. The individuals I collaborated with during this time are among the sweetest souls I have had the pleasure of knowing, with the seniors who led us to become invaluable mentors and go-to people, each one of them being an inspiration.",
      "The unbeatable team @ Blueyonders, Inter IIT Tech Meet 2022",
      "This event paved the way for me to consider taking on the leadership of ICG, the institute‚Äôs consulting group. The competition was fierce, with everyone vying for this POR. Ironically, my teammates from the Inter IIT competition became my competitors here. April 2022 was a month of tough decisions ‚Äì whether to continue with DnA, SPO, Techkriti or pursue leadership in ICG. While I had viable chances in each of them, I ultimately chose the less-travelled and more challenging path ‚Äì the role of ICG leader. I dedicated all my time and effort to this endeavour, contacting previous leaders and engaging in discussions with consulting club leaders across India to gain insights and identify new opportunities. Finally, I made it to the position of ICG leader, fulfilling my last wish in college. After this, with the dedication and rigour I had cultivated throughout my tenure, everything fell into place naturally. ICG was a relatively unknown group on campus then, but my goal was to make it inclusive and accessible to all, fostering an environment of collaboration through projects and competitions. I aimed to lead it as I wished a senior had led me in my sophomore year ‚Äì with tranquillity, openness, and enjoyment. The connections forged, projects undertaken, friendships formed, and the unwavering support from juniors were truly surreal. For a more detailed account of my journey with ICG, feel free to visit my LinkedIn and Instagram profiles because I cannot write everything down here; Vox‚Äôs website might not just be able to handle it, lol.",
      "In essence, my decision to lead ICG stemmed from my experience with the Inter IIT, fundamentally altering my perception of consulting and data science. I transitioned from being a tech enthusiast who spent his entire second year developing interactive websites to confidently delivering arguments and presentations in a more professional setting while devising real-world solutions. This journey has transformed the world I once admired, offering new perspectives and opportunities for growth.",
      "From co-leads to best-buddies",
      "The best team I have had the privilege to lead. Their smiles have my heart forever!",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äù called it a mistake to take on the leadership of ICG during my third year (since it was a new group and had a low campus presence), but today, ‚Äúthey‚Äù acknowledge the heights the group has scaled and the personal growth it fostered among its members. As someone once said, ‚ÄúYou are just one decision away from a completely different life,‚Äù and for me, that decision was opting for ICG. The rest, as they say, is history, with the impact of ICG‚Äôs endeavours evident to all ‚Äì an outcome I had envisioned at the outset of my tenure.",

      "The summer of 2022 was a time of sheer beauty on campus. Amidst hanging out with my closest friends in canteens, libraries, and coding sessions day and night, preparing fervently for the upcoming internship drive, I found myself succumbing to the allure of caffeine at CCD. One ordinary night, an extraordinary email landed in our inboxes from Bain & Co., signalling an upcoming internship drive. The mere thought that top consulting firms like MBBs would visit IIT Kanpur for internships was beyond our expectations. The interest I had always harboured in the consulting field reached its pinnacle when Bain delivered a captivating presentation to all interested students. By then, my profile was strong enough to secure initial shortlists, leaving me in a dilemma of where to focus: on software development and coding, which I had pursued until then, or on the relatively unexplored consulting field at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Balancing my preparations, I took on all the Data Structures and Algorithms tests and secured day-one shortlists from some tech firms, as well as from Bain and BCG. Just a week before the internship drive, Bain‚Äôs networking event tilted the scales decisively in favour of the consulting industry for me. The allure of its luxurious lifestyle perfectly resonated with my passion for travelling. Consequently, I made the bold choice to opt for BCG over other tech firms during the interviews. I was very worried, and it was a risky decision, as the landscape of interning at a consulting firm was largely unknown, with scarce advice besides insights from BCG alums who had climbed the ranks post-MBA.",
      "My stint with ICG provided me with invaluable opportunities to connect with industry professionals and gain insights into the inner workings of consulting firms, instilling in me the confidence to excel in my internship. The summer of 2023 unfolded as the most memorable, industrious, and opulent chapter of my college life. Nestled in a five-star hotel on Marine Drive in Mumbai, BCG afforded me breathtaking views from my room on the 29th floor, offering a whole new perspective of India‚Äôs landscape.",
      "This building (Trident, Nariman Point) has all the emotions for my 2 months @ BCG.",
      "Working on a finance case with one of India‚Äôs largest public sector banks was a truly rewarding experience characterised by professionalism, interactivity, and fulfilment. The vibrant culture at BCG, marked by endless parties and an irresistible allure to Mumbai‚Äôs nightlife, perfectly encapsulated the ethos of ‚Äúwork hard, party harder.‚Äù Even amidst corporate commitments, I made it a point to cherish weekends with my IITK batchmates, indulging in events, cafes, or simply beach therapy. It was a harmonious blend of bustling weekdays and rejuvenating weekends, punctuated by Saturday brunches and Sunday clubbing.",
      "In retrospect, my stint at Boston Consulting Group was exceptional, culminating in a pre-placement offer that spared me from the chaos of final-year placements. Now, as I eagerly anticipate making an impact in my full-time role at BCG, I aspire to be staffed on intriguing cases, ideally in the automotive sector (for obvious reasons).",
      "Reflecting on my consulting industry experience, I implore others to heed their innermost preferences and gravitate towards what they love, where they truly belong, and where they derive genuine joy from their work. Let‚Äôs break free from the herd mentality of following friends, senior recommendations, or parental expectations. Ultimately, the satisfaction derived from our work lulls us to sleep with contentment and awakens our souls with vigour each morning.",
      "My journey began with strong academics, but now, as it draws to a close, I find myself with grades far below what I had ever imagined. My career trajectory has shifted from web development to software development and finally to the consulting industry, where I‚Äôve secured a pre-placement offer. The friends who pledged to stand by me forever in my first year have drifted away in the last, while individuals I barely knew initially have become my chosen family. Once an ambivert in my first year, I have completely transformed into an unabashed extrovert.",
      "Though I have stumbled along the way, each misstep has ultimately led to positive outcomes, allowing me to rest easy with a sense of fulfilment. This is the opportune time to embrace risks and explore your innate utility curves. Throughout my engineering years, I viewed them as a period for experimenting, testing and validating my ideas. Such opportunities are scarce later in life unless one decides to pause and restart ‚Äì and that‚Äôs rare!",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äù will always have their opinions, criticisms, and comments, but it‚Äôs up to us to discern their value. Change is inevitable and, indeed, necessary. Nothing remains permanent except, perhaps, the enduring words of this AWL on Vox‚Äôs website (fingers crossed). So, let‚Äôs welcome this journey, embracing change, making space for new experiences, and accepting the unfolding of events.",
      "Never hesitate to reach out to others, whether for assistance, companionship, or to share a few moments of camaraderie. And let‚Äôs extend a hand to our juniors, fostering the same sense of warmth and inclusivity within their ranks. My time at IIT Kanpur has been a whirlwind ride, filled with highs and lows, laughter and tears, praise and criticism, and above all, the unwavering support of my chosen family. These years in this enchanted realm have been truly invaluable. As I prepare to move forward, I do so with a heart full of gratitude and a determination to make my alma mater proud through my future endeavours. And if someday I feel restless and dissatisfied with the routine, you might find me on Instagram, cruising in the Queen‚Äôs Rolls Royce in London, baking wood-fired pizzas at Trattoria Vecchia Roma, or simply wandering to remote and untouched landscapes, hills, and beaches around the world (maybe even Mars? Let‚Äôs wait and see).",

      "Hey, this would be a story of my important milestones at IIT Kanpur. I won‚Äôt be using lucrative language. Nor is it a heroic story. Just read it with the simplicity I wrote it with.",
      "I am Vedant Gitte, a final year undergrad student of Batti. I am extremely hyperactive and you would definitely see me a lot around campus and at events. I spend the majority of the day outside my room either roaming the campus or meeting my friends. I was a CTM at Counselling Service in my third year. Where I can say I gave in all my efforts and dedication. The story just revolves around how being CTM has affected me, and how the experience has helped me through other challenges in college.",
      "I really won‚Äôt be writing much about my first year. It was the same as any other fresher in college: exploring interests, connecting with new people, and taking part in various activities.",
      "Still from Train when we were coming to college for the first time.",
      "As for the Second year, we came to campus in our 4th Semester (the first three sems were online due to the Pandemic). It was wonderful to meet people in person. I joined Volleyball then and used to spend 2 hrs on the ground daily.¬† That time was great as I felt good physically and mentally. I was also part of the Election Commission, Outreach, and Academic and Career Council. I met some nice people there. This was the time the core team member form of the Counselling Service came out.",
      "Meeting new people at IITK",
      "Through the second year, I had seen the work of Counselling Service as a Student Guide. During the first few days on campus, I saw the CTMs helping with hall allocation and other events. It exhilarated me to be part of such an organization.",
      "When the CTM form came out, I remember the discussion/talks going on l about who would be filling the forms and who had chances. Trust me, at that time at least, I didn‚Äôt come in among the most likely candidates in my Hall.",
      "When the forms came out, I remember spending the entire day and night preparing for the role. There were not many situations I had handled, nor did I have a strong personality at the time. Some people were even rude and said things like why was I even bothering to apply if there were better people in the Hall? Every small to big action I took during that time was taken considering what an ideal CTM might do. I picked up littered trash and put it in the dustbin whenever possible. I made sure to be polite to everyone, I protected someone if he/she was targeted, and I undertook responsibilities and saw them through. I proudly say even after not being a CTM for one year now, I still take every decision considering how an ideal CTM might be.",
      "Fortunately, luck was in my favor, and I did manage to be a CTM before the end of the Second year.",
      "In the third year, I had cut down my involvement to CS only. There‚Äôs a thing about CS, no matter how much time you think CS will take, CS takes a lot more. On one side, you are planning events, the flagship Orientation, and other events, and on the other side, you are dealing with problems people come to you with. There are students in Academic Probation and Warning you have to keep in constant touch with, see to it if they have any issues academically and how you can help them. You have to be emotionally involved, or else you won‚Äôt be able to give your 100%. There are situations to deal with which your juniors, your batchmates, and sometimes seniors too; come to you with. And as a CTM, you have to dedicate yourself completely to the situation.",
      "The Fresher Orientation was due in November, and our team dedicated huge efforts to it. We planned a long 10 day Orientation in which we also had our classes, quizzes, assignments, and the intern company tests going on. Understand it was the first full-fledged orientation after 2-3 years of online semesters. It was a huge success. Y22 batch students come up even now and mention how they loved Orientation 22.",

      "There will be people who come and tell you to take up Positions of Responsibility in college just for the sake of your resume and career perspective. There will always be people in the same positions as you who always prioritize their personal stuff and don‚Äôt do half the duties you do.",
      "It should not hinder you even a bit from the efforts you are putting in. The confidence gained and the personality you develop outweigh all the fragile excuses and spineless, unasked advice.",
      "With Yashvardhan, Orientation of Y22 Batch",
      "Now that Orientation was over, I became more aware of my situation academically and careerwise. I had messed up my acads a bit in the 4th and 5th semesters due to my involvements. I had spent the majority of the time of 2nd-year summer for CS and for extra courses I took, so I couldn‚Äôt prepare as it is required for the Intern Season. It was just that I had miscalculated the time commitments.",
      "I must tell you, after the orientation, I became too strong-headed. Positions, irrespective of which club, change you if you give yourself completely to them. From December, I started investing a lot of time preparing for tests, talking to seniors, reading articles, and what not. I buckled up for Intern Season Phase II. For my readers in the first year, Intern Season Phase I starts in August (5th sem), and the second season starts in late January (6th sem).",
      "I cut out the leisure time. I replaced Instagram with LinkedIn, leisure time with preparation time; in short got back into the JEE mode. Intern Phase II was a disaster in our time; an unimaginably small number of companies came. Irrespective, I put in effort and managed to get an off-campus remote internship at the end of February. I joined the internship along with the ongoing semester.¬† Since the summer internship was still pending, I continued with my efforts and managed to get off campus summer intern on May 3rd üôÇ",
      "Here, I would like to say that people give up easily if things don‚Äôt go according to what they planned. As quoted in Faults in Our Stars, ‚ÄúThe world isn‚Äôt a wish granting factory.‚Äù Whatever situation you are in, always choose to keep on fighting. Trying and failing is always better than not trying at all.",
      "Preparing for interviews",
      "Learning from past mistakes, I spent the summer judiciously studying for Placements whenever I got time. My summer intern was also remote. I specified time within the day for sports, books, office work and placement studies.Now looking back, it was a great time, as I learned to manage a lot of things.When I got back on campus, the relentless studies, company tests, and academics continued. I had Prem Milind Gujrathi, Utkarsh Kandi, and Naman Jain as my closest friends. We spend a lot of time together preparing and helping each other through the placement season.Though the Placement situation was not good this year, all four of us managed to get placed, and it was worth all the efforts we had put in.",

I thought nothing would surpass my 3rd year.¬† How wrong could I be proved? Now that I had a few months left, I decided to build habits that will help me in the long run.",
      "I have been reading a lot of self-help and fiction books. I take out 1-2 hours daily to work out. I am experimenting to be more disciplined and happier through a directed effort to grow emotionally, spiritually, and physically.

      "Within a day of joining IITK as a BT CHE admit in 2015, I was provided with a well-structured answer to this question ‚Äì codenamed‚Äòkholna‚Äô‚Äì which defined me in terms of my name, some immediate identifiers (IITK-related and hometown) and fake hobbies that need to be easy to pronounce in chaste Hindi. That‚Äôs a start, but these past nine years of my association with IITK can be best described as an ongoing journey to find an answer to this question. (If you are a part of this journey, chances are you‚Äôll find a passing reference, and if I have missed you (definitely a few!) please accept my apologies!)",
      "Diwali celebration in Hall 2 with wingmates",
      "The first few days were challenging with several firsts ‚Äì hostel life (Hall 2 culture didn‚Äôt help!), living away from home, meeting people from all over India, being stereotyped, and a general imposter syndrome. A few good scores helped with the last issue, but it took me a long time to acclimate that maybe IITians are not the glorified role models I thought they were. In about a semester, I settled in, got a grip on academics, found some friends and helpful seniors, and started warming up to try out co-curricular activities. I accompanied some friends to a Vox Populi meeting in my second semester and haven‚Äôt left since! I switched to EE in my second year ‚Äì deciding on a part of my professional identity for life.",
      "Me with my ‚Äúbachche‚Äù",
      "I became a ‚Äúbaap‚Äù, i.e., Student Guide to six first-year ‚Äúbachche‚Äù and an Academic Mentor. Vox stayed a constant. I also got actively involved in all major fests in different positions and a couple more random involvements. I even proposed to someone I was hanging out with ‚Äì a tremendous leap for a boys‚Äô school nerd ‚Äì but got turned down (we stay good friends, and she‚Äôs the first female friend I ever made ‚Äì so I am extremely grateful). To fill the void, I got into pop culture big time ‚Äì binge-watching Friends, iMDb top-rated movies, listening to Pink Floyd and the like, and memes ‚Äì and my co-curricular involvements fuelled my social media addiction. Pretty much everyoneknewme ‚Äì offline and especially online. I was selected for the CS UG Core Team (Academics). It was dizzying ‚Äì I was burning out big time. I did not like EE, and I opted for a double major and summer project in Chemistry out of interest.",
      "Core Team (Academics), Counselling Service, 2017-18",
      "EE was an extremely competitive department for me ‚Äì it took a lot more effort to maintain my grades along with co-curriculars. I couldn‚Äôt do it all and needed to restrict myself to two activities I enjoyed the most ‚Äì CS and Vox. I finally found the right set of friends ‚Äì slowly dissociating from my wing (barring a few), which had grown somewhat toxic. I was slowly but surely getting drawn more to EE, particularly communications. I had corporate and academic intern offers (Texas Instruments and NYU, respectively) in EE and opted for the latter. I eventually decided to drop my Double Major in Chemistry and take up a Dual Degree in EE instead. To end the year on a high note, I became one of the Chief Editors of Vox!",
      "This year, I had fewer things on my plate but they required considerably higher efforts. Along with co-Chief Harshit Bhalla, I was guiding Vox through a tricky phase of sustaining and motivating a small team as well as creating an impact significant enough to ruffle many feathers and take Vox to a position of credibility where it started to be viewed as a serious ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of the student community. At the same time, I did well in challenging departmental courses and UGP and landed a summer internship at UCSD. I faced severe burnout again towards the end, but I felt I had finally consolidated my identity.",
      "Core Group, Vox Populi 2018-19",
      "I was mentally all over the place in the summer ‚Äì clueless and burnt out. I learned a few things early in my internship, but everything fizzled out. Back in IITK for my Master‚Äôs, I procrastinated ‚Äì engaging in many co-curricular activities again but nothing wholeheartedly. Many friends had left after a 4-year B.Tech., so I made several new friends who, to date, form my closest circle. An off-campus job offer gave me an excuse to sit out of placements. A timely reprimand from my thesis supervisor brought me to my senses; thereafter, it was relatively smooth sailing. I ended up acclimatising well to research life. Towards the end, I eventually took my advisors‚Äô suggestion and opted for the IITK-NYU dual degree PhD program. Shortly after, COVID hit, and I had to finish my thesis work and graduate online ‚Äì at which point I felt great that I‚Äôd have another IITK convocation as a PhD student!",
      "From left ‚Äì Bharat, me, Harshit and Shivam ‚Äì friends I made in dual degree years ‚Äì a recent photograph during a suddenly planned trip to Agra (c. 2023)",
      "My PhD started in 2020 with an online semester of IITK doing PhD coursework. I finished all four courses in one semester, which was pretty hectic, along with finishing up paper submissions for my Master‚Äôs thesis work and convocation formalities for my dual degree. I secured a timely US visa, and for two years (2021-2022), I was at NYU. During this time, I finished PhD coursework at NYU, took doctoral degree-related examinations at IITK and NYU, pursued my first industry summer internship, and started my PhD dissertation work.",
      "Panwar group + IITK alumni at NYU Tandon School of Engineering",
      "I returned to IITK as a PhD student in January 2023. Life seemed a lot slower here now, and I realised soon that I didn‚Äôt have any friends here anymore. Luckily, I found some IITK UG juniors who were still around and joined their social group (hello, Gang B!), along with some batchmates and seniors. I slowly returned to some IITK activities¬† ‚Äì election officer in Hall 8, a Senate position, departmental activities, and rejoining Vox!",
      "Some IITK bucket list items got ticked off ‚Äì drunk nights in fests, visits to Ramaiya Dhaba, crashing alumni reunions, etc. I even took a leap of faith and started my first relationship. It lasted a few months, and then I realised some things weren‚Äôt working out, but I was not ready for the intense void. Work, conference travel, and therapy kept me sane. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt date again till I was back in NYC, but I couldn‚Äôt resist this wonderful human who fell for me! Almost six months in, we are still together, and hopefully for life.",
      "My NYU supervisor, Prof Shivendra Panwar, met my IITK supervisor, Dr Rohit Budhiraja, and the WiSDOm lab while visiting IITK for his alumni reunion",
      "Meanwhile, research has been going on, and it is finally taking proper shape. It looks like there‚Äôs an end in sight. My research journey hasn‚Äôt been linear in my PhD, and I allowed myself to take perhaps a detour too many. PhD is hard and tests your resilience and discipline a lot more than raw academic abilities. I‚Äôm glad I got an immersive experience of the academic cultures of India and the US. I will write more later on this, perhaps on personal blogs, once I graduate.",
      "IITK has given me everything I needed at the right time to forge my identity. I have done my fair share for IITK at various levels to make it a better and more humane place. I‚Äôm happy to be moving on from here and look forward to contributing to IITK in whatever capacity. I have lived a full life here, taking all my chances and exploring myself professionally and personally with no regrets. As I write my story after all these years, amidst all the chaos, I can observe a clear linear trajectory of growth ‚Äì personal and professional ‚Äì and in perspective, it all makes sense. I guess that‚Äôs how life should be! I‚Äôll end this long monologue with two lines from an old Hindi song which I‚Äôve been replaying in my mind for the past weeks ‚Äì",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I joined IIT Kanpur for the PhD program in Civil Engineering back in 2019. How did I land at IIT Kanpur? I chose India over the US/UK because the Ethiopian government sponsors us fully if we get admission to the top 5 IITs. There is a scarcity of professionals in Ethiopia, so the government incentivises us to study in IITs. I got into IIT Madras in 2018, but at that time, my wife had a baby, so I didn‚Äôt want to leave and hence declined the offer. The following year, I applied again and got Kanpur.",
      "Currently, we are just 3 Ethiopian students, but in 2019, we were 13. New students got admitted but are waiting in the process. We are trying to convince them to come to Kanpur. In Ethiopia, the perception of Indian education is not good due to the expat faculty working in Ethiopian universities. These faculties are from local colleges, not from IIT. So we are biased whenever we think of India, and students don‚Äôt prefer to come here.",
      "IIT Kanpur has an international relations office that looks after us. Currently, there are students from Qatar, Sudan, Myanmar, Malaysia, Nigeria, Canada, and Indonesia as well. Even though lifelong bonds are difficult to create, I have good friends like Mayank, Sanjay and my labmates, who made my stay here much more memorable. I had a great experience with the people here. They are very friendly and cooperative. Everyone is social, and sometimes I don‚Äôt feel I am away from home, family, or another country. No one tries to hurt or take advantage as I am a foreigner. I have had many memorable instances at IIT Kanpur. Like at the mess, I used to drink hot water and said ‚Äògaram‚Äô to the mess person once, but I didn‚Äôt mention ‚Äòpaani‚Äô, so he gave me roti instead!",
      "Despite some cultural differences, Indian culture, in terms of food habits, is very similar to Ethiopian culture. We mostly cook dal and have a dish similar to Dosa. We also eat food with our hands, so there are a lot of similarities in cultures. Still, how we celebrate festivals is very different. We majorly follow Christianity, so the occasions we celebrate and how we celebrate are very different. In terms of clothes, we have many similarities. We also wear dresses similar to Dhoti. The eastern part of Ethiopia is similar to the southern part of India.",
      "As a student from Ethiopia, I found the weather here quite extreme. Being so far from home, I felt homesick a fair few times. I even thought of getting my family here, but due to the pandemic, I thought it was best not to. I have three children, two boys and a girl. They are 7, 5, and 2. They are going to school. I went once to Ethiopia during COVID and didn‚Äôt go after that.",
      "Coming to my PhD journey, PhD is painful. It is a prolonged journey of continuous highs and lows. I am fortunate that my guide was very nice. He knows how to encourage you at your lows and always ensures you‚Äôre always on the right track.",
      "Currently, I‚Äôm sponsored by the government of Ethiopia. I have signed a bond with the government that I‚Äôll have to work the same amount of time in Ethiopia for all the days I‚Äôve been paid for here. I have to work there as an Assistant Professor. The topic I‚Äôve chosen for research also impacts my country in many ways. My B.Tech was in Hydraulics, and then I decided to pursue a master‚Äôs and PhD in the same domain.",
      "PhD in India is very different from that in Ethiopia. I found the hydraulics course here more Maths intensive. I didn‚Äôt do well on my 1st quiz but picked up after that. Here, you must dedicate your whole day to your research work. However, my lab atmosphere was very supportive. Everyone in the lab was very cooperative, and I got to work happily in my lab.",
      "After my PhD, I plan to return to my country and do the work I must do, primarily depending on the opportunities. If I get good opportunities outside my country, I‚Äôll go there. Otherwise, I‚Äôll stay in my country.",
      "But enough of academics! I had a great time on campus, too. I played football and went to the gym. I‚Äôve eaten in quite a lot of canteens. It depends. For example, chai is best here in H8, but for Dosa, I go to H10. I went to H12 too. For hanging out, I preferred to go outside, like Z Square. My Hindi is bad, but I navigated to Z Square on my own. I didn‚Äôt understand the prices they named, so I just handed them 500, and they gave back the change. People are cooperative. They think I am also an Indian, so I don‚Äôt get scammed.",
      "I have also roamed around locally, near Nankari, Vishal Market and even visited the leather industry. We visit the Anil Mutton shop occasionally. I also saw Gurudev Chauraha and tried the metro up to Motijheel. Before IITK, I visited IITR in a program for two weeks. I have also been to Delhi, Lucknow, Haridwar,¬† and Chandigarh.",
      "I haven‚Äôt watched a lot of Indian movies here. Still, I watched a famous Hindi Movie- ‚ÄúKuch Kuch Hota Hai‚Äù, in Ethiopia. We watched the film in Hindi, guessing dialogues from the actors‚Äô emotions. Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan are also very famous there. I also saw the film ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Lunchbox‚Äù. It‚Äôs an excellent and interesting movie. I suggest you also watch it.",
      "I have also been to concerts here! I loved Antaragni. I‚Äôve also seen Nukkad Naatak here; it was interesting. It is art, even though I don‚Äôt understand Hindi.",
      "If you ever visit Ethiopia, we have a lot of places where you can roam around and many animal parks. Of course. We are Africans! The weather is very pleasant too! I hope you get to love Ethiopia the same way I love India!",

      "The nuclear reactors run by the Department of Atomic Energy satisfy two critical needs of our nation ‚Äì nuclear energy and strategic usage. The reactor safety is analyzed by doing a scenario assessment because one cannot simulate the experimental settings in a laboratory. Regardless, we must know about the mishaps and potential damage. The idea of a nuclear energy program is to have all safety nets in place, and how to assess it is by running the safety course. The problem faced is that they can create their code to determine the safety of their reactors, but that requires validation of the code using experimental settings. The National Aerosol Facility was set up to analyze the safety of the reactors.",
      "After joining IIT Kanpur in 2003, Professor S. N. Tripathi, who had previously worked at BARC, launched the National Aerosol Facility. The facility was supposed to be built in 2018‚Äì19, but the pandemic caused the construction to be put off by more than two years. Most components and equipment are designed by BARC scientists and experts at IIT Kanpur and are indigenously made. There are around 7-8 such facilities globally, with this being the first in South Asia. Since its inception, four experiments have been conducted, collaborating with over ten scientists.",
      "Post independence, advancement in industrialization led to a desperate need for energy, and Nuclear Energy was viable. Since India didn‚Äôt sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, other nuclear countries were not ready to provide technologies to India. In 1998, after the nuclear test in India, the situation worsened due to sanctions imposed by the USA. There was a way ‚Äì to transfer knowledge in this field via educational institutes, and IIT Kanpur was one such institute.",
      "The facility encompasses two groups, one works on reactor safety (Reactor Safety Division) and the other on radiation protection (Radiological Physics & Advisory Division). There‚Äôs an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to review the safety parameters.Half of the funding for the facility comes from the institute, and the other half comes from BARC and BRNS in equal amounts. The total funding sums up to about 20 crores.",
      "When an accident occurs in a nuclear power plant, radioactive material is released into the environment and deposited inside the power plant, which may escape into the environment. This material can be in the form of aerosols. The NAF experiments study the behavior (size, growth, properties, etc.) of such radioactive aerosols and the amount of aerosol being deposited and resuspended. The goal is also to create a database from the experiments done here and use these databases to validate the accidental nuclear codes",
      "Two plasma torches in the facility are used to generate plasma. Argon is used as it isn‚Äôt expensive like helium or flammable like hydrogen. It is mixed with nitrogen to increase its enthalpy.",
      "Argon or nitrogen is also used as the carrier gas to ensure that the plasma flame doesn‚Äôt extinguish. The powder feeder directly feeds Zinc and Tin powder to the plasma flame. Upon reaching the flame, the metal powder vaporizes and goes on ahead to condense into small particles. More vapor gets deposited on the smaller particles to become bigger particles. The particle size increases as more vapor gets deposited on the smaller particles, or the particles coagulate.",
      "And thus, aerosols are generated from Zinc or Tin metal powder. As the metal vaporizes, the aerosols react with oxygen and forms zinc oxide or tin oxide.",
      "Air for a compressor can be used along with Helium or Argon as a carrier gas. The mixing vessel ensures that the generated aerosol gets the proper time and space to reach the required concentration and ensures a stabilized flow of the aerosols. The two plasma torches are beneficial as they make it possible to generate a very high concentration of aerosols or to check for a mixture of two different aerosols.",
      "The centerline temperature of the plasma flame is almost 10000C. Water circulation reduces this temperature, ensuring the flame-generating electrodes do not melt.",
      "A high voltage is supplied to the gas, creating a vast electric potential, thereby ionizing the gas, and generating plasma. Initially, the frequency is kept high and alternating to create a spark that produces plasma. It is later shifted to DC, and the plasma keeps generating.There are two different pipe sections for the supply of different gases. Pressure and flow control valves are present for each pipe to control the pressure and flow of the gases.",
      "The design pressure for the facility is 10 bar, and some components can sustain forces up to 16 bar. However, still, it is preferred to stay within the operating pressure of 5 bar. A thermal mass flow meter and vortex flow meter are used to measure the mass flow rates of the gases and steams.",
      "The facility has a boiler to observe the interaction of the aerosol particles with steam since steam is also present in the environment with other gases whenever an accident occurs in a nuclear power plant. Due to its interaction with aerosol, the steam condenses to water, which can be problematic as it can create hydrogen and leads to explosions.",
      "Two heaters (air pre-heater and air superheater) are installed to mimic the high-temperature scenarios in which accidents occur. After passing through these heaters, the components are mixed in the mixing vessel, and then they go ahead. That panel is the heat control panel.",
      "The central core contains nuclear fuels; during accidents, melting occurs (called corium), and the temperature crosses 2000C.Mineral wool is used for insulation to avoid heat loss. This mineral wool is protected by using an aluminum sheet over it.",
      "After evaluating the critical parameters, the aerosol-laden gases enter the scrubber tank filtration unit. The aerosols are filtered in this unit, and the clean gases, without any particles, move ahead. The scrubber tank has an inbuilt mechanism to maintain its water level automatically. The pressure is maintained inside the scrubber tank using Pressure Vacuum Relief Valve. The clean gases then go to the collection chamber to remove the moisture, which is vented through the vent pipe.",
      "The piping system can be cleaned using high-pressure water through the water inlet port. The water and impurities are then allowed into the drain through the drainage system.The PDPA instrument uses four laser beams to measure the aerosol particle velocity, size, and concentration via the backscattering technique.",
      "The upper floor of the NAF is dedicated to the control room. The control room hosts the PLC through which the whole NAF working can be monitored and controlled.",
      "So far, things have been going smoothly. The facility is self-sufficient concerning human capital and has assisted in publishing about a dozen research papers. The facility is expected to initiate more such projects in the future. It is also planned to set up a safety committee for the NAF.An international workshop is scheduled that the DAE chairman will inaugurate. The workshop will witness participation from countries like Spain, Japan, South Korea, etc., with good collaborations with the facility.",

      "And let us begin!College was cool. Friends, cooler, and everyone had great memories. Briefly, all of us were depressed, and finally, it turned out good‚Äîthe end.Mine and every other student‚Äôs four years are summarised neatly in these twenty-three words.So what more does Vox expect of me from this AWL, and moreover, do I have anything new to tell you?

This As We Leave plans to disappoint both. For this AWL, I had multiple ideas, and I will shoehorn each of them to confuse the hell out of you and satisfy my non-existent eloquence.",
      "I guess I am supposed to share some profound knowledge about how one should experience college. Most of what I did never had any real purpose. Just what I felt like. Nothing wise, so sorry about that. ‚ÄòMy struggle with JEE, academics, PoRs, internships, jobs, higher studies, etcetera‚Äô ‚Äì read other AWLs; they cover it much better. I am just writing this cause it looks fun, and I do not want to bore you or sadden myself.",
      "So what did I do?I studied, played around, jumped fences, skipped classes and climbed trees. I tried drugs, danced at parties, loved friends, crashed cars and sneaked onto rooftops. Listened to sad songs on loop, talked ‚Äì a lot, was silent ‚Äì even more, wrote songs, vandalised my wall, fucked around with my hair, wore lovely hats, and most of all; cycled about.My only advice is: Cycle around the campus at three in the morning, alone, with music as your auxiliary. It is fun.",
      "Currently, I am sitting worn out in my kitchen. It‚Äôs 2 in the morning. It‚Äôs a lonely city, it‚Äôs a lonely night. A quiet guilt is compelling me to complete this. I keep postponing and procrastinating. Not cause I do not have anything fun to tell. More cause I cannot seem to do it justice. All I can think of is what I would be doing if I was on campus. Probably sitting outside Hall 1 canteen. Enjoying the last call of not-so-good tea. Sharing a cigarette with friends while waiting for someone to slip on the rain-soaked muddy ground right in front of us. Just so we can get a few guilty laughs. Contemplating whether we should climb some roof or cycle out to legendary chai-wala for some 70s songs. It was so innocent. Not even a month since I left the campus, and it feels like life has paused.I am overwhelmed with entirely arbitrary memories that I never thought would be so pronounced in my stay at IITK. That ever-changing frappe at CCD, the multitude of SIS guards who have so very kindly reprimanded me, sugarcane juice in peak summer heat, foggy roads during winter nights, hour-long talks with dogs,¬† and the mango trees.Seems impossible to encapsulate my experience.",
      "The inconsequential days on campus add together, making it home. Let me give you a glimpse.A morning in January 2023:It is 8. I am running on a couple of hours. The balcony is open, letting the campus in. The loud uproar of friends outside is not annoying. Rather it gives me solace; at least someone is happy. I am giving myself a moment. Not a moment to catch up or a moment to breathe. But a moment to just sit in. Listen to some music. The graffiti is inviting. The trees are alive. And I can think of nothing. It feels strange that I am thoughtless. It is now 9. I ask the mess worker their name. Give them a chance to tell me how their morning was. They will never say anything but ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù Still, ask them. The academic area is beautiful. Does not look like before. Something changed. I guess I did. I should attend my lecture, though I have no clue what the hell is a Green‚Äôs function. But the cold grass wrapping my feet is keeping me. A few more minutes, I say to myself. I lay there and talk to the sky. Wonder if there are some aces up your sleeve. Wonder if the universe was made ‚Äì just to be seen by my eyes. And I sleep there. Again. Closing my eyes.And now I wanna go up, up and away, from this place that I call home.",
      "I once read that I should write something worth reading or do something worth writing about. One day. One day, I will have done both.So what‚Äôs missing? Aah, poetry. Wrap your minds around this now.",
      "I am notI am not those cheap shots of vodka drowning my soul.I am not the dead cigarette butts scattered by my feet,Telling me to light one more and forget it all.I am not the helpless boy praying to gods I do not believe in.I am not happy with what I have become.I am not the smile while I am holding back tears.I am not as simple as I want to be.Do not mistake me for what you think you see.I am a lie; I haven‚Äôt figured out just yet.",
      "A lie in a world of liars. How fitting.All so insincere.A neat bouquet of dead hopes shoved down our throats.Swallowing it with pride. Everyone so austere",
      "But now. Now I know what I would like.I would like to live a life I am scared of losing.To not be suffocated by every impression of me.I would like just to lie down, hear my heart beating,My existence ‚Äì enough, effortless, encompassing me.",
      "No clue why I wrote this poem, but well, it is my article, and what the fuck are you gonna do about it.I will keep this short. Down the line, even if I do not remember much, I will know that I had a great time. What more do I need?Time to open a new chapter. Somewhere far off. Cause if we don‚Äôt leave this town, we might never make it out.So I guess it‚Äôs goodbye then. Ohh, and in case I don‚Äôt see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night.",

      "Vineeth Vijayan, a graduating PhD from the Electrical Engineering department narrates the journey of this life while at IITK in the 45th edition of the AWL series.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I was in another IIT for my Ph.D. interview. Having reached two days earlier and lying in the hostel bed there, counting the sluggishly rotating fan‚Äôs ‚Äòrpm,‚Äô some invisible voice told me that Kanpur had prepared something. The following day, I flew from there to Lucknow and reached Kanpur to attend the interview. For the next seven years, I was in this historical city, in this legacy institute.",
      "The most beautiful yet challenging part of my Ph.D. was the coursework. It was arduous, and I truly felt the meaning of the greeting,¬† ‚ÄòWelcome to IIT Kanpur.‚Äù Having a non-IIT background in the preceding degrees, I had to make extraordinary efforts to remain in the race. But then, I loved how the professors taught us- brilliant teaching blended with excellent classroom conduct. Every teacher entertained questions, no matter how simple (or silly). They did not dilute standards but gradually dragged us up to the required levels. Coursework foreshadowed what awaited us and bolstered my confidence for future research.",
      "I struggled in the comprehensive exam and could not answer several questions from the panel members. I felt clearly underprepared, but fortunately, I passed. That day my supervisor called on me and strongly expressed his concerns. I conveyed my shortcomings and the causes that impacted my confidence in the exam. That open conversation helped us to strategize the take-off. He suggested some research papers to read and a coding assignment to begin the research. I was reading two articles most days and making notes for the state-of-the-art examination (SoTA). But, in the coding assignment, the optimization problem was not converging despite modifications in my program for over four months. Finally, I approached my supervisor with my problem and he replied, ‚ÄúVineeth, that‚Äôs the outcome of this assignment. Your code is correct; this method has convergence issues on bigger systems.‚Äù By that time, I was confident in coding. My SoTA went uneventful, as I was well prepared. Simultaneously, I started exploring co-curricular involvements.",
      "IIT Kanpur involves students in most decision-making. Being a faculty in a university system earlier, I knew the importance of learning academic policy-making. Such exposure would be critical for an academic career later on, especially in gaining maturity toward handling autonomy. I started volunteering as a Student Senate nominee to the DPGC of Electrical Engineering in 2016-17. From 2017 to 2019, I served in the SPGC. The executive student body entrusted me with the position of Ph.D. student representative to the academic senate in 2018-19 and retained me there till September 2022. When the same trust prevailed, I got an excellent opportunity to serve in PGARC.",
      "I listened to the issues and concerns of my colleagues patiently and conveyed them to the authority appropriately. I brought new proposals to SPGC and Senate during my term, many of which are now part of the PG manual. I had a significant role in establishing outstanding Ph.D. thesis awards in 2020. We are one of the few academic institutions in the country which offers six months of maternity leave to Ph.D. students twice during the program duration. My proposal concerning this in 2018 was positively recommended by the SPGC and wholeheartedly accepted by the senators. In my experience, when students spoke in these forums, the faculty listened and valued us. I thank the Students‚Äô Senate and the institute for these fantastic opportunities. IEEE and its Power and Energy Society (PES) were the other inspiring organizations I was involved in.",
      "But in a parallel world (!), personal life, some events were really happening!",
      "I was married (to a dentist) between my comprehensive exam and SoTA. By the time I cleared SoTA, she had cleared her NEET exam and became eligible for PG admissions. She had two choices ‚Äì Bangalore or Kanpur She opted to be with me and decided to do her masters in Prosthodontics at a Kanpur-based dental college a few miles from our campus. That decision resulted in her carrying our little one in her womb while going to the classes. In her thirteenth week, she was diagnosed with a pregnancy complication warranting complete bed rest. On several nights, IIT Kanpur‚Äôs‚Äô ambulance carried us to a city-based hospital where she was admitted for several days at frequent intervals. I had to depend on my parents to pay the hospital bills as my stipend was insufficient.",
      "The choice of Ph.D. was mine, MDS was hers, and the baby was ours. It was a time when we needed help to protect everything. Family, supervisors, our institutes, friends ‚Äì everyone supported us. Many professors with family met us in the hospital with homemade food and caring words. Many of our friends supported us as bystanders. When we needed an accommodation facility on the ground floor, with the recommendation of our HoD and DoSA, we were given temporary accommodation in the VH extension. No one asked me ‚Äòwhy too many ‚Äòchoices‚Äô together?‚Äô, instead, the question was, what else they could do for us?",
      "I should write about my supervisors here ‚Äì Prof. Abheejeet Mohapatra and Prof. S N Singh. I did not have even a single conference paper at that time. Still, they never pressured me, allowed me to opt for reduced credits, and gave me manageable tasks.",
      "Our baby was born in April 2019, and my first paper was accepted for an international conference a month later. I needed to publish papers in reputed journals now, and she had to return to college after maternity leave. Our parents came here to support us so that we resumed our academics.",
      "But then came COVID, and we returned home just before the first lockdown. I took this chance and sincerely worked on my first journal paper during those few months at home. After being rejected from two journals over six months, by addressing all those review comments, my first paper was accepted in an Elsevier journal in 2021, almost five years since I started my Ph.D. The Kanpur metro project had been completed much faster!",
      "After the COVID lockdowns, being a medical professional, my wife had to join back. Our parents could not accompany us this time as they had to look after our grandparents. It was really interesting to research distribution system optimization and babysit together during the day while my wife was on duty. I would go to the lab in the evening after my wife returned. At times we were tired and helpless but not willing to give up.",
      "In April 2022, I got my first publication in an IEEE journal, and in June, she finished her MDS. She went home with the baby now, and I could spend more time on my work. Subsequently, two more IEEE journal papers emerged from my study within six months. At the beginning of 2023, I started writing my thesis and successfully defended my Ph.D. on 30th May 2023. The second baby, my Ph.D. thesis, was delivered!",
      "There were many instances that prompted me to quit, or at many points in time, I would have fallen down. I was sad, agonized, anxious, and bankrupt. As Tagore wrote, ‚ÄúMy heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled.‚Äù But, I could not fail, because I came to IIT Kanpur following an invisible call. ‚ÄòHe‚Äô gifted me wonderful people, great pillars of systemic support, and a determination not to step back.",
      "Ph.D. life is analogous to a long flight journey. We have to be cautious during takeoff and landing. If we have good captains and first officers, we don‚Äôt need to worry amidst heavy turbulence. They will steer us to success. Let me reiterate-When we were struggling to protect our baby in his mom‚Äôs womb, my supervisors ensured that my Ph.D. dreams wouldn‚Äôt meet a premature abortion. Having such people here was the biggest blessing in life, much more valuable than any medals or awards.",
      "I am thankful to my labmates and many other friends for offering their support and help in time. But, I‚Äôll make a special mention of Shyam A B, a fellow EE Ph.D. student. He was a blessing for us here. For any help, from academics to babysitting, he was just a call away! It‚Äôs difficult to show the degree of selflessness that Shyam showed to me.",

      "Tanishq Gupta is a Y19 graduate from the Department ofBiological Sciences and Bioengineering. In this piece, hewalks you through his journey from his depression to GSOC to Singapore. Definitely no less than a roller coaster.However, it also taught him the qualities life requires the most- resilience and self-belief. Go ahead and read this AWL,Tanishq‚Äôs story will make you appreciate yourself and your abilities more",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Listen up, folks! Gather ‚Äôround for my tale. Tanishq, a name that echoed laughter & doubt. But let me tell you, when life gave me bouncers, I summoned my emotions & rose from the ashes. They jeered, I proved. Again and again and again. And just when life thought it got me good, I unleashed my secret magic tricks xD",
      "Buckle up, ‚Äôcause this AWL is no less than a roller coaster ride.",
      "9 Oct 2016, Tanishq, a 15-year-old naive boy, could never have imagined that his world was about to change forever. His Grandmother, who was everything to him, takes her last breath right in front of him. Her last wish ‚Äì Tanishq shall perform her last rites. Everyone was surprised if such a young boy could even be ready to take a huge responsibility, a responsibility he would have to carry his entire life.",
      "13 days of the funeral and the boy matured at lightning speed. Now his eyes aren‚Äôt wet but flaming with a mission to win, to leave a footprint on this world. He was willing to do anything to succeed. But all he knew was gaming; streaming could be a viable option but he was not interested in trying his luck; he wanted to win at any cost. The most structured path to win ‚Äì education, the one and only option.",
      "A minute of introspection and he knew that his current condition was not even average among his small class. How could he even think about competing with the entire nation? Aim was clear, do or die, no other option.",
      "One morning, his class teacher asked the class topper, as class 10th was ending, what he was going to do in life. He replied, ‚ÄúJEE‚Äù, and everyone praised him. She turned to Tanishq with the same question. ‚ÄúI will also clear JEE‚Äù, he said, but instead, he was met with laughter. The teacher replied with a chuckle,",
      "‚ÄúOh, you know, you have to work hard for it.‚Äù",
      "Tanishq said with confidence, ‚ÄúSo what? I will do it when the time comes.‚Äù",
      "The teacher mocked, ‚ÄúOh really? What‚Äôs your score in the half-yearly in math?‚Äù",
      "Everyone laughed but he smiled because he knew his revenge would come.",
      "The results of the annual exams were out, and Tanishq was happy with his progress. ‚Äò C‚Äô in science and a ‚ÄòB‚Äô in math, a massive improvement for him. But the school counselor suggested that he should pursue Arts, considering has a very good performance in social science. However, he was determined to take science; all he knew was JEE. Unfortunately, the CGPA cutoff to get into science was too high for him.",
      "There was a place that would welcome him with open hands ‚Äì the suicide capital of India, aka The Kota factory. Enrolled in Allen, he was allotted a mediocre batch. The shuffling test was near, and Tanishq received a rank of 246/1071. Not good, but not bad either. His batch didn‚Äôt improve. However, he was quite audacious and started to sneak into the top batch. But his loud personality made it difficult to remain incognito. Soon, his peers started to mock him.",
      "‚ÄúHaha bro, in my score 2 Tanishqs can fit in‚Äù, ‚ÄúWow, such a waste of parent‚Äôs money‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre you sure you have the IQ to study with us?‚Äù. His reply was a smile, he knew his time would come, and after months¬† his time came, he achieved a rank of 19/1041. A shockwave for everyone ‚Äì a student from a lower batch on the notice board, it‚Äôs Tanishq Gupta. His trajectory was like a rocket, shooting up in the sky, defying gravity. In Allen‚Äôs final test, he was ranked 63 among 10k+ students.",
      "‚ÄúThe Day‚Äù was here- JEE advance was tomorrow. However, his anxiety took his sleep away. That night he couldn‚Äôt even sleep for a minute. He sat for paper 1 and performed exceedingly well. ‚ÄúNothing special, just like a coaching test.‚Äù, he said. Paper 2 came, and now the toll of his sleepless night was evident as his mind began to shut down, resulting in a string of errors ‚Äì errors like those he used to commit as an amateur.",
      "Soon the results were declared. His rank in the second paper was over 100,000, yet his commendable performance in paper 1 got him a humble rank of 4871. His family, teachers & relatives were overjoyed and shocked by his achievement. But all Tanishq did was lie down and cry, shedding tears of regret because he knew what he was capable of. He wanted another chance, but a drop was not approved by anyone.",
      "Over the Facebook JEE counseling forum, a senior mentioned branch change at IIT Kanpur. A new hope. Clueless yet desperate, he chose Biological Sciences and Bioengineering (BSBE) at IIT Kanpur ‚Äì a desperate shot at a second life. To achieve it, he required a Dassa (10/10 GPA) in the first year.",
      "Tanishq‚Äôs chatterbox personality earned him the nickname ‚ÄòBulla Master,‚Äô and with attention, he was met with a mirror to reality from the world. ‚ÄúWatch your branch before talking smack to us‚Äù, ‚ÄúBro, he is from EE. He will buy you in no time.‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho does engineering to study bio? Lmao‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh, what? BSBE? I thought you were intelligent.‚Äù",
      "Tanishq, with Aman, his best friend who was also from BSBE, named themselves THE BKC ‚Äì ‚ÄòBsbe ke ch****ye‚Äô.",
      "An ordinary evening, after returning from a Dramatics practice, Tanishq‚Äôs friend asked for his phone. Tanishq handed it over. Next moment he was in the air as his friend shouted, ‚Äú24!‚Äù. A horde of batchmates swarmed him to give him a¬† ‚ÄòGPL‚Äô. The average for that exam was 9/33. To escape their kicks, he used his drama skills and pretended he was hurt below the belt xD.",
      "The mid-sem went well, and a Dassa was possible. It was the time of Antaragni, the most anticipated fest of IIT Kanpur. ‚ÄúI will study with full effort after this‚Äù, he said. However, fate had other plans. A mosquito bite caused him to get dengue, he was immediately asked to return home due to a severe drop in his Platelet count. He returned to campus with only four days left before the end-sem exam. He gave his absolute best but fell short of an A grade by 1-2 % in every course. In a week, his second chance at life was shattered, and a wave of depression washed over him. The virtual world of CS:GO, was his escape from reality. Now, Tanishq was officially a certified member of THE BKC.",
      "Covid halted everything, and Tanishq was at home. His time was divided between gaming and social media, where he loved to put hilarious comments all the time. One such incident got him banned from the photography club xD(The main comment before it got deleted received 117 haha reacts, though üôÇ ). Soon, his internet addiction became an obsession with self-help videos, and the TED talks reignited his confidence. He had self-belief and wanted revenge, but the path was unclear.",
      "Tanishq started researching and planning for his comeback. He had a plan, and it looked like reaching for the moon afar. However, In his mind, he was no less than Neil Armstrong.He must stay low-key and keep his dreams to himself, or he will just be like an NPC barking.",
      "Plan was started, it was 4th sem, Tanishq had a smart strategy- focus on a few important courses and don‚Äôt attend classes in lighter courses and get B‚Äôs with a day of study.He focused all his energies on ESO207 ( Data Structures and Algorithms ), targeting it for a retrospective ‚Äì minor in CSE, HSO201( Probability and Stats ) and Google Summer of Code.",
      "Worked as a secy web dev in Techkriti to understand software development better.¬† Everything started to fall into place. He scored 49.5/50 in the HSO midterm exam and performed well above average in ESO207. Alongside, he submitted a proposal for GSOC.",
      "As expected, he got an A in both ESO207 and HSO201. Few days later, PClUb IITK posted a poster with all the selected students for GSOC.",
      "Everyone asked if this Tanishq Gupta is the same as our Tanishq? Not possible.. How can he do it‚Ä¶.",
      "No one had a clue he was even preparing for it for months.",
      "Summer was a steep learning curve, with full focus on GSOC. You can read about his GSOC experience here (http://tiny.cc/GSOCblog). A newly formed cell, PPOC, approached him, asking if he was interested in interviewing for the head of the web team for the 2021 tenure. He agreed and convinced them that he knew a guy who was even better than him, Aman Dixit. And then, the BKC was the head of the web team of PPOC.",
      "During the summer, Esports Society launched a tournament for Valorant. Tanishq had never played this game. However, its mechanics were similar to CS:GO, and his childhood dream to become an esports player was still in him. His team lost in the first knockouts. However, he and his gaming friends watched every stream of Valorush.¬† They suspected a potential fraud in the finals- a student hired a pro player to play instead of them. He and his friends combined wrote this confession which got a lot of limelight. Their simple argument was that it‚Äôs worthless to award someone who doesn‚Äôt have feelings for the game. After all If you give a cricket medal to a football player he will never truly appreciate it",
      "Intern session started. Tanishq wasn‚Äôt worried as he was focused on Mitacs, The Canadian Research Summer Exchange Program. He still took part in the intern sessions; coding tests were too hard, a lack of preparation was visible. 5th sem was an overloaded sem, But can manage, as there shall be no other difficulties? Yes, right? Haha, U never know.",
      "Mitacs was in the bag,-8.8+ GPA, GSOC project, great sop-everything checked.",
      "Nope, he forgot he was the unluckiest person alive. Mitacs rejected him at the first step.",
      "What went wrong? Mitacs doesn‚Äôt consider a postdoc‚Äôs Letter of Recommendation. His mentor at GSOC was not a professor.",
      "Plans & Dreams shattered again. At his peak moment of confidence, God gave him a reality check. In between midsems, media.net shortlisted him. One more chance but he had no preparation. However, he still knew DSA. The interview format was 1 super hard question and 1 hour, perfect for him. In¬† the 1st interview, the interviewer was none other than Striver ( Channel: TuF ). The first 2 rounds went well. ‚ÄúDamn, I think I am in‚Äù, he thought as the last one shall be the HR round, right?",
      "No? What? A special round? He was bombarded with questions which had to be done fast,",
      "and under-practised, he gave up. *Rejected*",
      "On the guidance of seniors, he focused on cold mailing. No replies‚Ä¶ He lost hope..",
      "Let‚Äôs cut losses. No intern, no problem. Anyways, we can have a foreign intern in the last sem. Yes?",
      "Right???¬† Nope, not so easily, brother.",
      "Oh god, all the odds were against him. But he was not going to live at the mercy of his fortune. The reason for rejection is that the 7th sem had the prerequisite of that course.",
      "He mailed the professor. His argument was that the course is quite intriguing and it can really open doors for a lot of research opportunities for him. But if he does it in the 8th sem, he may not have any chance to pursue research. The argument mail was understood by the professor; it was put at ‚Äòask to meet‚Äô instead of rejection",
      "During the call, the professor clearly said he can‚Äôt give the course as he had not done the pre-requisite. Tanishq claimed he had already know the pre-requisite well enough from resources like MIT coursework‚Ä¶ Professor asked questions to recheck to test his words. His answers were convincing though‚Ä¶ Woah but how was he able to pull off?",
      "After a few days he receives an email from University of California, San Diego with an assignment. He solves and gives immediately and he was awarded an internship. God is with him.",
      "Pre-registration starts for the 7th sem, his last sem and the Toughest ‚Äì 65 credits + placements + finding an international thesis, completion of the degree with 2 cse minor and 8.5 cpi ( distinction ). HSS was a lucky draw, and he got his 17th / last priority one.",
      "Nope, not taking this L. Can‚Äôt risk a hard HSS, had to play his card again.",
      "Everyone had an eye on the Art course, the professor is generous with grades. A normal request is not going to be entertained, an out of the box mail was required.¬† And it worked. He got into the Art course while everyone else was rejected.",
      "Summer started and he was supposed to prepare for placements.",
      "He got another chance with valoRush‚Äô22. He practised and practised day and night to win this tournament. And with his great team he went on to win that Pan IIT tournament. (epic play)For him, it was a childhood dream come true. But the amount of time spent on Valorant got him hooked again to his age-old gaming addiction‚Ä¶ 15hrs straight playing. No problem, sir.",
      "Tanishq‚Äôs aloof personality never shows any sign that he is serious about his life. Everyone is shocked and believes that he was a snake and he is doing some sort of cheating to achieve all this. He started to catch endless hate and losing friends. Reality check was at Antaragni when two of his very good friends, with whom he used to spend a lot of time, got completely drunk and said very mean things to him on his face, one even tried to beat him. In their intoxicated state, they expressed that it‚Äôs not just them, but everyone he thinks is their friend, doesn‚Äôt actually like him. The reality was hard to swallow.",
      "Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt get a slot with his wing and he moved to Hall 9. He was alone, he already started to feel insecure because no one liked him, he was gaming all day. Desperate to leave his one addiction, he moved to scrolling on deep internet forums.",
      "Loneliness, the internet and a lot of factors happened,¬† and he became so insecure. From existential crisis to depression to imposter syndrome, he started to have it all.",
      "Alone uninterested in studies, he found his happiness in decorating his room, which was undoubtedly the best room in H9. (room tour )",
      "All he did was sit in his room to avoid social life, random sleeping hours and just go to the canteen to chat with people like it was normal & everything was fine, but he knew it was not. Something came and went, and it was getting difficult to understand his mind.",
      "Esports society approached him with a new tournament, Lucknow Redbull Campus Clutch. He was going to play for IIT Kanpur. Gaming was an addiction, but it still was a safe life for him. He felt very confident & secured with his skills. After a week of practice and IIT Kanpur beat Immortal ( valorant‚Äôs best players ) opponents like nothing and won the tournament. He played so well that the opponents were asking who the hell is TaDark1‚Ä¶ It was Tanishq‚Äôs IGN.",
      "Without realizing it was midterms already, No way, this was the hardest sem, and he didn‚Äôt have a clue what was happening. He studied for a day and gave the exams. The courses were no joke this time. It was way more complicated than his imagination.",
      "For him, Bio courses were a one-day thing, but CS647 ( Algo III ) and CS690 were Master/Ph.D. level courses and were too hard to understand even a bit.",
      "During the midsem of one bio course, a tragedy happens‚Ä¶ Tanishq was suspected of cheating‚Ä¶ The professor doubted something and angrily grabbed Tanishq‚Äôs copy and asked him to¬† sit in the front seat and give the test.",
      "The test went well. He was already prepared for this exam.",
      "After midsem, the professor called Tanishq in his office. He says, ‚Äù This is a severe matter. I have received four anonymous emails that you cheat in every course. I have already suspected, however you did well in the exam so, no issue from my side. Still. I will forward this to the mail to the bsbe committee .

Even 5.2 SPI will do it, but passing those two courses was the main task.

      "SPO argued either dropping the placement at Rakuten or dropping Singapore intern as the remaining course. Dropping the NTU Singapore internship was more sensible as going there would cause an extension of his degree.",

      "This AWL is not about whether Tanishq was right or wrong, good or bad. Matter of fact is that the¬† story‚Äôs takeaway has nothing to do with Tanishq. Tanishq is a mask, a name used to identify the protagonist of the story.",

      "Revamp your mindset. All those people around you on social media or in real life, they are them, and you are you. If you are stuck comparing yourself, you will lose your individuality.

She recalls her calling for music and the 4 year journey in which she discovered inner harmony and grew as a person. Come along in the ride to know more about her expectations, her takeaways and the moments that left the deepest impressions on her.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hi there!",
      "So I had very ambitious ideas to make this one fun but also useful to the readers. But just as I anticipated, it is quite difficult to put down the essence of college life in a few paragraphs.",
      "When I reminisce about my time on campus, I think of the silliest things. Like this one time, a friend I‚Äôd just made almost got us into a crash, saying he knew how to ride a scooty. Or when a dog decided to run away with one of my sandals. The time when I was dared by a friend to do mujra on the mess table (was very embarrassing lol).¬† Or the one when I‚Äôd unplugged a live guitar cable on stage (leading to grand ‚Äú‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§ï ‡§¨‡•á‡§á‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§§‡•Ä‚Äù). And not to forget, the time we had a twist in plans because one of our friends had a medical emergency! The list goes on with many such incidents I would remember for the years to come. It‚Äôs funny how the most insignificant moments often leave the deepest impressions. But to keep this short, here‚Äôs a little reflective piece with a few bits of advice that I got and learned over these four years at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Unlike most people, when I came here for the first time, I barely had any expectations from college. I just wanted to fit in and adapt to the new environment as quickly as possible and of course, build a career for myself. I had my inhibitions about whether or not I‚Äôd get along with people here.",
      "But to my surprise, it came to me naturally. I barely found myself putting any effort into adapting to the new place, engaging in conversations with people, embracing new cultures, living on my own for the first time, and even learning Hindi, a language I had often heard but never spoke. I also explored various clubs and activities in college, especially the music club and the anime society (a rare first to see the anime-watching folks have a circle of their own ;), which helped me meet new people with similar interests. And so I quickly connected with some like-minded folks who I could hang out with.",
      "And naturally, amidst the allures of the new college life, I almost lost sight of my primary purpose of being here, which is to study. I‚Äôm sure quite a few of us can relate to that. Being in a prestigious institution, it was apparent that the majority of studaents here were highly skilled and academically inclined, far more than I‚Äôd initially realized. Which meant that I had to put in more effort to keep up with everyone else. My first semester went by in a flash, as I was jamming and pulling all-nighters. Before I realized it, I got very close to failing a course, which was a harsh wake-up call to me!",
      "Those experiences led me to start paying more attention to my classes, and I spoke to a lot of seniors regarding the career paths I could explore.",
      "You might assume that I‚Äôve had it easy because I was from the esteemed Computer Science Department. While I acknowledge that it was indeed a privilege, I did face my fair share of challenges to meet up with the ‚ÄòCSE standards‚Äô.",
      "In general, I felt somewhat disconnected from my peers in the department because I had my own apprehensions about not sharing the same kind of enthusiasm for core CSE subjects at the time. The lockdown only made it worse because we never even had offline classes together. I‚Äôd also devoted a significant portion of my time to extracurricular activities, which reflected on my academics. The constant pressure of not knowing where I fit in among individuals who were deeply passionate about their chosen paths was real. It often left me with a sense of purposelessness whenever I contemplated the situation.",
      "By the start of my 2nd year summers, most people knew what they wanted to pursue while I was still trying to figure it all out. I tried coding for a while but didn‚Äôt find it very amusing. In hindsight, I do feel like I should‚Äôve given it more time. Sometimes it felt like I had no particular interest in anything CSE related. This made me realize that I hadn‚Äôt explored the domain enough, apart from the few courses I‚Äôve done.",
      "",
      "I‚Äôm glad I made some unanticipated yet good choices in my second year that helped me figure out a lot about what I may be interested in. I had taken up a couple of projects during the summer wherein I delved into some practical aspects of machine learning, which I actually enjoyed studying about. And despite not being particularly skilled with coding at the time, the projects I had undertaken played a huge role in securing me an internship. I surely felt lucky to have gotten the internship from the only company I had gone through the interview process with! This made me realize thateven if you‚Äôre unsure of what you want to do, keep yourself busy with something or the other and you‚Äôll eventually discover what works for you.",
      "One valuable lesson I learned during that time was to never miss out on filling up an application form because you think you may not be good enough for it. Sometimes, the odds may work in your favor, and other times, you may simply be underestimating your own abilities. Regardless, it‚Äôs essential to take that chance because you‚Äôll never know until you make it! For instance, I‚Äôd applied for the Google Research Week, a conference for students enthusiastic about state-of-the-art ML research. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get accepted because I had very minimal experience, but I did and I got to learn so much from it.",
      "You get to see all kinds of people in college. Some know exactly what they want in life right from the get-go, and some are unsure of whether they even have something they are passionate about. I was one of the latter ones and probably still am. But I‚Äôm more comfortable knowing that about myself now. It‚Äôs alright not to have a passion. As long as you‚Äôre not terrible at what you‚Äôre doing or just hate doing it, you don‚Äôt have to be passionate about everything you do. If you think about it, there are some things you enjoy doing more than the others.Just find joy in those little things and give your best effort in whatever role you‚Äôre playing.",
      "A huge part of my college life was music! I‚Äôve always liked singing to myself but I‚Äôd never pursued it because I was unaware of whether I was actually good at it. Entering the music club was that bit of validation I needed to be brave enough to showcase what I had. And with that, I went from quietly singing in my bathroom to belting melodies in the OAT. I feel a lot more relaxed and confident while speaking or performing now, which is a very useful skill to have.",
      "I‚Äôve seen a lot of people choose not to participate in any clubs or societies, maybe because they are highly focused on their acads or it‚Äôs just a general lack of interest. From my experience, almost all clubs and societies are quite welcoming and the bonds formed with people striving to give their best for a common goal are purely amazing. You‚Äôll get to witness a whole lot of that if you‚Äôre part of any group, be it a tech club or a fest team.",
      "The music club was that place of comfort for me. There was always someone ready to help me out, whether it was to learn how to play an instrument or to get life advice in general. The combination of extremely supportive people and my love for music kept drawing me back to the club time and time again.",
      "Going along those lines, if you have some time apart from things you‚Äôre already involved in, I would advise you to take up a position of responsibility (and no, not for the sake of putting it on your resume!). I, for one, was the coordinator of the music club. Being in a managerial position for the first time taught me how to do and delegate work alongside handling my own academics and personal life. And even during the mundane lockdown period, the club kept me engaged and provided opportunities for interaction.",
      "Though I cherished my time as a coordinator, it was undeniably exhausting for me. I had underestimated the difficulty of getting people to listen, especially when we were all in the comfort of our homes. In my sixth semester, the stress of handling the coordinator role, and taking the dreaded compilers course, while also having health issues was awful. At several points, I‚Äôd almost given up and cried my eyes out about how things were going downhill in my life. But I did get through everything without any major mishaps. It was in times like these that I needed my friends the most; they were truly amazing therapists in disguise. This experience taught me to thrive in a setting where I had to push beyond my limits, which was another valuable lesson. One particularly challenging yet fulfilling experience was organizing the Musical Extravaganza for the campus community, the only offline event of my tenure. We had so much fun conducting that one!",
      "In hindsight, things almost always fell into place for me. I realize that I‚Äôd taken things too seriously sometimes and would fret about them when they didn‚Äôt go according to the plan.",
      "Don‚Äôt burden yourself by taking life too seriously.It‚Äôs okay to miss a couple of classes, it‚Äôs okay to pull an all-nighter once in a while, it‚Äôs okay to sleep through the day and do nothing at all sometimes, it‚Äôs okay to miss that 5 percent quiz you studied very hard for but accidentally fell asleep before giving it (yes, you don‚Äôt have to beat yourself up for it).",
      "It‚Äôs also okay to go ahead with some of yourcheap thrillsin college. But you should absolutely not throw your life away for the sake of momentary pleasures. You‚Äôll never know when you start getting addicted and go down a rabbit hole with almost no way out. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs easier said than done but you must know when to stop and get back on track.",
      "Of course, looking back, there are some things I regret. One was not being able to build meaningful connections with professors. Quite a few professors are enthusiastic about interacting with students and we must capitalize on that. Another one is neglecting my health during college. I would get extremely sick sometimes, both mentally and physically, mostly because I wouldn‚Äôt eat or sleep properly and take way too much stress about things. It‚Äôs best to pick up some sport or hit the gym and make it a habit before it‚Äôs too late!",
      "Lastly, the biggest takeaway from college is undoubtedly the people I‚Äôve met here. This is where you make friendships you will cherish the most.",
      "Whether it was having deep conversations about life or receiving those much-needed words of encouragement, my friends have been there for me in countless ways. I‚Äôm sure that each one of us has such people in our life. Don‚Äôt hesitate to go that extra mile for those people when they‚Äôre going through a rough patch and prioritize them over yourself when you have to. Along the journey, you might drift apart from a few people but the friends you make will be very valuable. Every interaction I‚Äôve had with the people on campus isone to treasure. Even the smallest of them have the power to bring so much joy ‚Äì don‚Äôt miss out on that. I genuinely feel blessed to have crossed paths with such amazing people, seniors, juniors, and batchmates alike.",
      "‚ÄòFinding harmony‚Äô is a little pun on how I started off as someone who struggled to discern harmonies to someone who now tries to harmonize with every song I hear. In a more abstractsense, I discovered inner harmony and grew as a person along the way. In these years, I connected with many supportive people who shared their stories and listened to mine, and I‚Äôm grateful for the myriad experiences and opportunities that have shaped me into who I am today.",
      "The campus, to me, is a place I could call home, where even walking on the roads at 3 AM in the night is no big deal. No matter how badly you hate the mess food or how extreme the weather here is, you will remember these four years at college with fondness for the rest of your life. So make the most of every moment you spend here and create wonderful memories!",

In these 7 years,I am more secure and tolerant of who I am. I am content with who I am. In the lab or real life, I no longer seek approbation. I don‚Äôt attempt to be better than anyone else; I have to do my best. I don‚Äôt wait for others to celebrate me or my work.",
      "I am not sure if I had any dream at the start of my PhD, but I am leaving as someone who enjoys the research process and wants to pursue more and more research. That‚Äôs a victory!Instead of merely drifting along, I‚Äôve begun to construct my own path.My path to realising my ambitions begins now.",
      "Before I begin to elaborate my story a big shout out to all the things that have stayed with me throughout my journey and made this transformation possible ‚Äì poetry, colours, the administrative posts and most significantly all those good friends who came to my aid.",
      "I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degrees from the University of Allahabad, and like many other Illahabadis, I hoped to join the fabled IAS and serve the country. However, I did not have much support for the same, so I decided to pursue my interest in psychology by enrolling in research at IITK. I didn‚Äôt want to go into research because all I saw were sad and disappointed faces in PhD, but I didn‚Äôt have many options at the time. I was terrified! I was terrified to death! However, these seven years proved to be the best seven years of my life. And everyone who knows me knows me as a PhD candidate with a ‚Äòlife‚Äô!",
      "What exactly are these courses? What is the objective of studying them for PhD? I still haven‚Äôt come up with compelling answers to these queries!",
      "It was jarring to see folks who had never met the person living next to their room. It was unusual to see folks in corridors not welcoming their wingies. I recall being so stressed during my first month on campus that I could hear my heartbeat every time I woke up in the morning. Because I didn‚Äôt like it here, I didn‚Äôt do well in my first semester! I got 3 Bs and 1 C grade. Some of my seniors here taught me not to expect much from the people here.",
      "However, by the second semester, I had pulled my socks up and earned As and Ss. No Xs till the end of the PhD after that. Luckily!",
      "Farhan Akhtar‚Äôs performance in Techkriti was the highlight for a newcomer in IIT. I consider myself privileged to listen to Piyush Mishra and Indian Ocean live. I need not mention other amazing performances and events at Techkriti and Antaragni.",
      "I took my parents for a trip to Manali on my earnings. Everything was almost getting on the track, but just as I was beginning to enjoy my work, BAMMMMM! ‚ÄòBeta, aapko TB ho gaya hai. Kara lo operation!‚Äô It could not be cured with paracetamol and vitamin B. Fortunately, it was the most frequent skin TB, so I was able to fight it very easily. However, the initial days of hefty dosage of 3000 mg drugs were difficult to deal with in Kanpur during the scorching month of April. Poetry became my tool to attain calmness. It still is. Those who had visited my hostel room could spot a huge space allotted to the books on poetry‚Ä¶be it Urdu, Hindi, or English.",
      "My comprehensive examination went pretty average. Only one of the four members was impressed. It was difficult to imagine myself in that situation, having gone from being a Gold Medalist at university to being simply an average PhD student grappling with her research question.",
      "I was still taking my medications and experiencing negative effects during my SoTA. I stood at the podium for 30 minutes and my feet were shivering for 30 minutes. Overall, I was pleased with the feedback. But one issue nagged at me: ‚ÄúWhat is the point of my research?‚Äù What is the point of learning about face processing in the brain?!?!?! Did I get the answer? Continue reading to find out.",
      "The experiments were going swimmingly. I received the mail for the HEC election unexpectedly one day. Unfortunately, I had no idea what HEC was. After two years of PhD studies, I had no idea what HEC was! It demonstrates how indifferent some PhDs are to the community in which they live.",
      "Anyway‚Ä¶I attended the meeting with the then-current President. She recognised something in me and suggested me, to go for the role of President. I recognised that this was my chance to acquire a taste of administration, something I had previously been unable to pursue.",
      "Many people inside and outside the hostel predicted that I would lose because my opponent came from the most popular and common group on campus, but for the first time, GH1 witnessed door-to-door campaigning (by me). Fortunately, I won by about 30 votes.",
      "I learned a lot during my presidency, but one thing will stick with me: administration is not synonymous to UPSC. Many Central Universities are struggling simply because they lack good administrators. IITs are significantly superior to Central and State Universities, although it has its own set of minor and big flaws. If you have attended the open and closed door meetings at IITK, you would understand. Many professors do not even recognise the need of UG and PG committee members. In some meetings, students are not always treated equally. I consider myself fortunate to have worked with several professors who are unbiased and do not regard UG and PG students as ‚Äúkids.‚Äù I enjoyed arguments with the security section whenever they imposed regressive norms and rules. ‚ÄòDocument dikhaiye, kahan likha hai,‚Äô was always my initial response. Saving the jobs of some staff members was the highlight of my tenure for me. I organised plantation drives, eco-friendly holi and diwali, sessions on usage of menstrual cups, yoga classes in GH1, etc. The most debatable issue will forever be of the dogs in the hostel. And the chillest aspect of the HEC experience was the HEC parties at the end of the tenure.",
      "On the research front, I began to accept failure without questioning my abilities. I began focusing on the process rather than the end result of an experiment. I realised that method is the most crucial path for any effective research. Avoid falling in love with your research question or idea. Be truthful about the process. Intelligence is not as crucial as hard work and consistency. I also understood with time that I need a break from my work every two-three months to regain my energy, so I had trips to various cities in India throughout my PhD. I strongly recommend PhD scholars to understand what their mind needs for refreshment. I support the concept of delay of gratification, but it does not mean that we ruin our journey to make our destination fancy in the eyes of our family, relatives, or supervisor. Hardwork is important, but enjoying that hard work is also important. Getting out of your comfort zone is important, but mental health is also important. Struggle need not be frustrating or suffering, it can be enjoyable. Don‚Äôt be overambitious and under ambitious for PhD. Balance in life is the key to everything. Understand your balance. Involve yourself in activities and life outside your lab. Else, be ready for a world full of anxiety and stress.",
      "My very first conference presentation was at Leuven, Belgium. I also got awarded a travel grant of 500 Euros by the organisers. It was a joyous time for my family because no one had ever gotten out of India before. My most impressive presentation till date. And I got to meet several of the well-known cognitive scientists whose work I cited in my presentation. It was a fangirl moment! I travelled solo to Brussels, Leuven, and Paris. Definitely one of the most memorable periods of my life. Meeting independent females of age 20 to age 55 of different ethnicities at dorms was completely novel. One of the friends I made there was a grandma of three infants, and she used to travel by car from Amsterdam to Leuven every fortnight to meet her friends. We are still friends on Facebook and in touch.",
      "As a senator in Gymkhana and acting PG representative in several meetings, I advocated for the PhD supervisor feedback mechanism from PG students. All I heard were excuses‚Ä¶from professors, students who sought to curry favour with some professors, and elected/nominated students. I have not yet succeeded; perhaps I did not try hard enough. However, as an alumni, I still vouch for it. I shall carry on this fight wherever I go. I was fortunate to have a normal supervisor who supported me and allowed me ample leeway. However, the PhD culture has deteriorated to the point where even normal appears fantastic and privileged. Not everyone is as fortunate as I am. We still need to put in a lot of effort for the ‚Äòunlucky‚Äô PhD students. It is beneficial to have counsellors on campus, but picture a higher education system in which students do not visit counsellors because of their toxic lab culture.",
      "Enters COVID! Life is a slog. I cried a lot! Experiments were halted. It was difficult to survive at home. I used to make 500 gms sweets every second day, and ate 450 gms everytime. The coping mechanisms I used initially were not healthy at all. But later, Art of Living sessions, the series This is Us, stray dogs, cats, hobbies, and phone calls with pals all came to my aid. I began attending counselling sessions with a person I met online. As a psychology student and teacher, as well as a cognitive scientist, I was more interested in Jung‚Äôs approach of counselling than in receiving counselling. I attended some sessions and gained some insights.",
      "I can‚Äôt go into detail about my SSAC experience because those meetings are strictly confidential, but I had a great time being a part of it. Thanks to the interviewers who chose me for this position. It also increased my self-confidence in numerous ways. I met some really kind-hearted professors in the committee who understood the concepts of reinforcement and punishment.",
      "After two rejections, my first paper was accepted for publication.",
      "I intended to finish my thesis work by now, but I was dealing with every imaginable negative effect of being my guide‚Äôs first student. If you believe that the first PhD student is treated as the first born kid, please do not generalise! My guide‚Äôs encouragement eventually compelled me to master new talents. But, truly, the government should prioritise accelerating degree completion by 5 years. Alternatively, grant funds to PhD students until the thesis is submitted.",
      "To accomplish my final study, I learnt and designed online experiments. My learning graph was satisfactory. My personal life, on the other hand, became a little wobbly about this time. Breakups and tricky situations with friends hurt just as much as problems with your relationship. I also experienced a conflict of emotions to see my friends leaving the campus for a better job or PhD opportunity. It‚Äôs never a good feeling when your regular contact in your hostel or lab leaves the campus. I am fortunate to have a lot of female pals here which was never the case in my school, University of Allahabad or even my hometown. But academia is about having pals with whom you closely identify settling far away from you.",
      "However, a piece of good news from this year was that I overcame my fear of dogs. Earlier people used to ‚Äòsave‚Äô me from the strays. Now I help terrified people in passing through corridors or streets where there is a pack of dogs. In addition, I became the proud aunt of a dog (bitch, actually) named Nymeria, who came to my room every day to sleep comfortably. She‚Äôs no ferocious Nymeria from Game of Thrones. She is actually the opposite, and I‚Äôm not sure who gave her that name, but I adore that kid. My Instagram handle contains reels of the cute canines (Dusky, Bruno, Gray, etc) from GH1. Do watch!",
      "The campus also witnessed probably the only successful protest in my seven years of journey. The protest aimed at inter-hostel movement post COVID. I recall this protest as a memory that I can leave administration/politics, but administration/politics can not leave me.",
      "The second paper got published and was accepted for oral presentation in the world‚Äôs premier Cognitive Science conference. I also received an award of 1000 USD. I was fine. Not excited! Ya‚Ä¶PhD has that effect on some people. You are not happy or excited. You are just content that the work has been completed.",
      "One unusual event in my final year was a potluck at the Cognitive Science department, where the professors of the department were the chefs and the majority of the students were their sous-chefs or assistants. Activities like these provide colour and a sense of community to the department. It is a concept I am stealing for my next job in any department.",
      "After the open seminar and before submitting my application, I met the most incredible guy (also my trainer) on campus who joined me on the Annapurna Base Camp trek (4130 m)‚Ä¶the journey for which I was officially rejected by the Adventure Club. The trek of approximately 70 kms was completed in 5 days. I give myself a pat on the back for this. I also participated in a 10 km cross country run which was never in my wildest imaginations.",
      "This journey reminded me of my PhD. There were numerous uphills and downhills, but one had to persevere. I took short breaks to re-energize myself, but I never stopped. I wasn‚Äôt running, but I was heading in the right direction. My trainer referred to me as a tortoise and a true pahaadan. I cried when I arrived at Base Camp. Similarly, I cried when I defended my work in March 2023. Trekking the mountains reminded me that my troubles and issues are not as powerful as I am. The mind is our most powerful entity; once it makes a decision, it follows through on it. And PhD taught me that if you are unable to attain or fulfil your goals despite your best efforts, accept it and continue to work hard for your daily minor goals and life‚Äôs larger goals with devotion and honesty.",
      "In my final year of PhD, I did not involve myself in administration, but the expulsion of dogs from hostel in the harsh winter, the dysfunction of some clubs, inter-departmental rivalry, and the abrupt construction in GH1, as well as the reactions of elected members and chair holders in that situation, were devastating. Earlier, this was not the case with our administration. It had flaws, but people were willing to strive for improvement. Elected officials used to pay attention. They did things for people. At the very least, they tried‚Ä¶ However, many new position holders do not want to know how open the culture was, there are physical and mental barriers everywhere, there is no courage left to even take calculated risks, and ego is so high that feedback/suggestion from seniors is considered an insult. We urgently require better elected/nominated/interviewed representatives. I hope that those who have joined student committees this session are willing to work honestly for students and our respected campus.",
      "They argue that PhDs and research should be about benefiting society rather than pursuing academic honours. Throughout my PhD career, I came across this remark numerous times and questioned my work hundreds of times. The journey has taught me that just as every component and the specific colour pattern of that component in a jigsaw puzzle is important in making a whole story, so is every basic and small research question in leading to a question that helps in improving the specific domains of a society and, ultimately, as a whole. The key is to begin with a question that seeks to answer a problem.",
      "They told me a PhD makes you a better person, not just a scholar. I used to assume it was just another sanctimonious phrase made by experts to get people to take PhD seriously. However, the voyage taught me how true this sentence is. I certainly do not consider myself an expert in the field of self-face processing, let alone cognition. However, the process has taught me to deal with setbacks, overcome lack of confidence, develop a willingness to investigate different approaches to solving an issue, moving outside of my comfort zone, and so on.",
      "I applied for postdoctoral posts outside India in a few places, but the process was taking too long, and I needed to be financially stable as soon as possible. I had already spent the entire previous year on my savings. So now I am joining O P Jindal Global University as an Assistant Professor, but fortunately, I am also going to collaborate with the researchers I wanted to work with for a postdoc. I am really pleased to begin my new career as a research principal investigator, teacher, and administrator. I want to investigate how my work can be beneficial to people with distorted faces, autism, depression, anorexia nervosa, and Alzheimer‚Äôs. Using AI in social media, it has the potential to reduce prejudices, promote empathy, and increase accountability and good conduct.",
      "Finally, I would like to thank everyone who came across me and helped me along the way. Whether it is my coworkers, friends, supervisor, Gymkhana, hostel residents, employees, workers, juice wale bhaiya, cycle wale bhaiya, and so on. I am going to miss the lemon poppyseed cake at CCD, Hall 11‚Äôs canteen food, my mess food, the birthday parties at OAT, conditioning at PE ground, pyjama parties with my girls, the late-night ice-creams and walks, movie nights, discussions on casteism to multiverse‚Ä¶the list is never ending. This campus has given me a large amount of joy, experiences, and lessons that I will treasure for the rest of my life. IIT Kanpur ka tempo‚Ä¶HIGH HAI! Bye-bye, adios!",

      "Muzzammil is a graduating Y19 student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. In the fortieth edition of As We Leave, Muzzammil reflects on his college experiences, urging readers not to imitate others and create their own memories.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Having gone through most of the As We Leave articles by seniors, I don‚Äôt think any aspect of college life has been spared to talk about, and all the As We Leave articles till date have beautifully outlined all the facets of our college experiences, be it academics, college culture, the freedom that we have at IITK, the lifelong friends that we get from here, stories of failures, stories of success, stories of surprises, and their smiles and tears. However, one important thing to note here is that ‚ÄúIt was their college life, their friends, their experiences‚Ä¶their memories. You have to create yours.‚Äù",
      "Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of ‚Äútreading the footsteps‚Äù of a particular senior. Two prime reasons: It‚Äôs not possible statistically that all the events that happened in their lives will happen with you too. Secondly, in this process of imitating someone, you lose yourself.",
      "Inspired by the above insight and multiple failed attempts to write an autobiographical AWL, I concluded that memories of the whole four years cannot be jotted down. It has to be lived‚Ä¶there and then. The goosebumps I feel going down memory lane are because ‚ÄòI‚Äô have lived it, and that‚Äôs why I cherish it. It would not help you much to know the minutes of my college life. You will have your set of friends: your college bestie, let‚Äôs call him Varenya; your poet friend; for the moment, let‚Äôs assign the name Viplav to him; your MC friend, who may be named Sparsh; your secret friends WhatsApp group; let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄòMoradabadi Biryani‚Äô for a while. (The names are imaginary. Source: trust me, bro) The list is endless; above were a few examples.",
      "Our campus is beautiful, isn‚Äôt it? Having all the shades that you can expect. Flowers in full bloom, peacocks roaming around, colorful leaves strewn all around the tall, strong trees. Also, there is a calming silence and tranquility that you can feel if you have walked alone here. Only when you are out of the college and hear the regular honks and inhale all the obnoxious exhaust gases do you recall how clean and peaceful the campus is. Moreover, we have all the facilities nearby: a gym, a sports complex, canteens, and other shops. I won‚Äôt even mind living here for a lifetime; it‚Äôs such an easygoing place.",
      "Despite all this tranquility, beauty and convenience, if you pick a random dude and ask how‚Äôs life, get ready to hear ‚ÄòBahut BT hai life me‚Äô, ‚ÄòTumhara toh sahi hai‚Ä¶meri lagi padi hai‚Äô, ‚ÄòCouldn‚Äôt live up to the expectations‚Äô, ‚ÄòDisappointed‚Äô, ‚ÄòBas ye intern lag jaye then life sorted hai‚Äô, ‚ÄòYe sem bahut heavy hai yaar, agle sem maze karenge‚Äô, ‚ÄòAap toh chaapu ho‚Ä¶ ham gareebo ka kaha kuch sort hota‚Äô. Notwithstanding the outside environment you live in, on the inside, it‚Äôs full of chaos, broken dreams, feelings of despair, feelings of hard work not paying off, impostor syndrome, and feelings of jealousy as to why ‚Äúthis guy gets everything easily and I can‚Äôt‚Äù. We are in the continuous state of being unsatisfied with whatever we have achieved in life and in the incessant run for achieving the next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù in life, with the obstinate illusion that once this next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù is achieved, life will be heaven.",
      "The problem is this: We wish to get something. However, what we can do on our part is only 0.0001% of what all it takes to get the wish to be fulfilled. The rest, 99.9999%, is still in the hands of the world around us, over which we have no control. Take some time to digest it. Therefore, things are happening as they should, causally speaking; it‚Äôs just that they might not be aligned with our wishes.",
      "The best we can do is play our part, and instead of worrying about the outcomes, let the events unfold in front of us.",
      "I won‚Äôt say I was in any way different. I also thought, Bas double dassa aa jae, and get my department changed to CSE, then everything would be chill and life would be heaven. I got it changed, and then I tried to squeeze out all the elixir of joy I could from this achievement. You know what? It didn‚Äôt last for more than 3‚Äì4 days. I won‚Äôt be the first to experience this; all of you have achieved something or other in life. The joy doesn‚Äôt last long. With department change came the impostor syndrome that I wouldn‚Äôt be as good a software engineer as my peers who were already in the department. The run goes on. ‚ÄòHigh CPI rakhta. It would help me land good offers even if I was bad in CP‚Äô. Again, things went well. Got the ‚Äúforeign‚Äù intern offer from Samsung South Korea. ‚ÄúBahut badhiya.‚Äù Then? Again, a few applauses from close ones, again the process of squeezing out all the nectar I could. No matter how hard I tried to cling to this happiness derived from the achievement, it didn‚Äôt last long. ‚ÄòPPO mil jaye, job pakki, phir toh life set, uske baad maze krenge‚Äô, again stupid it is, but that‚Äôs what I believe runs through the minds of most of us.",
      "Adding to the already existing long list of insecurities, there is the paradoxical comparison of apples and oranges. ‚ÄòUsko dance bhi aata, sketch bhi karleta, wo guitar bhi baja leta‚Äô. I can‚Äôt do anything; I‚Äôm useless. Whenever we do this kind of comparison, we forget how diverse the backgrounds of the people here are. Be it the financial background, the regional background, the cultural background‚Äîthe list goes on. Speaking for me, I came from a ‚Äòmiddle-class OBC Muslim‚Äô family. I mentioned ‚ÄòOBC‚Äô specifically because I registered as a ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô category student for the JEE. Blinded by the ‚Äòanti-reservation, meritocratic‚Äô ideals during my 12th class, I stubbornly gave up my ‚ÄòOBC‚Äô reservation. Only in my second year, when I took SOC 171, did I come to know that I was a perfect fit to be called coming from OBC category. My parents tried their best to provide me with the best education, but at the same time, they didn‚Äôt have enough to spend on luxuries. Even though they always encouraged me to take coaching for JEE if I needed it, I knew it would be tough for them and hence didn‚Äôt take it. Things worked well for me, but now looking back, here In IITK, I had friends on both sides of the spectrum: far more privileged than me and far less privileged as well. And we should appreciate this diversity. And I strongly encourage you to learn from your peers, be it any skill like dancing or music OR any viewpoint of theirs on any topic.",
      "Be open to new experiences and viewpoints. Recognizing that the ground is not level for all, everyone here is fighting their own battle. And all of you are doing well, appreciate it.",
      "‚ÄúLove more, Judge less‚Äù. At times we have this feeling, ‚ÄòHow cool is their friend group? ‚ÄòWhy are my friends not like that?‚Äô. I myself thought at times, Why are we not doing what this or that group is doing? We get swayed by the conventional definitions of being cool. Prominently in the final year, there‚Äôs this convention of coolness judged by how often you get ‚Äòbhand‚Äô, how often you do ‚Äòcrazy things‚Äô, and how often you do ‚Äòparties‚Äô. My group was majorly the sober one. We found solace in random walks to OAT and Mama Mio; we loved to spend the nights sitting together, roasting each other, cherishing the memories, and singing random poetry, shayari, and songs. Fitting the conventional definitions is good if you are enjoying it, since along with fun, you will not be feeling FOMO. However, keep your FOMO aside if you like something else and go do it. Don‚Äôt simply try to avoid existing friends that you vibe with in the search for conventionally ‚Äòcooler friends‚Äô.",
      "‚ÄòTime hi kahaan milta, assignments karne hote, classes hain, thoda fursat mile, phir karte hain start‚Äô. We get so busy being successful that we forget why did we start all this in the first place. Constantly neglecting health and putting it at the end of the queue took a toll. And whatever you achieve, if you are engulfed by a multitude of diseases, it won‚Äôt be of any help. During the lockdown period, my weight peaked at 100 kg. I suffered from severe back pain and digestive problems from constant sitting in front of the laptop screen. At some point, I was diagnosed with hypertension and was on pills for 3‚Äì4 months. I decided to prioritize my health. I had shed 18 kg by the time the 8th semester ended. If you are in good shape, well, that‚Äôs good; try to maintain it. If not, it‚Äôs never too late to begin.",
      "Looking backwards, I can see that throughout my college life, I was in constant search for the source of happiness. A small part of this search was my exploration throughout college of different mystic schools such as Sufism, Taoism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and the list goes on. I thought the academic achievements would be the source, but they weren‚Äôt. I thought the applause we get from people for our achievements would be enough, but it wasn‚Äôt. I thought luxury might be it, but it wasn‚Äôt. I thought ‚Äògood things continuously happening‚Äô to us would be the source, confusing still, it wasn‚Äôt. Happiness lies in accepting the fact that there is ‚Äúno goal to be achieved in this life‚Äù.",
      "There is no ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. ‚ÄúLife in itself, your being present at the moment, being here and now, is the goal‚Äù.",
      "That being said, appreciate the moment, appreciate the people around you who love you, who you love, appreciate what all life has thrown at you, and appreciate that in this infinite cosmos of time and space, you were given an opportunity to ‚Äòexist‚Äô, to be ‚Äòalive‚Äô. But as it is said, knowledge and wisdom are very different. I won‚Äôt claim to have achieved supremacy in this art. There‚Äôs still a long way to go on the path I have described.",
      "But still, it‚Äôs perfect, the moment is perfect. Your being here and reading this now is perfect.",

      "Lying alone in my hostel room in the summer after my 4th year, I finally felt the entirety of the weight that the phrases so commonly flung at us during orientation carried ‚Äì that our friends were our new ‚Äò‚Äòfamily‚Äù and the campus our ‚Äúhome‚Äù. I remember sitting on a little stool using Simran‚Äôs bed as a table, with her and Sampada at their desks, and we would all study in silence, passing snacks around. This was home. I would barge into Muskan‚Äôs room whenever I felt like it, and we would talk away our worries. This was home. I would return from the lab and go straight to Manoti‚Äôs room, where I would always find a few other ‚ÄòWingies‚Äô involved in a ‚Äòbulla session‚Äô, maybe even Sampada making coffee at the desk. This was home. I would go to hall 5, chat with my friends at the canteen, drag them out to play frisbee and then relax with a movie. These mundane moments spent with friends have made the past five years warm and comfortable and made it possible for the big, uncomfortable, yet exciting ones to happen.",
      "",
      "I remember my first-ever volleyball match in Udghosh. Our ‚ÄòB team‚Äô, consisting of only first-year students, stood on the court, terrified, after just a month of learning the sport. We obviously lost, but the adrenaline rush and team spirit were exhilarating. The bonds I‚Äôve made and the experiences I‚Äôve had with the team are very close to my heart. The long journeys in UPSRTC buses in peak winter where we‚Äôd huddle up for warmth, hitchhiking on a random truck while eating stolen sugarcane, the pre-match strategy meetings, the cheering (and anti-cheering) at inter-IIT games, the stretching and massages after long days of practice during camps and the dumb-c games at birthday celebrations. Volleyball was a big part of my first three semesters here. The one good thing about women‚Äôs sports at IITK is that there truly are no prerequisites for joining most teams. Sadly, this leads to a few downsides, mainly that the level you are expected to strive for is very low. Whenever I tried to do something beyond that, I got yelled at and shot down. This made things stressful, prompting me to discontinue after my second inter-IIT. Despite my complaints, it was a great experience, and I‚Äôm very grateful for the friendships I forged through it.",
      "The BSBE department had a relatively small batch size, and we were close-knit. Our professors were also friendly for the most part, and our lab courses were a lot of fun ‚Äì we must have been a nuisance to the TAs, blowing up gloves and playing with solution mixers, but we had a blast. However, the coursework focussed more on the qualitative and theoretical aspects of the field, while I was more interested in the engineering aspects. Being unable to work in a lab and the general disinterest of my peers and professors during the pandemic left me quite uninspired, and I decided to switch tracks and explore other fields, which ultimately led me to enrol in a dual degree in mechanical engineering (solid mechanics and design).",
      "This was a major shift into new territory, and it filled me with self-doubt and a fear of failure. Added to that was a change I hadn‚Äôt anticipated to affect me as much. I was now an obvious minority ‚Äì one of the 2-3 girls in a batch of about 120. I felt like an outsider ‚Äì I had no one to discuss complex topics with, had to work twice as hard even to be taken seriously and would often get unprofessional comments and remarks. It was very frustrating when professors and other superiors said I was not fit for something requiring ‚Äúphysical work‚Äù (something as basic as using a screwdriver!). Or when people joked about how I only achieved something because I was a girl, not because I did well. Feeling alienated and alone, I ended up working extremely hard in all of my courses, and while the outcome was positive, it was an unnecessarily stressful experience for a long time. Thankfully, my labmates were welcoming, and eventually, I made friends and got comfortable with the department, but it took much longer than expected. All in all, I am glad I made this decision. It has allowed me to find a field that I enjoy and has opened the door to some fantastic opportunities for my PhD, as my interdisciplinary training and research experience strengthened my application and helped me stand out.",
      "Making this academic shift also gave me the courage to finally step out of my comfort zone in other aspects of my life and try out the things I always wanted to do. When we returned to campus, I saw a poster for a football workshop for girls and went for it. We played in Udghosh after a week of practice. I was a defender and accidentally scored a self-goal in one of the matches. I made the situation worse by getting someone to substitute for me, partly because I was injured and couldn‚Äôt run and partly because I was too embarrassed. At the time, I felt like I could never show my face again, but it passed, and I can laugh about it now. Serendipitously, I was asked to play the violin (thanks, Shreyasi), which I had picked up only two years before, for a song in the Musical Extravaganza ‚Äì it was a tiny part, but I was terrified. It gave me the opportunity to face my debilitating stage fright. I still have a long way to go before I even consider myself a decent musician, but it gave me the will to try, and I learnt a lot from others in the club.",
      "",
      "My time here has given me many memories and new experiences, friends that can make any place feel like home, the courage to try new things and the courage to fail and learn from it. Looking back, I can see that I have changed a lot from my first-year self. I have met seniors, batchmates and juniors who are terrific at what they do, and it has indeed been a humbling and inspiring experience. If there‚Äôs anything that you want to take away from my story, it is to try out the things that you want to, even if they scare you to death. If you can‚Äôt do it alone, ask for help and support. It will probably be an uncomfortable experience ‚Äì you might actually be horrible at it and make many mistakes. But it will be worth the satisfaction and all the other things you will learn from the process. And what‚Äôs the worst that could happen which can‚Äôt be laughed off?",
      "‚ÄúLIFE HAPPENS WHEREVER YOU ARE, WHETHER YOU MAKE IT OR NOT.‚Äù",
      "I hope you, too, have (or had) a great time here and make the most out of what IITK has to offer.",
      "",
      "P.S. I want to express my gratitude to the incredible professors that I have had the opportunity to interact with and learn from. Some of my courses have genuinely changed the way I think. I am also fortunate to have a family that has supported my decisions (although with concerns). It has been crucial to my sanity, especially during the pandemic. Last but not least, I am glad I met all my friends, old and new (not all are in these pictures). Their presence has genuinely enriched my time here.",

      "Shashank Katiyar is a Y19 BSBE graduate. In his AWL he narrates the interesting experiences and adventures that he has had through the 4 years of college life inculcating the important message that one must take every opportunity that life presents in front of them.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Hey folks,",
      "So finally, the time has come. I read a lot of AWLs during my second year and found them really inspiring. At the time, I hoped that I would also end up having a successful and enjoyable campus experience to write in my own AWL. When I sat down to write this, I wasn‚Äôt really sure. I had too much and too little to write; it‚Äôs a strange feeling, really. But if you go by my friends‚Äô word, I have a pretty good story. So hang on for a bit. I hope you enjoy it!",
      "On the evening of July 20, 2019, around 7 pm, I was chilling at home (probably playing Age of Empires) when I got a call from my SG, Shivam Goel (if someone had told me that SG is just his initials, I would have totally believed him). He asked about my whereabouts on the call, as I had to report to IITK that day. I was totally unaware of the date of reporting and didn‚Äôt even try to know it beforehand, as my home is only 6 km away from campus, and I was prepared to go to campus on demand. Though I had just managed to make it to IITK Earth Sciences (later, I would change it to BSBE, by process of elimination), I was extremely happy to be a part of the fantastic IITK community and really proud of myself for having cleared the JEE exam without any coaching. I also had grand plans of thoroughly enjoying the next four years of my life, as I obviously knew for a fact that ‚ÄúIIT pahuch jaao fir to life set hai.‚Äù Really wish it was true.",
      "As strange as it may sound, I wanted to come to IITK ASAP because I wanted to play badminton for the first time on an indoor court. And boy, did I fulfill my wish. I got through the badminton CPA trials and played a massive amount of badminton with my buddy Devang during the first year. I wanted to represent IITK in the Inter IITs, but it‚Äôs a story with a sad ending.",
      "Academically, I put in the bare minimum and was content with being average. My main goal was to enjoy my college life, make lifelong friends, and play badminton.",
      "One of the most fun nights of my stay here came in the first semester in the form of the treasure hunt conducted by the MNC council. Though my wingies weren‚Äôt initially in the mood for it, I pushed them to come with me. Getting through the qualifying scavenger hunt was simple. I simply sent the list of items to my home, and all the items were brought to us üòõ",
      "The actual treasure hunt began after that‚Ä¶",
      "The first question took us ages to solve, and we were almost about to give up. But then, some help from our baapus got us going. Throughout the night, we circled the campus many times, visiting places we hadn‚Äôt even heard of before, ending up at the swimming pool at sunrise, which was the final location to reach.",
      "The brainstorming involved in getting through each question was just exhilarating. We came second by a small margin, but it was a night to be remembered for long.",
      "In the second semester, I didn‚Äôt study just like the first one, but due to covid, the semester was stopped midway, and only the performance up to midsem was considered. That really hurt me academically, getting me an SPI of 6.9. It was a wake-up call. Then came COVID.",
      "Though Covid took all the hostel fun away, initially, it felt blissful, at least to me. It was the ideal summer vacation with no courses/homework to do and all day to play computer games. I played a lot of Age of Empires during that time. However, I didn‚Äôt notice that my mental health gradually deteriorated, and I became really irritable then. The third semester started in September 2020, and in hindsight, the time between March to September 2020 was a pretty bad phase in my college life.",
      "The third semester gave me something to focus on, a purpose, however superficial it may be. I worked really hard, something I hadn‚Äôt done for a long time. Gradually, I started focusing on the right things, and though there weren‚Äôt gonna be any results to show for my hard work for a long time, I was doing what I needed and wanted to do on a daily basis. I had always had a love for science, but I didn‚Äôt know for sure if I wanted to pursue research till my 3rd year. Thus, I sat in the SPO intern season and also applied for research interns, the application process of which is very tiresome. After around a month of trying and failing, I left the SPO intern applications and focused completely on research intern applications. Still, I couldn‚Äôt secure a good foreign research internship. Luckily, an IISC Bangalore Professor (Professor Mohit Kumar Jolly, an alumnus of BSBE, IITK) was looking for interns in the field of Computational Biology in December 2021 (at the end of my 5th semester) and basically selected everyone who applied. Thus I finally had something to do in my 3rd-year summer.",
      "We spent three semesters in the online mode, and I developed many good habits during that time, like reading books and meditation. Still, the time spent at home was huge, and all the students longed to return to campus. At the beginning of 2022, the time had finally come for us to return to campus.",
      "Finally, the long wait was over, and on December 30, 2021, I returned to campus to enjoy some more college life. This was the peak time in my college life yet. It was my sixth sem, and I was highly productive and still having immense fun. However, it wouldn‚Äôt last long.",
      "During the mid sem break of the 6th semester, my friends (Jaskirat and Gurbaaz) and I decided to go on a unique vacation. Basically, we wanted a peaceful vacation rather than a hectic one. We went to Vadnagar, a small town near Indore, to meet an IITian couple, Arpit Maheshwari and Sakshi Bhatia, who left their high-paying jobs to do organic farming. We wanted to meet them and get to know a new perspective on things and life in general. The plan was to spend five days with Arpit and Sakshi, then leave for Indore, spend a day there, and return. The first five days were awesome! We interacted with Arpit and Sakshi at a profound level, played many board games together, and helped them with work on their farm, which we enjoyed a lot. We couldn‚Äôt have expected any more from our stay at Vadnagar.",
      "Then, on the 16th of March 2022, we left for Indore to spend the next day there and explore the city. However, things were just about to take a turn for the worse. In Indore, we went to an adventure center called Fundore, and there, after enjoying all the rides, at around 9 pm, we were about to leave the place. Just then, I saw a guy riding skateboard, and I couldn‚Äôt resist going to him and asking him to let me ride it. He gave me a small demonstration, and then I tried to imitate. As soon as I kept both of my feet on the board, my whole world flipped, and I fell on my right arm, all my body weight falling on my right forearm, breaking my radius bone into two and my ulna into three parts. I could hear my bones break at the moment and saw my hand get deformed. I was shattered, quite literally. I begged Jaski and Gurbaaz to hold my hand as I couldn‚Äôt lift it, and we rushed to the nearest hospital, where an X-ray was done. My family doctor advised me to get a temporary plaster done there and return to Kanpur as it was better to conduct the operation in Kanpur.",
      "I returned to Kanpur the next day, on 17th March, and the operation was scheduled for the 19th, as the 18th was Holi.",
      "Post-operation, a few days were very bad, both physically and mentally. I had caused permanent damage to my body; the bones would never return to their normal strength. I, who once wanted to play as many sports as possible, now had a half-capable body. Badminton wasn‚Äôt an available option now. Sometimes, life itself performs the elimination process for us- instead of sports, I would spend my time playing musical instruments and studying now. I survived this period thanks to the song Waqt ki Baatein by Dream Note.",
      "I did the remaining part of that semester by doing up-down daily from home. During this time, I had almost fully made up my mind about pursuing higher studies after B.tech from some foreign country (as I really wanted to visit new places), and that too, MS rather than Ph.D., as Ph.D. is a really big commitment which I didn‚Äôt want to make. Thus, during my 7th semester, along with getting exposure to the field of computational biology, I started applying for master‚Äôs in the same in European and American colleges.",
      "The master‚Äôs application process is nothing less than a challenge. I started shortlisting Universities in July 2022, and varying suggestions led me to keep on modifying it till November. In August, I gave the GRE and TOEFL and began working on my Statement of purpose. It took three months to get it into good shape. Apart from this, preparing the CV, arranging the LORs, and filling up the applications was a lot of work. It is always advised to be proactive with these things, and so was I, except‚Ä¶",
      "The application deadline for one of my top priority colleges, ETH Zurich, was 15 December. I had to prepare a pre-proposal of my thesis for it and had it ready by the 14th night. I just wanted the feedback of my intern mentor on it, after which I would submit my otherwise complete application. However, my meeting with him on the 14th night was postponed. The next day, there was an electricity shortage, and coincidentally, my laptop, which usually has some charge, was completely discharged. Still, I was relaxed as I just had to submit the application, which would hardly take 5 minutes, and I had many hours before the deadline (midnight). Electricity was back at around 5 pm, I opened my laptop to submit the application.",
      "Guess what? The deadline was 12 noon and not midnight, which is extremely rare, and I had missed it by a whisker as noon in Europe translates to around 5 pm in India. I know it sounds really careless from my side, and it was too, but luck too wasn‚Äôt on my side that day. It took me a few days to console myself after that. I just hoped to get accepted by some other University and be able to say later that this incident saved me the application cost for ETH Zurich (12k rupees). Well, I did end up saving that money üòõ",
      "My priority applications were completed by mid-December 2022, and I was ready to apply to lower-priority colleges whose deadlines were generally in January, as I was skeptical about getting into any of my top-priority colleges. However, on 10th January, I woke up to the most thrilling news. I had been accepted into Carnegie Mellon University, my top priority school! I was beyond elated. Whatever I had done till this point had finally paid off, thanks to many, most importantly, the help from my friends, professors under whom I had worked, and my internship mentor, who helped me a ton during the applications.",
      "Then, the last semester was all about making memories and studying just to not fail. My hand had recovered pretty well now, so I played a lot of games (pool, badminton, and cricket) and also learned to play flute and kalimba.",
      "One awesome thing that I did during the last semester was to take Mainak Das Sir‚Äôs course, Design for Biosecurity. It was being offered for the first time, and thus there were only around 25 of us in the course, many from BSBE, whom I already knew. It was the most fun course in all of my stay at IITK. Listening to Sir is just like listening to any interesting podcast, and he would make the class extremely interactive by asking us a lot of logical questions. We also partied during the class twice, and since we were all 4th years, the vibe throughout was just fantastic.",
      "Looking back, my overall experience at IITK was magnificent. There were many ups and downs, many shots I took, and many more that I missed or didn‚Äôt take, but it all made the story more interesting and life more worthwhile. Most of my decisions were made through the elimination process, which was possible only because I tried a lot of things. I learned and improved a lot here and had the best time of my life along with it!",
      "A final word for whoever is reading- My most important learning in IITK, which came from my buddy Pranjal, was the following:",
      "Often, we make a habit of saying no to certain activities, justifying to ourselves that we don‚Äôt like them. However, just ask yourself if you have ever made a genuine attempt at it. If the answer is no, don‚Äôt lie to yourself by saying you don‚Äôt like it. Instead, simply accept that you don‚Äôt feel like doing it at that moment. This way, you will increase your chances of actually giving it a try another day, and maybe you will fall in love with it!",
      "Thank you for reading!",

Read on to know more about his adventures in college sprinkled with some regrets and advice for the juniors.",

      "TBH I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to write a typical As We Leave but here I am, giving my vague attempt to it, I will try not to give you BT this time (those who follow me on insta know what I mean) : *Drumrolls*",
      "So it all began about 5 years back, Yes you read it write ‚Äú5‚Äù Years back ( I swear, this time I am not high, or maybe I am üòâ ). You can classify me as Y18.5 since I am living on the campus since the Y18s but I am a Y19. (Long story in short, I am a preparatory course student ‚Äì I will not go into detail yeh kya hota hai, but you can find it out on your own to meet some interesting & weird personalities on the campus).",
      "I was very homesick when I had come here, the only reason I didn‚Äôt go to Kota for coaching was because I didn‚Äôt want to leave my home. Neither my parents nor I would have thought at that time that I will be able to survive here but interestingly it turned out the opposite. I didn‚Äôt even get to know when I got adjusted on the campus so much so that I never wanted to go home. The Preparatory Course year was very good, the academic load was very less in comparison to the first year. I made some good friends ‚Äì Dilip, Subhash, Lochan, Jay, Kripendra, and my roommate Rajkumar. I enjoyed a lot in this year , we were given accommodation in Hall 13, and all my other wingies were Y18s so I got to know a lot about first year and campus culture from them, I actively participated in everything that happens for a fresher, so what if those things were not for us ( at that time I got to know fest/Club/Cell walo ke liye Mazdoori aur zihadi ke liye koi batch nhi hota ) .",
      "We hadn‚Äôt had any orientation and nobody had introduced us to the campus culture so some very interesting incidents happened with me.",
      "No.1: I participated in one of the takneek SNT Code fillers, and on stage I addressed one of the seniors as Bhaiya ( according to the general timeline, till this time if you are calling someone as bhaiya/didi, normal fresher to gya) , then he asked me in a rude tone ki ‚ÄúBaap kon hai ?‚Äù and I replied with a puppy face ‚Äúnhi pta‚Äù, then he didn‚Äôt say anything, all he had was mercy for me.",
      "No.2: During Ritambhara , I was a volly. I was asked to check everyone‚Äôs ID at the faculty/sponsor gate and direct them toward their seat. Everything was going smoothly but suddenly a man came with 3-4 people and I asked him for his ID, a person with him shouted, ‚Äúpta hai kis se Id maang rahe ? ‚Äú and that man passed a smile and went inside. He was our Director Sir!! Come on what more daring thing can you do?",
      "So prep year passed smoothly, I passed and we were given a long break and then the first year started.",
      "I found Orientation and SG sessions very boring because I already knew all those things. (This is one of the reasons I was not able to bond much with my wingies and SG.) I had got to learn a few things about first year college life by observing my wingies in prep year like scoring 10 CPI is a next to impossible task, avg CPI is around 7, no matter how much you try you will not understand MTH101, and that you have to pass courses by pulling off a nightout before the exam. All of this ‚Äúextra knowledge‚Äù that I had were enough to destroy my first sem‚Äôs CPI because I always tried for a 7 pointer, never tried to understand mth101 ,and never went to classes. If you‚Äôll ask my biggest achievement in college, it is passing MTH101 in the first attempt, although I got a D!!",
      "Bacche",
      "D3 Wing",
      "Freshers ‚Äì Fine arts Club",
      "My first sem was kind of lonely too because all of my prep friends got separated, my wingies became my seniors and started acting a little weird. I was not able to bond with my wingies so I used to hang out with the Telugu friend circle of my roomie. I wanted to make my separate place on this campus and I wanted people to know me, so I started making memes and started social media bakchodiya. I ended up making myself a lot of acquaintances but not a single friend. Through this I realized it is very easy to make acquaintances in IITK but very difficult to make friends and there is no place lonelier than social media.",
      "Then the Second Semester started, but just before the start I had my first breakup which completely destroyed my mental health, I remained in my room most of the time for the next two months, but then I thought of improving. I again started making memes and conducted Y19 ki Buaa ke election, it was fun. As I was coming out of my isolation, we had our midsem break and then COVID came. I remember making fun of one of my wingie who was purchasing mask for travelling in a train but I never could‚Äôve thought that I will see everyone around me in masks for the next 2 years. All my efforts of improving my mental health went in vain, it got worse. I started keeping myself locked in a room for the whole day, I didn‚Äôt talk to my parents and I stopped studying. My escape from this situation was the depressed meme that I upload on social media. I had learnt that if you start making fun of your problem then somehow it becomes a little bearable. I was desperate to go to the campus but every time there was a -ve news. When finally I got a chance in RC to go to campus, I didn‚Äôt, since I knew that I haven‚Äôt studied for a long time and I will not be able to pass offline exams(if happened). When I look back at this period of my life, I am proud of myself that I survived it but I regret that I could have utilized that period to gain some skills & spend some time with my family. So, no matter how hard the situation is, always look for what best you can do!!",
      "Then after a gap of 3.5 semesters we got a chance to return back to campus. This time I had the pressure of covering up for the time that I had wasted in COVID, of making new friends and memories ,and of getting an intern and a placement.",
      "My experience with Counselling Service",
      "One of the best things that I found about IITK is its family culture‚Ä¶ Amma, Baapu, Dada, Nani etc. The first time I dreamt of taking any POR in the campus, it was of Counselling service Core team Ops. I always wanted to become a part of CS but never thought I would even become an SG (but I became one.) I don‚Äôt know if was a good Baapu or not but after becoming one, the respect I had for my Baapu increased in my heart. I found out it was not an easy task and at the same time I also learned a lot of things ( you get to see life from a different perspective and while listening to your bachchas problems you find your own problems small and sometimes you find solutions to your own problem while helping them.)",
      "But becoming a part of the core team was certainly out of sight. Still, I filled the form and cleared 2 rounds, and suddenly a confidence jumped in and I started believing that I can be a part of the core team but then in the 3rd round I realized that I couldn‚Äôt since my CPI was too low for CS head and Counsellors (who took my Round 3) üôÇ . After the final round result, I was shattered because I didn‚Äôt know what else I was good at, I didn‚Äôt apply for any other POR for the next 2 months. But When I look back I don‚Äôt regret it. If that day I wouldn‚Äôt have got rejected I would‚Äôve never become EC Manager or Techkriti Festival Coordinator. With this¬†incident, my belief in this beautiful line of poetry even became stronger ‚ÄúKuch galat bhi ho jane do, Geet ko bhi Aditya train chutne par hi mila tha‚Äù. I also want to quote one more line from the same poetry‚Äúnahi milta jo kho jata hai. Kyunki khoya woh nahi jo tum paa na sake. Khoya toh woh hai jo kuch aur pane ke hord mein tumne gava diya ‚Äú.It is nice if you get it, and it is nice even if you don‚Äôt get it, just don‚Äôt miss out other things while regretting that, because college life is too short for that.",
      "Now to a question that came to my mind many times, I finally found an answer‚Ä¶.",
      "Does POR lend you a Job ?",
      "I have met two kinds of people on the campus, one who were strictly against holding any POR, they find it a waste of time and the other who think that getting a ‚Äúgood POR‚Äù gets a you ‚Äúgood job‚Äù. But I disagree with both. POR never gets you a job but the skills that you develop, the connections that you make and the experiences that you gain help you get a job. POR helps you learn management and experience teamwork in college itself, make a lot of good friends, to understand how things work in real life and how the administration and things work in the college.",
      "One thing that I would like to point out is the big shift in the POR culture from my first year, right now people don‚Äôt want to hold any POR and those who are holding it are either doing it just for making their resume look better or for the so-called status/power. I can‚Äôt see the spark, the passion or the respect for these prestigious positions anymore.",
      "My remaining time in college just passed so quick, I can‚Äôt even remember. First Elections‚Äô22 then Techkriti‚Äô22 then intern then placements then Techkriti‚Äô23, it just all happened in a blink. Ahhh how can I proceed forward without sharing my Techkriti experience with you all.",
      "After being Design head in Techkriti‚Äô22 and EC Manager I decided to spend my fourth year with some few close friends in some corner of Hall 9. Initially, I wanted to apply for CEO but later I dropped that plan and to get it straight I had never thought of becoming a festi because I didn‚Äôt find myself capable of that position until the moment Karan, Ex Festi asked me, ‚ÄúWould you apply for the Festi post ?‚Äù That single question and Karan‚Äôs trust in me motivated me to go through the rough interview process and the journey of a festi. I would never say it was a fairy tale, sometimes I had to become the villain in the team, sometimes I found myself crying alone that I had fucked up everything, sometimes I had to sacrifice my friends and",
      "fourth-year life, sometimes I didn‚Äôt know what to do next but what kept me motivated was the image of my team which had put in a lot of efforts and sacrificed what not for this single fest, and I could not allow their efforts and sacrifice to go in vain.",
      "I am really thankful to Team Techkriti‚Äô22 and Techkriti‚Äô23 and Mohit (aka Pandey Ji) for being always there for me and for giving me the best memories of my life, molding me into who I am today.",
      "As I pause to reflect back on my journey, I feel I have done almost everything from getting an intern and placement to going on an iconic goa trip to successfully conducting Techkriti‚Äô23 to dating someone to sitting in Aston Martin (Flex101), all of which had seemed impossible at some point in time.

      "I could have done better with my academics, but I never tried actually. ( realized this thing in my last two semesters)",
      "There are a lot of research facilities and exciting projects going on across various labs, but I never took a project under a prof.",
      "I wanted to join HSS and Dramatics Club but never joined it.",
      "I never explored SnT clubs and any of the sports here at IITK.",

      "Some advice for my juniors :",
      "Always buy a cooler, sounds weird but I met my two best friends Yatish and Govind because of cooler.",
      "Avoid trying any kind of ‚Äústuff‚Äù in the first or second year, (for those who know me I know it sounds ironical from my mouth ), there is a right time for everything‚Ä¶ for such things, you have third and fourth year but things that you can do and explore in your first year cannot be done in 3/4th year.",
      "Never fear trying anything new, do everything that you always wanted to do, do as many mistakes as you can do, because college is the place to learn and prepare yourself for life ahead.",
      "Always discuss your problems with your seniors and batchmates, because we always feel that our problem is unique but there is that fixed list of problems that is faced by our generation and there is a very high chance that the problem you are dealing with is faced by someone else around you.",
      "I heard lot of people complaining about lot of things and comparing our college with other college in different things like fest , Inter IIT , placements etc.Complaining doesn‚Äôt help. I know a single person can‚Äôt solve all the problems but a single person can solve a single problem and together we can solve all the problems.",
      "Try to interact with as many people as you can, not only your batchmates but also seniors, professors, various staff, SIS guards, mess workers, etc. and always try to be kind to everyone because sometimes we don‚Äôt know what the other person is dealing with.",
      "Keep different kinds of people in your friend circle. From A Maggu friend to a Nashedi friend, because each person teaches you something different.",
      "Don‚Äôt chase people and lower your self esteem for getting someone because that doesn‚Äôt help. I know it sounds a classy cliche line but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learnt about relationships at the end, in a very hard way.",
      "And lastly, spend time with real people rather than spending time binge-watching and on social media.",

      "Vasundhara Rai is a Y19 graduate. In this piece, she tells us about the various stages of adulting she experienced as a student of IIT Kanpur. Read on to find about her inspirational journey, be it academics, her time in CS & Prayas or about how she navigated her diverse career interests, and how all of this equipped her to face the real world",
      "From July 20th, 2019 when every person in that Shatabdi train‚Äôs coach appeared to me as if going to IIT Kanpur, to May 10th, 2023 when I was struggling to hold back tears as my mind was registering these 4 years in the happiest, most adventurous corner of my memory, IITK has changed me for good. (Parents might disagree since my sleep schedule is quite messed up :P). So welcome and thank you for joining me on this journey today as I reminisce about how my life and decisions twisted and turned a flustering number of times (Research -UPSC- Consulting) until it all fell beautifully into place as my stay at campus concluded. Due to my involvement with the Counselling Service, I was blessed with the prospect of interacting with multiple juniors, many of whom came up to me looking for solutions to their problems. This AWL has somewhat evolved out of those conversations and I would be so glad if it brings some new perspective for the readers as well",
      "A smile appears on my face every time I think of those ‚Äì ‚Äúcover the gaps‚Äù, ‚Äúbring your umbrellas and pink folders‚Äù, headcount, mafia nights, and sessions at Audi. Life was good, life was fast. It was a lot of freedom all at once. The days flew by surprisingly quickly ‚Äì felt like you woke up, went to classes, had a chat with friends, and went back to sleep. With so many clubs to explore, multiple bulla sessions (all of which felt so important to attend due to FOMO), and not to mention Acads, I was struggling to make ends meet (was also a part of the Basketball and Athletics team). As a result, my first semester hit a 6.3 SPI. I remember traveling in the metro when the email came, and I felt dead inside.",
      "For me, at least, it was very difficult to say no to an event, a bulla session, or a spontaneous outing plan, I still struggle but those random things which might seem very important at that time, might not appear as big of a deal when you look back at it.It‚Äôs all about quality vs quantity.",
      "So thus began our second semester, I was determined to do well this time around, and I did pretty well. Soon we were about to leave for our 10 days of midsem break, but boy oh boy, did we know it would turn into 2 years that would go down in the history of mankind as not only a period of huge despair but also the saga of what humans can achieve when in cahoots with each other. A day before the break, we were shown our MTH102 midsem scripts. A question was left unchecked, and thus I gave it for re-grading. But that question never got re-graded, and I received a B in MTH102. A friend told me that I had lost an A by just a few marks, so I decided to appear for the re-exam. After multiple cautionary emails from the Prof, most students had withdrawn their re-exam request, but I didn‚Äôt. Worst possible decision! I was also running for the Hall 6 presidential elections at that time. The day of the re-exam coincided with that of the elections. None of the students were able to improve their grades, and guess what, my grade went from a B to a D. The Hall 6 elections were another fun experience. I had always been in a very close circle during my first year, and thus gathering support from people you never talked to was a difficult task. Although I lost in the end, the difference in the number of votes was marginal, contrary to my expectations. At the same time, as the first-year summers began, I took up multiple SnT projects and a research project under a professor. You see, I had always found myself gravitating more towards biology than mathematics, and thus I was contemplating research as my long-term plan (although UPSC was something that I had always aspired for since I was 10).",
      "Hall 6 elections turned me from a person who would shy away from talking to people to one who actively puts in the effort to initiate conversations with more and more people while respecting one‚Äôs own mental bandwidth at the same time. I am glad that I took more on my plate than what I could handle during my first and second-year summers since otherwise, I would have had nothing on my resume (as you would see through my 3rd-year involvements). I was also challenging myself by not following my rudimentary action plan of preparing for UPSC and rather trying my hands at research since IITK offers you a plethora of options to choose from which no other place might provide, and thus with an ample amount of time in hand, you might not wish to miss experiencing them at least once.",
      "You identify yourself as something due to performing an activity several times. Once that happens, your subconscious mind makes it your go-to habit. So you see, just as an example ‚Äì even after being a night owl for so long, pushing myself into waking up early a few times and believing that I was a morning person actually transformed me into that person.‚ÄúEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become‚Äù‚Äì Atomic Habits by James Clear. I still follow my workout schedule almost religiously. It has turned into a habit that helps me to ground myself mentally and have that self-talk.",
      "During the fourth semester and the summer following it, I joined Prayas and Counselling Service. The people I met in these two organizations have been my home away from home. I remember when the college finally reopened and I met the children at Prayas face to face. Every time I returned from there, Nandini (my go-to person since we met, CS buddy also roommate for a brief amount of time) would be quick to mention how my face would be beaming. And why not, one would get instantly humbled by the amount of affection those kids possess to shower at you. Counselling Service was another boon as I got to work with the sweetest people and met so many juniors, conversations with whom have evolved into this AWL. Meanwhile, I constantly kept myself busy with any opportunities that came my way and tried to achieve those small wins",
      "if you are someone like me who completely got derailed after JEE and the first 2 semesters at the campus, it‚Äôs important to decide the person you want to be and prove it to yourself with those small wins. The confidence they provide is what drives you for the bigger ones. Internships are a tough spot for almost all the people and at that moment, it is crucial to keep your energy up and directed.You are never rude or wrong if you try to cut some things off to save up your energy and mental space. Save it for that one buddy who genuinely roots for you, hold them tight, and support each other through this tide.",
      "Third-year summers were fun. AbInBev is a pretty cool place with super nice people. I received a PPO from there, but as the summers ended, approached the placement heat. Till then I had come across a new term via seniors ‚Äì ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù. The job profile seemed very dynamic ‚Äì something I crave and it seemed like they might be coming for placements during December, unlike their usual August visits. The Paradox of Choice ‚Äì I was utterly confused since working at MBB and then going for UPSC didn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea. I was weighing their pros and cons. Thus comes a very favorite question by juniors to me ‚ÄìUPSC or placements?",
      "Talking to a lot of people helps butthe answer that you need will come from within. I can‚Äôt even remember how many people I talked to ‚Äì fellow batchmates preparing for UPSC, seniors at MBB, and IAS officers. But none of them was going to make the choice for me. After a lot of days, in fact, months thinking about it, I finally decided to prepare for MBB. You may think a thousand times before you make a decision, but after taking that decision, you need to stick to it no matter what or else it will take you nowhere. I won‚Äôt lie and say it was an easy ride. As the seventh semester went on and I practiced cases, I had several episodes of breakdown, doubting if my resume was good or when the cases didn‚Äôt go well and I would wonder if I missed my May 2023 UPSC attempt due to a foolish decision. But I persevered.",
      "Dec 1, 2022, was a very interesting day. It also had a certain amount of thrill to it as you saw people running from one interview to the other, looking so put together in their blazers, friends supporting each other, you couldn‚Äôt tell the time. The energy, the chaos, the emotions, as if the time had been frozen. I gave 2 back-to-back interviews with Bain, 1 with BCG and then with Nandini, Palak, Imad and Aryash beside me, I awaited any further information for as long as an hour. Some people told me to go and give interviews for other consulting companies where I was shortlisted but somehow, I didn‚Äôt care about them anymore. It was either Bain, BCG or UPSC. Soon, I got called for one last interview with Bain, which might have lasted only 7-10 minutes and ended with Pranjal (Bain partner) offering me Thaggu ke laddo saying ‚ÄúCongratulations, we would love to give you an offer‚Äù. That moment was surreal, as my mind was registering what had just happened, I had lost any understanding of what to do when someone hands you a Ladoo!",
      "Time since Dec 1, just flew by. My goal was to meet as many people and have as much fun as I could. And I think last semester could not have been spent any better. Another thing I am super grateful to have come across is UHV (Universal human values). It‚Äôs an 8-day long workshop conducted by NSS almost every semester at the Outreach auditorium and proposes a very fresh perspective on life. I would highly recommend attending one of these workshops and if you wish to know more about it, feel free to ping me anytime.",
      "The weather really blessed our last days at campus. It‚Äôs not until you leave the campus that you realize how bad you will miss that rain coming into your room through the window, watching sunset from a rooftop, getting mesmerized as you sip your coffee at CCD and view the sun setting beside the Library, trees looking more red and yellow than green in color, looking forward to Friday dinner‚Äôs gulab jamun, 3AM visits to DOAA canteen, talking about random topics as you walk all night round the campus, Methi malai paneer at Hall1 canteen, walking all alone early in the morning with the intention to be fully present in the moment, racing your cycle to the beats of some random new song (reader‚Äôs discretion advised, drive slow, drive safe :P), dancing your heart out during fest and appearing for the quiz next morning, speculating about grades before every exam, glaring at ants as they eat away your stack of chocolates, meeting those lovely friends of yours during meals, going for a run after it has rained, having that last game of poker with the CS family and saying ‚ÄúAre hm to milte rhenge‚Äù as all of them leave one by one.",
      "That night of 10th May, it was time to leave. After me, my father and Nandini finished dinner, I suggested going to the Chocolate Room, followed by a walk around the campus. As we passed by the OAT, halls, academic area, Basketball court, CS office, I was introducing all of those places to dad, but my mind was somewhere else. In my head, that 4-year-long cassette rewound as I saw those buildings where once my dreams had turned into reality, now being a witness to my memories",
      "Life moves on, we all will, but it would never offer the same amount of freedom, fun and time with friends as it did at IITK. So, staying very present in every moment is all we can do as life unfolds and folds every chapter of our journey. I‚Äôll forever be grateful to this place and the people I met here. Thank you so much for everything and may the force be with you!",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I had never been on overnight school trips, never had a night stay and almost always was raised in a protected environment in a gated society in the comforts of my hometown. My father, since my childhood had emphasized on the importance of living on one‚Äôs own in a hostel away from home to get a refresher on how the real-world works, and how one needs to conduct themselves to make the most of their time. As I graduate, I really must thank my dad for pushing me into this experience.",
      "When my parents went back after my first day of orientation, I walked a long road back to my Hall 13 room with tears flowing down my cheeks. I wasn‚Äôt particularly sad, hurt, or disappointed, I was just not prepared for what was coming my way and was for the first time in uncharted territory. This was the first time I was going to live away from family, in a place I had no prior exposure to and no local family to fall back to. My younger brother sent me the link to 2 States (which has long been one of my favorite movies) to remind me of how I should make the most of my college life now. But what was college life for me when I started my journey?",
      "It was tough.",
      "If you‚Äôve never learnt how to swim, once you‚Äôre thrown into the violent waters ‚Äì your fight or flight responses start to kick in. And while the Bollywood fanboy inside me had this surreal ambition of leaving a mark on this place with every bit of my filmy personality, I realized that showering each morning and turning up to classes wearing a pair of fancy jeans wasn‚Äôt going to cut it. This place is brutal. The first year is a complete upheaval of whatever your definition of ‚Äònormal routine‚Äô is, and there is no comfort other than what your huge ego might supplement once you step outside of the campus as an ‚ÄòIIT student‚Äô. Waking up each morning, having a shower(?), getting breakfast, actually attending each class, making notes, rushing for lunch back and then hurrying your way to whichever lab you‚Äôve got due next, PE classes in the evening and then extra-curriculars in whatever time you‚Äôve left. All of this seems like a checklist, and you probably will think that one can possibly get done with most (if not all) of these if they put their energy to it, but all the above is what is explicit. There is such a huge dynamic shift; that all of this comes with certain implied norms and notions ‚Äì what you wear to classes, do you have breakfast alone in the morning or do you have friends alongside in the mess for each meal, are your grades slipping down ‚Äì and are you really worth your JEE rank, what extra-curriculars are important, how many are important? Is being friends with the other sex a big deal? How do you make new friends? How relevant are you in your wing, do seniors know you? Are you liked?",
      "No matter how much fun you have in the first week of orientation and how comforted you feel by your student guide and your wingies, once the semester starts, there is one truth that you‚Äôll have to come to terms with ‚Äì IIT doesn‚Äôt care. This institution does not care for who you are and who you were, and unless there is an iota of a chance of whatever you‚Äôre facing breaking out into the national media, the institute won‚Äôt give a flying fuck about you. You‚Äôve got to wake up each morning and stick your feet to the ground and fight your way to carve your presence. No one is going to do it for you.",
      "Picking your people on this campus is of paramount importance. While you lead a very structured life in terms of what courses and how many credits you need to take up and when internships and projects come up; what the people around you help with is more fundamental to how you respond to things that are not structured in life. People are unpredictable, spontaneous, and different, different from what you imagine yourself to be. This is why your peer group helps you deal with situations that you‚Äôve never faced before; it molds you into someone who can be accommodating when needed, and equally rigid and stubborn when required. The people you surround yourself with on campus shape the kind of inter-personal relationships you have in life, and this is probably the most underrated takeaway from the IIT experience. And to remind the first-year version of myself of this for the n-th time,GET OUT ARYAN, GET UNCOMFORTABLE, MAKE FRIENDS, MAKE MEMORIES.",
      "I think towards the latter half of my time here, I felt like I was in a huge conundrum ‚Äì was I still a kid or was I an adult? How do you feel about being someone who has classes to wake up to and homework to solve and at the same time, has the freedom to go out for trips, decides what career might suit them best and struggle for detergent for laundry each week. Adulting hits you out of nowhere towards the latter half of your time here, and navigating the sense of responsibility and ownership gets tricky. IITK however, is the slow part of adulting, and I really love(d) living out this slow part to my fullest. Be careful of your time here, this is the grey hazy segment between [having total control and all estimates of what you want] and [having zero idea of what might come up next and no precedent for what you might face].",
      "Tangibly, my journey at this place was as conventional as it gets, and there probably isn‚Äôt anything that makes it stand apart. But that‚Äôs alright. It was a good time, I met good people and I graduate with a lot of good memories. I‚Äôm happy. It might be a tough pill to swallow, and probably took me close to seven semesters to digest ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to compete with those around you. You‚Äôre here to find your calling and make your presence. And even if you don‚Äôt solve these two things, you have a journey that‚Äôs yours. Reading blogs by seniors and being surrounded by friends who were achieving everything under the sun might give you an initial benchmark of what you‚Äôd like to set out for in terms of your professional career, but this amazing advice I received from an alum that graduated a decade ago was that one is not bound by what has already been accomplished by seniors and friends at IIT, you‚Äôre very well capable of being more, and should look around to know whatever has been done earlier, can very well be done again, but you, you‚Äôre worth pulling off bigger heists than you know of.",
      "I struggle with searching for validation for practically everything I pursue, and it‚Äôs one of the things that has often crippled my social and personal life, but when I finally left campus, I realized that the time I spent here wasMINE. It belonged to me, and I lived it the way I wanted. As I leave, I take with myself a long list of friends that I can invite to my wedding, and hopefully a lot of weddings that I get invited to. I learnt about people, and I also spent time alone. I achieved more than I thought I could, and I failed at so much of what I thought I was capable of. I know the people I met here and the time I spent on this campus is going to always be my most cherished memory, but I‚Äôm confident of moving onto better things. Life‚Äôs going to get better, and I hope everyone reading this takes away at least this one learning I had from my time here ‚ÄìKehte hain, agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho‚Ä¶ toh puri kainaat use tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai.Your life peaks when you want it to, you‚Äôve gone through a lot, you might as well believe for a little more for it to get better.",

      "Where do I even start so many memories and so many lessons, from sleepless tense filled nights to happy night outs. This is me trying to summarize my 4 years of college life, a story of hope.",

      "It all began when the JEE Advanced results were out, and I had to choose my preferred college. My sister advised me that IIT Kanpur was the best choice for me as I was getting computer science here, but I secretly desired to study in Bombay or Delhi, because the city life you experience there would be quite different from that of kanpur. Despite my uncertainty, I trusted her advice and enrolled at IIT Kanpur. Little did I know that my journey to campus would start with a series of mishaps. The train was delayed for a staggering eight hours, leading to the cancellation of our hotel booking. Doubts crept into my mind, and I questioned my decision to join IIT Kanpur.",
      "With half-packed luggage and a mind filled with unanswered questions, I stepped foot on campus, desperately seeking clarity. I didn‚Äôt have a clear goal in mind; all I wanted was to graduate with a good job offer. I felt a mix of fear, excitement, and hope as I embarked on this new adventure. Unfortunately, during orientation, I fell ill and homesickness engulfed me. I missed out on exploring the vibrant campus life, spending most of my first semester glued to my laptop, lost in a virtual world. It was a missed opportunity to join clubs, make new friends, and cherish those late-night discussions and spontaneous hangouts that become treasured memories. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the few friends I made, who stood by me through thick and thin.The first year of college offers countless opportunities to connect with diverse individuals, bond over shared interests, and engage in endless canteen discussions that you‚Äôll look back on fondly. These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my personality. I stumbled upon a group of three friends purely by chance, and together we had passionate debates over oats, enjoyed our casual hangouts at Chickblast, and embarked on frequent trips to ZSquare..",
      "When things were going steady, and slowly things were falling into their place. I left for home, to meet my parents in mid semester break in march and then covid happened, things went haphazard and lockdown was announced. It was difficult, all connections got lost amidst the chaos,but I refused to let it overshadow my college experience.As there was a lot of free time, i picked up my long lost hobby of reading and started watching movies[yep,I am a movie buff], finding solace and new perspectives within their narratives.both these played a huge role in me being sane.",
      "I always believe that whatever the situation may be, a book always gives you a great company and offers you with a whole new perspective of life.",
      "Amidst this, I realized the importance of improving my people skills and decided to step out of my comfort zone. I applied for Public Relations Organizer for Udghosh, unsure of my abilities, and was pleasantly surprised when I was selected . As an introvert,who feels out of place in social situations, becoming a public relations organizer seemed daunting, but with the guidance and support of my head, Jasmine[whom i thank from my bottom of my heart,for believing in me, I took up the challenge. It was a roller coaster ride, from pitching to speakers and organizing back-to-back events to managing unexpected obstacles during them. Those three days of the fest will forever be etched in my memory, teaching me the power of staying calm, giving my best, and overcoming pressure.it is not easy to manage a fest, it takes lot of patience and courage to not break and make things work as planned, people bail out on the last moment, and you need to have backup plans, you need to be polite however rude the other person is to you. All this happened only because I took a leap of faith and chose to work outside my comfort zone. Seniors on campus are always there to guide you, so whenever in doubt try contacting seniors, they had been in your place, they had the same doubts you had, you might feel intimidated to talk to them but trust me everyone on campus is ready to help.",

      "Throughout my journey, I learned that it‚Äôs never too late to start anew¬†and¬†it is pointless to dwell on the past. When the intern season started i was pretty clueless about the process or how to prepare as I had no contacts on campus. By now you must have understood what my almost non existent interaction on campus lead to. My sister was my only source of guidance when the intern season came she warned me beforehand to do some projects because of which i was able to fill my resume pretty decently. To my surprise, I got a interview call from google, and guess what! They liked my resume and my interview was scheduled. That was the moment I realized that to win a game you need to be familiar with the rules the more you are familiar, the more conscious choice you make, i knew that resume plays a big hand and worked on it but I ignored competitive programming because of which I couldn‚Äôt clear the interview. But that rejection from google gave me a confidence boost¬†igniting a fire within me and motivated me to work even harder.¬†I¬†started my intern prep, and everything was going good. In jan 2022¬† we were called back to campus, I was excited to be back on campus and this time I contracted covid. It had a huge impact as my health deteriorated. I could neither focus on my acads to increase my pointer nor my intern prep. I wanted to go home and be with my mom. But, if I went then, I would have be losing out on my career. It was damn difficult, but my mom always supported me. She wanted me to study and be on campus. I managed to crack the Jio internship, but before I could complete my internship and get my first ever paycheck, I lost my mom. It was hard, I was devastated. She was the biggest source of inspiration and my first mentor in life. She was a fighter, she never gave up. I saw her fighting with all her might right till her last days. She always taught me to be independent and fight for the things that I deserved. She was my best friend, and was the coolest mom one could get. Whatever I am today is all because of her influence and teachings.",
      "This was the time, when I was near the cross roads with 2 paths in front of me, accept the pre-placement offer or reject it and sit for placements. My dad didn‚Äôt want me to reject the ppo, he wanted me to take it, but i wanted more and my mom taught me to never settle for less. I again chose the hard path, I rejected my ppo and started my preparations. My placement preparation journey was chaotic, there were days when I badly missed my mom and felt guilty for leaving my grieving father all alone at home and staying here on campus. I was clear of my goal- I will get a job that I deserve. For that, I had to work my ass off to land a decent job. There were days where I felt so hopeless and was on the verge of giving up, but thankfully I was preparing with my friends and it helped a lot. We were able to support each other when one of us was feeling low. There was someone to push you and whom you are answerable to if you procrastinate, and everytime you felt hopeless, they would crack some really bad jokes, which after a point of time removed your fear. Having friends whom you can prepare with and people who have your back is really important during placements, because placements are hectic and chaotic things. People get placed and you don‚Äôt even know, there is constant fear and uncertainty about your future until you get placed and some support would be helpful during this time.[Thank you Navya for listening to my countless rants and stupid breakdowns]",
      "After the placements came the real tough time, that was the time when I was had lots of free time and very less academic load. Being placed, even academic pressure had vanished. I started going down a dark path and met the department counsellor. That was when I was again presented with hope and learnt again that life goes on and I need to move on. I met lots of new people, made new friends, got out of my comfort zone, and tried to attend all campus events. That was when I really changed. Meeting new people gives you a whole different perspective on life.",
      "The final three months on campus were a whirlwind of unforgettable moments. From bookdates with Navya and the electrifying atmosphere of Antaragni and Techkriti to canceled trips and profound discussions, every memory created during this time holds a special place in my heart.¬†From aimlessly wandering at 12 on delhi roads to spending a night on Ganga Ghat just vibing to old songs with friends, from waking up at 2 in the noon to sleeping at 6 in the morning, from hating hostel food to cooking food in rooms, from group studies to room parties. Lots of memories were made.¬†Hall 1 became our favorite hangout spot, where afternoons were spent playing carroms and evenings were filled with badminton games and Uno nights. And let‚Äôs not forget the irresistible biryani at Hall 1‚Äôs mess‚Äîtruly the best on campus. The friendships I formed, the lessons I learned, and the memories I made shaped my final semester into a remarkable chapter of my college life.",
      "There are all kinds of people on campus, take your time and choose your tribe that matches your vibe.",
      "College molded me into a better person, teaching me to judge less, be more compassionate and embrace the beauty of taking things slow.",
      "I realized that everything happens for a reason and the only thing within my control is my actions. Regrets are a part of life, but second chances await those who are patient and willing to take them. Although I am still a confused soul with unanswered questions, I have found a supportive tribe, holding onto the memories that remind me of my capabilities and lessons learnt.",

      "",
      "The mere thought of penning an article that signifies the culmination of my journey at IIT K troubles me deeply. After all, a life within the hallowed halls of IIT had been a cherished dream of mine for years. And truth be told, when I emerged from the exam hall on that fateful day, May 27th, 2019, I had little reason to believe that I was going to secure admission into IIT. Perhaps I underestimated my own abilities, or perhaps I was hesitant to let excitement consume me entirely. Nevertheless, I was content with the results. It was probably the sole instance in the past four years where I felt no regrets.",
      "The first glimpse of the campus came to me when we were required to report for document verification at the nearest IIT. The sheer magnificence of the surroundings left me awestruck, and at that moment, I made the impulsive decision to freeze the choice allotted to me(there were, of course, other factors at play¬† üôÇ ). Little did I know that this decision would set in motion a series of regrets. Like many‚Äîperhaps all‚Äîothers, I had absolutely no clue about my true ‚Äúinterests‚Äù at that time. The only ammunition I possessed to make a decision was the previous year‚Äôs cut-offs. Consequently, I found myself enrolled as a ‚Äú‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•Ä‚Äù student.",
      "No sooner had I stepped foot into the first TA101 lab, a sinking feeling washed over me, and I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if I had made one of the gravest decisions of my life. Admittedly, engineering drawing alone did not encapsulate the essence of mechanical engineering, but that initial lab experience provided me with a glimpse of what lay ahead in the coming years. Remember, it was a time when we remained blissfully unaware of the horrors that awaited us during the internship season (IYKYK). And then there was the (un)prestigious option of branch change. This campus, in all its glory, held everything I had envisioned in the college of my dreams. It offered a myriad of opportunities to nurture my passion for debating and participating in plays. There was an amazing sports infrastructure, and then there were organizations boasting about granting us the chance to delve into lofty concepts like machine learning (at least, that‚Äôs how it seemed at the time). And yet I knew deep down that branch change was my only way out, so I willingly trapped myself in a relentless cycle of studying. The burning desire to liberate myself from the clutches of my JEE preparation days was eclipsed by the greed for a supposedly ‚Äúbetter‚Äù branch.",
      "It didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize that I was no longer in the comfort of my familiar local coaching center or school. The memories of those MTH101 lectures still send shivers down my spine, as I felt utterly lost and clueless. Never before had I experienced such a sense of helplessness. This feeling seemed to permeate through almost every other course as well. It began to dawn on me that perhaps I didn‚Äôt belong here. There were those individuals (aren‚Äôt there always?) who effortlessly managed everything, while I found myself trapped in a seemingly endless ‚Äúvicious cycle,‚Äù unable to excel in any one thing, which only fueled my regrets further. Nevertheless, giving up was never in my nature.",
      "Eventually, I did manage to secure a branch change after two grueling semesters. But at what cost? It was a proud moment, indeed! The intriguing part, though, was that even after the change, I still wasn‚Äôt entirely satisfied because I had missed out on CSE by the narrowest of margins. It‚Äôs amusing to reflect on this now‚Äîthe insatiable greed that can consume us as humans.",
      "By now, you may have gathered that my first year at the campus didn‚Äôt quite align with the celebrated experiences of the campus community. No ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äù, no ‚Äúinferno‚Äù (although I did participate in ‚ÄúTakneek‚Äù, so please spare me the ‚Äúmaggu‚Äù label for that one !), and certainly no late-night ‚Äúbullas‚Äù with friends. I made a resolution to compensate for those missed opportunities in my second year, fully embracing the chance to enjoy without the looming pressure of grades. But as fate would have it, life had a different plan in store, and that plan was called COVID.",
      "The period of COVID will forever remain my biggest source of regret. Initially, I must confess, the onset of the pandemic brought a faint smile to my face. Who wouldn‚Äôt appreciate a respite from the relentless hustle and bustle under the scorching afternoon sun‚Äîrushing from classes to labs to the hostel to CC, and everything in between? However, within just a week, the harsh reality sank in, and I realized that something terribly wrong had occurred. Those two years that followed were nothing short of frustrating, to say the least. There were moments when I felt on the verge of tears. I tried my hand at various non-academic pursuits (remember my resolution?), but the online mode of everything offered little solace. I‚Äôd rather not delve into further detail about that period, as it continues to pain me.",
      "A wave of sheer joy engulfed me when the news finally arrived that we were granted permission to return to campus. It was a moment to mend the weakened bonds and forge new ones. Having learned from the past, I was determined not to repeat the same mistakes. We had a whole year ahead of us, and we were determined to make the most of it. From the ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù Hall 1 weekends to spontaneous short trips. From the vibrant festivities of ‚ÄúAntaragni‚Äù to tranquil late-night strolls across the campus. And there were experiences I can‚Äôt mention here. It‚Äôs hard to believe, that I found myself studying for my courses just one night before the exams in the last semester (which is typically the norm!). I want to give a special shoutout to my C2 mates, who made this past year some of the most unforgettable moments of my life. The placement season revealed that we had become more than friends‚Äîwe had become a family, celebrating each other‚Äôs successes as our own and enduring every rejection as our collective burden.¬† It‚Äôs essential to acknowledge the unwavering support these incredible individuals provided me through the ups and downs of this journey.",
      "As I reflect upon the past four years, do I still harbor regrets over the decisions and outcomes I encountered along the way? The truth is, I don‚Äôt. It is what it is, and there were factors beyond my control at play. Of course, I do feel a tinge of sadness about not holding a flashy Gymkhana PoR or not getting the opportunity to participate in Inter-IIT or missing out on my department farewell (that‚Äôs a story for another day), and so on. However, I don‚Äôt dwell in regret. From my perspective, there‚Äôs a very fine line between feeling sad and feeling regretful. In the words of Mark Manson (if you haven‚Äôt read ‚Äúthat‚Äù masterpiece yet, pause here and read it first !), it‚Äôs quite futile to ‚Äúfeel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you are feeling. Welcome to the Feedback Loop from Hell.‚Äù¬† What truly matters is following the process honestly irrespective of results (‚Äúwhistle‚Äù if you got that ref. !!!), and I believe I have achieved the closure I desired.",
      "Now, as I prepare to bid farewell to this illustrious institution that has shaped me in countless ways, I stand here with a heart brimming with gratitude and memories. I may not have had the conventional IIT experience (or maybe I did ? You decide!), but what I gained far outweighs what I missed. I found resilience and perseverance within myself. I forged bonds that will last a lifetime. I discovered that regrets are part of the journey, but they need not define it.As I leaveIIT K, I carry with me a sense of accomplishment, a newfound understanding of myself, and the lessons that will guide me in the years to come. There‚Äôs nothing more to add.",
      "If, by any chance, you have made it this far, I sincerely thank you for enduring my ramblings. I would like to conclude with a few lines from my Class X books, by Shivmangal Singh ‚ÄòSuman‚Äô, which continue to inspire me to this day:",

However, I didn‚Äôt realize I had started taking my quizzes for granted, and soon everything piled up.

The worst part was leaving the Nukkad Natak just two days before the performance (yeah, I still feel bad about it, and Mukulesh would still make fun, lol).

That ongoing, nagging voice in my head kept reminding me repeatedly that I was a failure, and it was starting to get to me. I didn‚Äôt know when my urge to do everything turned into a FOMO. I constantly felt that I would miss out on all the fun if I didn‚Äôt participate. I participated in E-Summit, made calls to a long list of unknown people, and dedicated my days to the summit. I even managed to secure an internship in my first year, which was also ongoing. Antaragni, the cultural festival, took place that semester, and witnessing the pronites for the first time was a fantastic experience. I became a Junior Exec in both Antaragni and Udghosh. Overall, I devoted my time to various activities except academics. I heard seniors saying, ‚ÄúStudy overnight before the exam, and everything will be fine.‚Äù",
      "",
      "As expected, my performance was abysmal. It was just before the end-semester exams, and I had yet to learn about half of the course the day before the exam. I remember calculating the marks I needed to pass MTH101A and PHY101. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate or know how to study or what to study. I was overwhelmed by the thought, ‚ÄúI wish I could just pass these two courses.‚Äù It was tough for me to accept being in such a position where passing became my main goal. It was the complete opposite of where I had started ‚Äì aiming to do well, achieve a good CPI, and change my branch.",
      "",
      "I ended up with a 6.6 CPI that semester and didn‚Äôt like seeing myself as a 6-pointer. The self-doubt and frustration set in again, repeating the cycle of being unable to study because I wanted to enjoy and participate in various activities and not having enough time to study. After seeing my results, I sat down to reflect on my mistakes. I wasn‚Äôt ready to give up on having fun, but I realized I had been procrastinating the whole time.",

      "During this period, I connected with Kshitiz Rajoria from the Y16 batch. He happened to be from the same hometown as me. He shared inspiring stories of his friends who faced similar challenges and how they overcame them. I gathered my strength, pulled myself together, and fought back. I devised a plan to break tasks into smaller parts and allocate my time accordingly. If I wanted to enjoy the fun features of the day, I had to complete these smaller tasks first. The second semester began, and I stuck to my plan for the first month. Completing these tasks gave me a sense of satisfaction, and I regained my confidence that I could catch up. Everything was going well, except for PHY103, taught by Professor Harbola, and my struggle to keep up with ESC101. The midsems came around, and I performed decently in my other courses.",

We learned a new word- ‚ÄúLOCKDOWN.‚Äù While everything around was kinda depressing, our Endsems got canceled. A few days later, I received a mail from Prof. Harbola- ‚Äú You are being deregistered from the course.‚Äù I, along with some 150 others, had received the identical mail. It felt like ‚Äì I FAILED a course! I got a 7 pointer that semester. I knew I was getting better, but I needed to push a lot more to get to something. I was unaware of what I could improve. It seemed that despite all my efforts, I felt like a failure. I realized that if we are doing academically well, everything seems perfect, and we enjoy it. But most of the time, we don‚Äôt know how to improve and what to improve.",

      "However, finding friends with similar motivation and a willingness to support and assist can truly turn things around. This was when the trio was formed ‚Äì Nishant, Parth, and I became good friends. Our initial connection may have been for the wrong reasons (ah, cheating), but eventually, we started putting in genuine efforts. These friends wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to scold me if I slacked off. Having friends who keep you on track and hold you accountable is truly a blessing. The three of us achieved an SPI of 9+ that semester. Needless to say, I was overjoyed and even shed a few tears.",

      "One fine day, amidst the lockdown, I received an email about the Startup Internship Program by ECell. I heard about it from the seniors, but it required submitting a resume. I managed to create one after multiple iterations. Eventually, I enrolled in the SIP program. However, as expected, most companies were primarily interested in candidates from circuital branches. The few companies open to BSBE students were primarily offering business management roles. Until the last few companies, ‚Äò Touch‚Äô with a 70kpm stipend came. I had almost lost hope by then.",

That‚Äôs how my second-year summers were spent. I received a pre-internship offer from Touch, which led me to decline to participate in the SPO internship season. I worked at Touch for 1.25 years, and it turned out to be an incredible learning experience under the guidance of Vineet and the team. The highlight was the third-year summers when we went to Pune.

It was an exciting feeling to hold the keys to the club. However, that excitement faded when I opened the club and realized I had to clean it. A few days later, we celebrated Diwali pooja in the club. We then started working on a line follower robot for Techfest, and we successfully submitted our project.

Personally, I found it mentally exhausting to tackle multiple instances in a single day. When I think back to my seventh semester, all I can remember is solving cases, taking long walks with Adit doing rr, and Saranya being there to motivate me whenever I felt lost.

      "Divyanshu Gangwar is a graduating Y19 from the Department of Electrical Engineering. From the initial bewilderment to finding a closely knit family, Divyanshu‚Äôs four-year journey at IITK has been a roller-coaster ride. From reflecting upon the struggles of being a college student at IIT, to being an Associate Head at the Academics and Career Council, join him as he talks not only about the good parts of college life, but also about the darkness that often engulfs us as we try to navigate the 4 years of college.",
      "As I finally sit down to pen down this piece with earphones plugged in on Abhijeet Bhattacharya‚Äôs ‚ÄúLamha Lamha‚Äù after my Vox POC expected this weeks ago :P, a stream of flashbacks are overpowering me. Oh IITK, what a journey this has been. A batch whose most precious time of sophomore year was eaten up by Covid, being part of a department infamous for being exhausting and a time when market is uncertain, a lot has been ascended in these four years. It feels as though only a psychedelic trip can actually pour out the real emotions into words. Anyways, from here on, I will delve into two facets: my journey and my message to IITK readers. To a specific niche audience that I wish to address particularly, watch out for the ‚ÄúStruggle, BTs and Life‚Äù section.",
      "I really wondered how on earth some students knew almost everything they needed to know before entering this place. They already came here reading a tonne of Quora articles and YT videos and there I was clueless. I had lived my entire life in UP and yet, entering IITK gate felt like a different world altogether(in fact it is). Although I had come to campus much before JOSAA counseling, I don‚Äôt remember the exact date. So eventually, it was 20th July 2019, when I entered campus on day 1 of the CS orientation. It‚Äôs amazing how a bunch of random people came together to make such a closely-knit family. There indeed have been disagreements among us but what are friends who don‚Äôt abuse you day in and day out. Allow me a moment to digress and call out those fake people who have a habit of highlighting the best moments alone. I have read a whole lot of AWLs, ‚ÄúRISE with the Seniors‚Äù blogs, etc and I used to wonder if all of what some of them are saying is really that much happening or is it just embellishment. If you also feel the same, you are not alone. Nevertheless, back to the topic in hand.",
      "I remember my SG saying that ‚ÄúIss week ko jitna enjoy krna hai kr lo, fir nhi ayega ye time‚Äù. At that time, fatigue from the day‚Äôs relentless juggle would engulf us, rendering these words insignificant. Now I look back to realize how carefree that time was. Mannequin Challenge and Harlem Shake were really the times when all of us became immensely close. We pulled off a great Mannequin performance (at least what we thought :D) to win a Frisbee jiska aaj tk pta nhi kha hai vo. Months passed by as we started bonding in overnight ‚Äúbullas‚Äù.",
      "Months passed by as a bunch of strangers started forging unforgettable memories together within the walls of our wing. Sleepless Tuesday nights with mine and wing-bhais‚Äô TA sheets spread over the table, drafter thrown aside, and us drawing freehand straight lines, Wednesday‚Äôs early morning PE, followed by a 3-hour exhausting TA lab and three lectures in the evening, all feel like a recent memory and I wonder how my lazy ass pulled this off.",
      "IITK‚Äôs parent-hall culture is one of the best things that I feel integrates this place. As ‚ÄúTakneek‚Äù and ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù came in, our horizon of ‚ÄúWing‚Äù expanded to the ‚ÄúHall‚Äù. I met some superb seniors and batchmates who were relentless in their goal and had a sense of commitment. This was a peak time when many of us dedicated wholeheartedly to the hall (not me honestly!). I can‚Äôt forget the relentless nights of wandering and questing during SnT code, only to miss results by a couple of hours. During Takneek, I became close to many people in my hall and eventually made other friends across departments as our classes went by. Then came Antaragni and honestly, for a fresher, this was something that was so majestic and grand. All of these things now feel pretty normal. Alas! We stop appreciating what we get in abundance. Four days filled with a myriad of adventures with a tint of anxiety for Monday‚Äôs PHY101 lab exam were indelible. Months passed by, Galaxy came in, and the roar of beating hearts could be felt in the air, and the ride from Hall-13 to Hall-5 became a quotidian scene. I represented my hall in Parliamentary Debate (albeit not successful) and forged lifelong experiences that I will never forget. While this was going on, I also tried my hands with the Aerial Robotics team. I laugh at myself now when I look back at my old codes, the level of nooby doubts, and the immense struggles I had to go through to get things done. But I think that‚Äôs part of the process, right? Those uphill struggles eventually taught me a lot of niche things and bettered me in my coding journey at an early stage.",
      "There we were thinking that everything was great, and then came Holi Break and changed our odyssey forever. One and a half years of COVID‚Äôs frustrating confinement was an unwanted reality whose marks are indelible. Our whole Intern season, right from preparation was online, in the confines of our homes and though this had its own advantages, the mood was depressing, even for the most prepared among us. I can‚Äôt imagine the struggle and frustration that my Y18 seniors had to go through in their placement prep, and I wholeheartedly sympathize with them. Overall, COVID took one of the most precious moments of our sophomore year, a time when you develop your personality the most, the time when you forge lifelong connections, try out different activities and collectively cry with friends, and resolve to make up for fucked-up things.",
      "Among all the sections, if there‚Äôs one I truly hope you derive most value from, it is this particular one. Dear readers, life is not as happening as some people portray. IITK has always provided me with more than I could ever ask for: an excellent group of peers, a sufficiently competitive environment to grow and a whole lot of activities to choose from, witness and learn. But in this beautiful voyage, there were numerous storms of disappointments. If you have read the above sections, you have probably inferred how clueless I was in the initial days. And I think it‚Äôs completely ok to not be prepared and to not know anything in advance but what‚Äôs not okay is to be swayed by everything out there, which was exactly what my problem was back then. Like every on-the-top freshie out there, I felt the need to do everything, excel in everything and in the process, didn‚Äôt realize my limitations. This leads to anxiety and peer comparison ‚Äì the most harmful thing while living in a community. You end up feeling that you are not good enough, or/and that your peers are better than you, and you begin to isolate yourself in your room. This leads to a vicious cycle of more anxiety as you feel shy to disclose what your problem is. If you resonate with even a single word written here, I want you to know that you are not alone, and numerous students share this very feeling.",
      "Along this roller-coaster ride, there will be numerous occasions when you feel like nothing is working your way, or that maybe you don‚Äôt belong here, or everything is so fast-paced that you won‚Äôt be able to catch up. This is more of a problem for freshers, but senior batches will also relate to this. Be it trying to get a good CPI in a highly competitive class or trying to fit in a load of programming classes delivered within a span of days, such emotions are inevitable. I am not here to offer you a solution on how to deal with this, because you already know it ‚Äì just be calm and patient with yourself, do what is necessary to move ahead and give up on unnecessary pursuits. I am here to offer solace and make you feel that this phenomenon is not rare.",
      "The Academics and Career Council has been an integral part of my journey here. From Secretary to Manager to Associate Head (Institute Secretary for future batches :p), this has been a long voyage. Initially, like every fresher, I just wanted to enter some place for the sake of a PoR. I ended up in the PSG office, Students‚Äô Senate, CS and AnC. As months went on, AnC appeared more fit to my persona and then there was no looking back. I still remember my four-and-a-half-hour long Round-1 of the Manager Interview and whole sleepless night of AH elections and accompanying controversy with endsems just around the corner. I met so many wonderful people during my time: Sampada, Shloka, Alok, Manit, Deepak, Debaditya and many-many others.",
      "To the future core team of Academics and Career, the command of the whole council is in your hands. Just because the GenSec is an elected representative, it is not his/her/their entire responsibility to manage everyday affairs. The past teams have worked significantly over the years to establish AnC‚Äôs position among the campus community, and now the torch is in your collective hands to build on the legacy. I have immense faith in you that you will look upon yourself as members of a team coming together to achieve a larger goal. All the very best!",
      "To all the people I have met in my incredible journey at IITK, thank you for being there. With some of you, I am sure we will meet again and have cherishing conversations. Ayush, Atharva, Vatsalya, Agrim, Vikas, Prathmesh, Varshith, Harsh, Amrit and others, the wing is incomplete without you all. Let‚Äôs sit together again with a deck of cards and go down the memory lane. Videh, you have been an anchor in this final year. Thanks for being there. You and Prateek, remember that approximately 24 hour long of sleeplessness to finish the DBMS project? Oh! What a jam-packed day. Aditya, Utkarsh, Tarun, Aman, Lochan and Prakhar, you people have been there right since first year. Can‚Äôt imagine how dull lockdown would have been without that ‚Äú7 Gabbbar Sher‚Äù :p.",
      "It‚Äôs now time for me to put down my pen and reflect upon all the beautiful memories of IITK.",

      "On June 22, IIT Kanpur successfully conducted an experiment for cloud seeding. The experiment was a success owing to the valuable contribution of numerous people from IIT Kanpur, including Dr. Manindra Agrawal, Dr Mainak Das, Dr Deepu Philip, and their associates spanning multiple departments with diverse backgrounds. With the approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the objective of the test was to successfully test all the equipment required for cloud seeding during an in-flight environment. To better grasp the intricate machinery behind this project, we spoke to Dr Manindra Agrawal in an exclusive interview.",
      "",
      "Vox: What exactly was the project and the intent of this experiment?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:The project is on the concept of artificial rain by a method called cloud seeding. This experiment was conductedto check if the systems required for cloud seeding operate well and collect the relevant data. An important clarification I would like to provide is that‚ÄòCloud seeding was successfully achieved‚Äô is incorrect. The reason is that the intent was to check the systems and collect data, not to seed the cloud and make it rain. In any case, that day from the night, it was already raining, so there was no way even to find out if we had succeeded, even if we had tried. Some media reports are saying otherwise, but that‚Äôs not correct.",
      "",
      "Vox:How did this project start?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:The concept of cloud seeding was taken up five years ago and has been wholly led and funded by the institute. The Uttar Pradesh government had shown interest earlier, but things slowed down due to covid. It was decided to use IITK‚Äôs ownCessna aircraftfor this purpose, for which collaboration with theUS-based company ‚ÄòCessna‚Äôwas sought to facilitate instrumentation and equipment fitting on the plane. However, the progress was halted for over two and a half years due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "During this time, efforts were focused on obtaining validation from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which recently took place in the last six months. This project isestimated to cost about one crore,which the institute has entirely borne up to this point. The recent flight marked a significant milestone as it was the first time flares were attached and fired to collect data on flight behavior. DGCA members were present to observe and gather relevant information. The data will now undergo analysis, and once the DGCA confirms its accuracy and safety, the aircraft will be flown according to the project‚Äôs requirements. The primary objective of the flight was to assess firing and aircraft dynamics, with a particular emphasis on stability.",
      "",
      "Vox:How is cloud seeding done?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:This technology involves salt (typically AgI). Particles of diameter 1-10 microns are sprayed onto the existing clouds. With the introduction of these microparticles, condensation starts, resulting in the increased weight of these particles and subsequent precipitation. The mixture is released into the clouds with the help of flare attachments. These flares contain a salt mixture and gunpowder. They expand and spray the mixture into the air when fused. An additional advantage of flares is that the airplane can fly below the clouds, whereas the hot air surrounding the particles can rise up to the clouds, resulting in a safer flight. Cloud seeding is a well-established technology in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "Vox:How does this project contribute to cloud seeding technology?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:While cloud seeding is an established technique, IIT Kanpur furthered the research with its unique approach. The institute experimented with various salts, yielding promising results.Considering the potential harm associated with large quantities of silver iodide, the institute explored alternatives in common salt of different granularities. As a result, a mixture with a reduced amount of AgI was successfully produced.Dr Mainak Das and his lab played a pivotal role in achieving these breakthroughs.",
      "",
      "Vox:What is the Environmental Impact of this project?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:Cloud seeding allows for the redistribution of rainfall in a region while the total amount of rain remains relatively constant. However, careful consideration must be given to avoid concentrating all the rainfall in one area at the expense of the others. While the potentially harmful effects of the composition mixture require thorough testing, the high dilution of the salt mixture suggests negligible hazardous impact.",
      "The project is designed to serve two purposes.",
      "First, it can be beneficial in regions experiencing little or no rainfall despite the presence of clouds.",
      "Second, in large cities with high pollution levels during winter, cloud seeding can temporarily alleviate pollution through rainfall.",
      "",
      "Vox: What lies ahead for cloud seeding?",
      "Dr. Manindra Agrawal:Obtaining full approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is considered the first crucial step in the project to ensure a perfect setup. Our team is diligently gathering and providing all the necessary data to satisfy the requirements of the DGCA, aiming to secure their final approval. Meanwhile, we‚Äôll initiate discussions with some government entities. We are not interested in doing this on a commercial basis. Notably, there is already growing interest from various state governments regarding the project. The team anticipates that this approval could be granted within the next month or two if everything progresses as planned. Fortunately, this timeframe aligns well with the upcoming rainy season, making it less critical to perform cloud seeding immediately. Once the approval is obtained, the team intends to conduct further trials to assess the outcomes. The team is optimistic and eager to see the results of these trials.",
      "",
      "So, is climate control within our grasp? Certainly not; we are still far from causing artificial rain, as mentioned by Dr Manindra Agrawal, but to recapitulate the essence of this project, we are definitely looking forward to a bright future ahead of us. This success is yet another example where IIT Kanpur has taken a significant step towards achieving solutions to real-life problems faced by the Indian Subcontinent through dedicated effort and cutting-edge research on a collaborative front. Despite facing many obstacles in the path of this project, IITK has achieved a remarkable feat by managing a project of this magnitude solely on its own. We will eagerly look forward to the successful large-scale deployment of this project soon. Congratulations, and good luck to the team!",

      "Some Advice To Juniors:- (It will be convenient to talk about some serious aspects of college life in a more familiar language :|. )",
      "In my experience, college is a not-so-perfect rollercoaster ride; some days will be blossoming, while some draining. Whatever maybe, your friends will always be there for you and therefore I¬† advise you to choose your friends wisely. Take some time to understand people, because time once invested won‚Äôt return, don‚Äôt spend it on undeserving people.",
      "Whatever you love doing, be it academics, some extracurriculars, other leadership/management stuff, etc., do it religiously without a shadow of a doubt because at the end everything pays off and nothing goes in vain. I, myself, couldn‚Äôt participate much in SnT and Sports, but I advise you to pick one activity from all the three groups; Cult, SnT & Sports as it helps in building an overall personality.",
      "Undoubtedly, placement is the most important and final push of your college life, so play it on your strengths, and go for the profile you would want to work into, not just because of its lucrative packages. Be overactive during those four months and never miss out on tests. Keep a close friends/wing circle for all the discussions. Give equal importance to communication(Preparing intro, explaining projects, HR questions) during the interview. Always remember, there is at least one perfect company among all, waiting for you to bless their workforce :).",
      "Last but not the least, be gentle with people. One hidden aspect of college life that keeps running in the background is our Family. During my time on campus, I had a constant struggle going on because of a family situation that nobody except a few knew about. So always be cheerful and help strangers!",

      "Like a newly planted seed, my AWL unfurls throughout my college experience and witnesses the transformative power of the seeds of change sown in the early days as they gradually germinate and give rise to newfound passions and perspectives.",
      "As I write this AWL, my mind drifts back to the day I arrived at Kanpur Central Railway Station with my parents and sister, lugging numerous suitcases and bags. A profound sadness overwhelmed me as I left my home for the first time.",
      "From the orientation week to the batch video shoot and my wingies telling me, ‚ÄúAWL sirf popular logon ka publish hota hai,‚Äù every moment has been so exceptional and unforgettable, leaving me with countless cherished memories that I think this AWL will fall short if I go to describe all the memories.",
      "I vividly remember my first year at IITK, a tapestry woven with exhilarating experiences and endless opportunities. My SG, Piyush, simplified my journey here, as he used to solve my life problems and guide me so calmly that one can‚Äôt imagine. From attending those ‚Äúsleepy lectures‚Äù to shouting ‚ÄúHall-12 ka tempo high hai‚Äù at 2, and playing COD-PUBG in Aman‚Äôs room when he used to cry ‚Äúmera hi room milta hai kya khelne ko tumsabko‚Äù, I threw myself into college life forging unbreakable bonds with newfound comrades who became my pillars of strength.",
      "I explored a lot in my first year, became a volunteer for both Udghosh and Antaragni, which taught me event management, worked with the best team and under the best seniors of IITK- Humanoid team, participated in galaxy and takneek, as every senior used to say, explore karo, padhai to exams ke ek week pahle krni hoti hai. I remember my room fights with Aryan, ‚ÄúLight off krde bhai, sona hai,‚Äù ‚ÄúNa bhai, aajto night out hai, TA lab hai morning me.‚Äù I remember asking Mantaas what he used to eat to top in exams by studying only one night before.",
      "I met amazing people: Abhinav in TA lab, who had solutions for anything you ask for; Manit, who taught me how to remain chill even after missing the submission deadline; and Lochan in the Humanoid team.",
      "One of the most memorable moments of my first year was discovering the Anime Society at IITK, which helped to extend my dream of working in Japan. While some may perceive these memories as mere footprints in the sand, easily washed away by time, for me, they are the seashells that adorn the shores of my existence, holding within them the echoes of cherished nostalgia and boundless joy.",
      "Could I, just once more, be transported back in time to attend those aerobics CPA classes and relish the serenity of swimming at 5 during PE?",
      "The second year went into COVID times, and the academic load intensified like a blazing inferno. Amid this intense pressure, I found myself completing and asking for assignments from Prateek, Devansh, Parth, and Vinoba, giving online quizzes, and on long calls with Raj explaining each ‚ÄúMech‚Äù lecture meticulously. I felt disheartened that none of mywingmateswere in Mech, except Ankit, who pursued Aero. I realized that pursuing a career in Mech was not for me, so the onlyoptionwas to do coding. I remember how my friends Aman, Mridul, and I regularly gave coding contests, discussing ‚ÄúBhai,aajto-100horhihairating‚Äù when everyone said ‚Äúabhise kyukarrhe‚Äú,which improved my skills. The best part was that my friends supported me in every step, whether in academics or emotionally. One advice I would like to give here is that you should not restrict yourself to your dept only; you can explore any field you want, join clubs, andutilizethe time here forself-discovery.",
      "‚ÄúThe only way to dogreat workis to love what you do‚Äú",
      "It would be wonderful to encapsulate all the skills and experiences I have gained here and pack them in my rugged jeans‚Äô metaphorical pocket as a physical representation of the unforgettable journey I have embarked on. Such a symbol would be a constant reminder of the valuable lessons I have learned, the friends I have made, and the beautiful memories I have cherished.",
      "During the challenging 5th semester, my journey resembled a treacherous mountain climb, fraught with challenges and steep inclines. The pressure to secure an internship was immense, and as a non-circuital student with an average CPI, I felt like the odds were stacked against me. The disappointment of being rejected on the first day of interviews was a bitter pill, and it only got harder from there.",
      "I gave interview after interview, putting in countless hours of preparation and practice, but the results remained the same ‚Äì rejection after rejection. During the struggle to secure an internship, I felt hopeless, trapped in a dark phase without a visible way out. I remember how me and my mech friends used to be sad ki‚ÄúYaar isbaar bhi open nhi hui company, abto pure batti dept ki intern lagne vali, xD.‚Äù",
      "I kept faith that my hard work would eventually pay off. And finally, after what felt like an eternity of waiting, I received an internship offer in October, though it may not have been exactly what I had hoped for. I used to think, ‚ÄúIntern season to gaya, placement me chaapna hai,‚Äù and was determined to secure a good placement offer. Looking back upon that transformative semester, I now grasp the gravity of its teachings‚Äîthe vital significance of resilience.",
      "On the other hand, I feel nostalgic about waking up 24/7 during all the nights of Antaragni, Techkriti, and Udghosh, roaming all day long in the events ground and dancing in the best pronites one could ever ask for.",
      "Oh, how I yearn for those interminable queues outside the auditorium, a testament to our unwavering dedication, even if the coveted entry eluded us. The memories and fights of GPLs, those joyous celebrations of birthdays that resonated with the sweetest melodies, are etched in the recesses of my mind. I miss those library and RM study sessions and those daily knocking at doors by Arpit and Siddhartha,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 7:30, chicken biryani khane mess chalen?‚Äù",
      "The 7th semester was a tough time. It involved rigorous efforts, withAnshumannclarifyingmy cp doubts,Varun clearing my quant doubts,and me giving 3-4 tests daily, and the pressure to get shortlisted was so high that itcan‚Äôtbe described in words. As I had prepared hard and was confident, but simultaneously, the competition was so high my confidence turned into fear day by day as the interviews approached. Nevertheless, my perseverance paid off, and I was placed in 1.2. My dream came true as I would be going to Tokyo. The feeling of euphoria that I felt at that moment is something that I will never forget. The happiness I felt was not just for myself but for my family as well.",
      "Finally, the lastsemwas chill, but doing those MBA case studies with Gaurav was troublesome, and fearing with Jatin how this numerical methods assignment will be done. I still remember going to Panshul‚Äôs room and asking, ‚ÄúEco me pass tokardetehainabhai profs.‚Äù I want those photoshoot sessions with mywingiesand mechbuddiesagain. I also miss engaging in late-night strategy discussions with my bhai Ghulam and pondering over which colour Kurta topurchaseto create the best vibes.",
      "The best thing I had with me at IIT K was the best friend circle. I was fortunate to be surrounded by a great circle of friends, each excelling in their distinct fields of expertise.",
      "With friends by my side, my ordinary moments transformed into cherished memories",
      "I want to say, no matter what efforts you have put in the past or what obstacles you face, you have the potential to achieve your wildest dreams. Achieving our goals may take time and effort, but the journey is worth it. Everyone who reads this will understand how crucial it is to have a strong group of friends who will help in the ups and downs of the journey here at IIT Kanpur.",
      "I will profoundly miss the exhilaration of those midnight badminton and table tennis matches with Ayush and the echoes of laughter in the empty corridors. Those late-night cravings leading us to Kathi Rolls at the OAT and those night outs one night before the exams. And how can I forget those 3 am walks around Mama Mio with my wingies, those 8 am ‚ÄúSardi Bhari Classes‚Äù with profs coming in ‚Äúboxers‚Äù, and me conducting those Academic mentor sessions.",
      "Life here will transform you from an empty canvas to a beautiful painting filled with the colours of memories",
      "IIT Kanpur will always remain etched in my memories as the best chapter of my life filled with invaluable lessons. If you need any help, please feel free to reach out to me on any social media platform. I‚Äôll be more than happy to help you in any way I can. I will end all of this with this famous quote:",

      "Keshav Maheshwari is a graduating Y19 from Civil engineering department. In this piece, he is reflecting on his transformative journey at IITK. The pressure to excel academically and the struggle to stay true to himself had been challenging and have provided some useful advice for juniors.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "TL;DR: Everything that has happened to me during these four years at IIT Kanpur has led me somewhere. It is still to be determined where, but I‚Äôm sure it is beautiful. I took a leap of faith and did something unconventional, which was thrilling and overwhelming at the same time. Some things turned out well, and some unexpected challenges became blessings in disguise. Many times, I questioned myself. This article summarises the journey.",
      "Hey, I‚Äôm Keshav. I‚Äôm a freelance product designer. I design Apps, Websites, etc., mainly for startups. I work on ‚ÄòUpwork‚Äô, which is a platform for freelancers. I have a ‚Äòtop-rated‚Äô badge there. I have been doing this for the last 15 months now.",
      "I didn‚Äôt get a job in the on-campus placement drive (2022-23). I failed a department-compulsory course (CE352A) twice. I‚Äôm not very good at my core branch. (I regret this, I should have studied.)",
      "I have wanted to do a dual degree in ‚ÄòMaster of Design‚Äô since my second year, but due to a backlog, I never got the opportunity to do so. The reason for doing a dual degree was simple; I wanted to stay in IITK for one more year, give freelancing proper time, and nurture my skills. My plan to sit for the placements in 1.5 years shifted to three months. I had to sit for placements because my freelancing business, at that moment, was not enough to sustain. I applied for the fields I never liked. I gave a few interviews, and it turned out to be a terrible experience.",
      "I would never have anticipated the graveness of the situation, but I could never have imagined it would reach such an overwhelming magnitude!",
      "After the first phase of placements, I knew there was little to no chance of getting an on-campus placement. But I was glad I gave it a shot, and the experience was truly special. But for backup, I started exploring alternative options.",
      "After failing a course twice and not getting a job through campus placements, I felt demoralised. However, I decided to explore freelancing as a viable option.",
      "It was January 2023. Almost everyone around me was placed. I was making new plans. Designing was something that I had been doing for the last few years. I had already done a few internships in the vertical but had yet to try freelancing. Hence, I decided to give it a shot.",
      "I revamped my Upwork profile to fit UI/UX Design Gigs. I didn‚Äôt get any offers for days. Thankfully I got a project from LinkedIn. It was easy, and the pay was good. It gave me the boost required. All this hit and trial with the new approach went on till March 2023.",
      "I met Archit (Y17) on March ‚Äò22 through an ex-coordinator of the Design and Animation Club in a random conversation where he mentioned him to me, ‚ÄúThis is my friend, and he does freelancing and stuff.‚Äù",
      "Now, as a rule of thumb, whenever I come to know someone who can guide or help me, I ask for help!",
      "So following the above rule, I asked Archit if he could meet; it was the best decision I took in my college life. He taught me the business aspect of freelancing. I started because of him. I don‚Äôt know what I would be doing otherwise.",
      "Apart from freelancing, he also introduced me to the world of spirituality.",
      "I have been interested in Bhagavad Gita and spirituality since school but never got a chance to practise it or learn about it in depth. Like most of us, I wanted to have a scientific understanding of all this, not a sentimental one, and my parents failed miserably in doing so.",
      "One day I was having a conversation with Archit about what he used to do before he started freelancing; somewhere during the conversation, he told me about Bhaktivedanta Club, House No. 664, where people gather and learn about Bhagavad Gita, and actively apply the valuable lessons in their life. He told me about his experience and how his life changed because of that. I thought about giving it a try.",
      "Visiting this place profoundly impacted me, helping me with my anxiety and providing a sense of certainty amidst a life of uncertainties. I met such lovely and humble people there. Everyone there was always ready to help in challenging situations.",
      "You see, in freelancing and life in general, there is so much uncertainty. You need to have something/someone to count on. And for me, it is Bhagavad Gita. I humbly request to everyone struggling in life to read this book or at least once and go to House No. 664, Lane 36, IIT Kanpur. They have an evening program almost every Saturday. Feel free to ping me in case you have any doubts. I would love to help here.",
      "1.Avoid excessive planning:While having a basic plan is helpful, remember that life is unpredictable, and unexpected events may occur. Embrace the unknown and remain open to new possibilities.",
      "2.Explore your interests:Engage with individuals you admire and pursue activities you‚Äôve always desired to try. Life is a voyage of self-discovery; you never know what might resonate and bring you happiness and fulfilment.",
      "3.Embrace spirituality:Incorporating a spiritual aspect into your life can bestow grace and provide strength during challenging moments. Consider exploring the Bhagavad Gita, a book of wisdom, or attend the Saturday Evening Program at House No. 664.",
      "4.Life isn‚Äôt as daunting as it appears:Remember that life is not as tough as it may seem. Give your best within your capabilities and have faith that things will fall into place.",
      "5.Prioritise experiences over money:Instead of prioritising money, focus on gaining valuable experiences, particularly during this phase of your life. Concentrate on learning and personal growth, and success will naturally follow.",
      "Skills you can work on, even if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do in life:",
      "A significant number of individuals may find themselves unsure of their life‚Äôs purpose, but it is a journey of exploration. When something resonates with you, it‚Äôs crucial to be ready and fully committed to giving it your all. To prepare for such opportunities, you can develop the following skills:",
      "1. Enhance your communication skills:Recognize that two individuals can convey the same message differently, resulting in distinct impacts. Developing practical communication abilities can positively influence your interactions and relationships.",
      "2. Cultivate resilience:Whether experiencing success or facing failure, understand that both are temporary. Embracing resilience enables you to navigate through challenging situations without compromising the essence of your journey.",
      "3. Continual learning:Many individuals tend to halt their personal growth once they achieve a milestone. I strongly advise against this mindset. Commit to never-ending learning, even if it‚Äôs just reading two pages of a book every day. You can start with this thought-provoking book, ‚ÄúMillionaire‚Äôs Fastlane.‚Äù",
      "4. Master efficient management:Cultivating good organisational skills is vital for personal and professional advancement. Observe those individuals who effortlessly handle their responsibilities; their abilities are the result of practice. With time and effort, you, too, can acquire such proficiency.",
      "5. The art of setting realistic goals:Establishing practical and achievable goals swiftly propels us towards our desired outcomes. It fosters motivation, focus, and self-belief. Realistic goals pave the way for life-changing opportunities.",

      "BG 3.19:",
      "There are a total of 700 beautiful verses in Bhagavad Gita. May the verses shared above give you a glimpse into the boundless wellspring of knowledge, like a sparkling treasure awaiting discovery!",
      "My life is full of amazing coincidences, to the point where they no longer feel like mere chance occurrences. It‚Äôs as if someone skillfully wove a captivating story. Despite facing occasional hardships, I firmly believe that brighter and more fulfilling chapters are waiting for me in the future.",

It is an excellent opportunity to learn about business and entrepreneurship. My freelance business is doing well, and I have a decent job offer.

      "Mrunmayee Shiledaris a graduating Y19 student from the Department of Electrical Engineering.In the twenty fifth edition of As We Leave, Mruunmayee leaves us in awe of her resilience as we spectate her 3-set badmintn match with college.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "JEE advanced results were announced, and on the very next day, I knew I was coming to Kanpur. My family has a long line of electrical engineers, so choosing IITK EE was not a tough choice. The only thing I knew about IITK was that the academics here are tough, but it didn‚Äôt bother me that much at that time (bad choice). I have questioned my decision to choose EE many times in the last four years, but now that I am graduating, I can‚Äôt complain anymore. I used to play badminton from a very young age, but due to JEE coaching, I had to discontinue it. I was very excited to start playing again, sothe very first thing I searched for was sporting facilities at IIT Kanpur. I was not satisfied with the information online, so I messaged the then badminton captain to learn about the process of getting selected for the team. The first goal I had set for myself was to get back to badminton and become part of the institute team (a good choice).This AWL is not filled with advice on what to do and what not to do; it‚Äôs just my story, the result of the decisions I took, and the consequences of the situations that came. Now that I am looking back at my time here at IITK, it feels like a 3-set badminton match between me and college. Let‚Äôs start with the first set.",
      "My first semester was like a dream for me. After CPA trials, within a week I was called for daily practice, and I knew I was on the right path. When everyone was exploring new things, I was grinding myself to get back to badminton. I was overjoyed to play badminton after 4 years, but it was not easy. I struggled a lot in the beginning, not just because I was not in the best shape¬† but because after the rigorous practice sessions, there was no energy left for anything else, and I was feeling like I was missing out on stuff. I pushed myself and participated in the sessions of the DnA club, but I couldn‚Äôt continue for a much longer period of time. Soon, when quizzes started and I scored terribly low in MTH101, I understood I had to find a balance between academics and badminton.",
      "Days passed, and it was time for my first Udghosh. I, along with Navya, were in team B. We had no expectations; we were just enjoying the experience. The support we got during tough matches made us so confident that we eventually won gold. At that moment, I knew this was going to be a big part of my college life. After our win at Udghosh, expectations started to grow. In two weeks, there was Spardha at IIT BHU, which clashed with Antaragni. We didn‚Äôt want to miss our first Antaragni, but as tournament experience was crucial, we decided to go. Missing Shanker-Ehsaan-Loy‚Äôs pronite was less painful with the winning trophy in our hands.",
      "After coming back from Varanasi, I was able to manage my time better. The memories of sitting together to complete TA assignments but ending up eating soya katori are still fresh. Endsems were coming, and I knew if I wanted to continue badminton, I needed to maintain a decent CPI. One evening, when I was studying in my room, I received a call from my senior telling me that I would be leading the team at Inter IIT. I was in complete shock (LITERALLY!). The goal was to get into the team, but to become captain was something I had never thought of. The confidence it gave me helped in my endsems as well, and I finished my first semester with a decent CPI. Now that I had become captain, I was feeling the stress but was quite excited for it. At inter-IIT, we took on the challenge one match at a time and managed to reach the finals. The final was a tough match against IIT Madras. I made a few decisions before the match that didn‚Äôt turn out in our favor, and the streak of winning gold medals ended for us. I was very disappointed with myself, but seeing one of my closest friends win the gold medal made me forget about the loss and focus on celebration. I was on cloud nine after this.",
      "Winning three medals in total, including one Inter IIT medal, becoming captain in the first semester, and managing to not screw up my acads in the very beginning was surely a big first set win against college.",
      "When I had such a dream-like first semester, I thought I was going to win this game against college very easily, but I was not prepared for what came next. When I saw my PHY103 midsem sheets, my morale dropped as I had scored zero for the first time.I was so sad but was determined to cover up in the later half of the course and even brought Griffiths with me during the midsem break so that I could start studying, but we soon received the mail from the director about the extension of the break and eventually the mail regarding the ending of the semester. I was worried about my Phy103 score and didn‚Äôt know what the prof would do. The day I received the mail about getting deregistered from the course was one of the saddest days, I had never faced such failure in my life, and my confidence dropped. Everything was so uncertain and sad.",
      "I had planned my college life around badminton and GnS council, but with everything happening online, it wasn‚Äôt possible. I started trying out new stuff, but nothing stuck for a long time. I was worried about how I would survive college.Despite my best efforts at planning, the universe had a way of throwing curveballs my way. It is in these moments that we learn to adapt to different situations. Accepting that things are not going to go as per plan is difficult; moving forward takes time. Figuring things out in uncertain times is not easy; trusting even yourself gets tough, but eventually you do; you just need to keep trying.",
      "At the end of my second year, when everyone started to prepare for internship season, I was living such a mundane life that I decided not to sit for an internship because I knew I wasn‚Äôt ready. Seeing my friends get offers made me happy, but inside I was getting worried about myself. I wasn‚Äôt even sure of the field I wanted to go into, so I tried everything that seemed interesting to me. Seniors were back on campus, and soon we were going to be called, so there was a ray of hope that things would go as they were before. I was happy but worried about my internship; at least I had finalized the field in which I wanted to explore more.",
      "The 22 months that we spent at home were not always cheerful for me. There are lots of phases of this time that I don‚Äôt want to remember. I lost this set against college, but I did learn to survive in hard times. From everything planned to not knowing anything about the future, it was not easy. I somehow managed to learn to swim in the ocean of figuring it out by the end of this time. It‚Äôs acceptable to simply get through difficult times without always doing something extraordinary.",
      "We were back on campus in our 6th semester; classes were happening online only, so there was a lot of time. Even though there was time, I had a lot going on at that time. I was part of the Antaragni team, had to select players for the new badminton team, apply for internships, and, along with these things, focus on my academics because this was the last chance before placements to improve my CPI. One more important thing was to enjoy it with my friends and compensate for the time spent at home.",
      "I, Navya and Animesh were the only ones remaining from the badminton team before COVID. It was very strange to become the only senior members of the team because, before COVID, we were the ones in our first year, so everyone was senior to us. We conducted various trials along with our coach and made a team that we can all call a family.",
      "The first challenge for our new team was Udghosh 21; it was an overwhelming experience for everybody, but me and Navya still managed to add another gold to our bag. It was somewhat of a reassurance to me that things are going well. I had not gotten a chance to attend any fest in my first year, so I was quite excited about attending the pronites. Everything was going smoothly; I got an internship, and thankfully it was a remote one because I wanted to stay on campus as much as I could at that time, plus I had ample time to start preparing for placement season.",
      "I had planned in my first year that I wanted to become part of the GnS council, so I went for the Deputy Contingent Leaders‚Äô position. Being a DCL and part of the GnS council taught me a lot. I have made some strong bonds here. At the right time, you do meet the right people. We did every possible thing in our tenure, but in the end, the result was not in our favor, but it was okay. For the upcoming teams, I will just say that they should learn from the last Inter IIT and work on them.",
      "In the seventh sem along with my responsibilities, I was preparing for placements. Doing cases regularly, reading various books, and giving company tests but not getting shortlisted for an interview was very frustrating. I didn‚Äôt have any shortlists on day 1.1; my anxiety was getting to me as I had very few shortlists. On day 1.2 I gave 5 rounds but at the end of the day when I didn‚Äôt get the offer, I was devastated. My confidence was going down every minute. Day 2.2 was the most hectic, and it was the day that I will never forget. I gave nine interviews back-to-back. I managed to give these many interviews because of my friends; they were with me constantly, running between hall 5 and hall 12, scheduling my interviews, helping me relax and focus in between the interviews, and doing anything that was required at that moment. I felt content at that moment to have such people beside me. At the end of the day, when I finally got the offer, I was so relieved and happy. I had not slept for two straight days, but I was still so happy that night that I couldn‚Äôt sleep.",
      "From the beginning of the last semester, there was only one goal-to enjoy college life to the fullest and not have any regrets at the end. I had to do two batti basket DEs in my last sem but even after that, I managed to do everything, go on a trip, perform in DE, successfully conduct Inferno after so many years, dance my heart out in the fests, go on endless parties, spend nights talking and enjoying with my friends, and many more. I did it all. This was the college life I always dreamed of. The last four months have been crazy, and I will always treasure them.",
      "I have won and lost a lot of matches, but one thing was constant that winning always felt good, but winning against college is different. Winning meant that match was ending, and my time here at IITK was coming to an end. I can say college has given me so many things, but the most important of them all are my friends, who were certainly a family away from home, and the memories with them are so close to my heart that I will never trade that for anything. College was tough for me sometimes, and I wasn‚Äôt a fan of that, but it turns out it was getting me ready for what‚Äôs next. All this time, I thought college was not on my side, but it was always on my side, grinding me to become a better person. College does change a person, from being shy and scared to do anything while entering college to someone who can give a presentation in Audi and give a dance performance in OAT in their final year. I can‚Äôt say I am fully ready for the next phase of life, but I am assured I can survive.",
      "When my friends were leaving campus one by one, I was feeling so sad. Each day without them was difficult, but when the day when I had to leave came, I wasn‚Äôt as sad as I had thought I would be; instead, I was happy. The last four years were the best, and as every journey has an end, this also had to end. Leaving with little to no regrets was the plan, and I did achieve that, so in a way, it was the best ending I could get.",

      "I‚Äôm usually not the one who writes. It was Shikhar who urged me to write this AWL, and I‚Äôm glad he did. God knows I procrastinated a lot while writing this AWL, but one fine day lazily scrolling through reels, I read this:",
      "‚ÄúI think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to‚Äù ‚Äì Irfan Khan (The Lunchbox)",
      "It hit me, what if someday I wake up in my usual corporate life and I don‚Äôt remember all the beautiful experiences I had throughout my college life. This AWL is my attempt at preserving all those memories and people I met along this journey.",
      "My journey at IITK began before I even stepped foot on the campus. I remember how I was calculating my JEE Advanced marks on a group call with Siddharth, Varun and Yash. Just before checking Maths Paper 2, my total was nearly equal to theirs. Sid (he gets a bit dramatic at times) disconnected the call assuming my scores would be much higher. I still laugh at the sheer irony of the moment because when I calculated the marks, I got a -3. After putting in an hour‚Äôs worth of effort, I got a negative score. I chuckle every time now that I remember this episode of my life, but back then, I felt downhearted. After talking to a bunch of IITK seniors, I gambled with my future to join IITK with the BS Chemistry branch in hopes of a branch change. This meant an absolute focus on studies and studies only, for I didn‚Äôt want to jeopardise my career for any of my shenanigans. On the bright side, my entire batch of coaching friends was coming with me to IITK.",
      "The first few days of orientation passed away quickly, and I knew these fun-filled events were short-lived. The fact that my Bapu was the Kholu among Y17s and my ‚ÄúBhais‚Äù were from the ‚Äúgood branches‚Äù put a bit more pressure on my head. I got back to studying as the first quiz of the semester was coming soon. I did my best only to get an abysmal 2/10 score on my PHY102 quiz. This worried me even more as I went through a downward spiral. At this moment Atin (whose brother Jatin was also an IITK grad) told me I was being way too hard on myself and shared some secrets from his bhaiya‚Äôs experiences with IITK courses. It had such a transformative effect on me as I started having a much more balanced and healthier outlook on academics.",
      "I performed much better than my expectations and thought if I kept my performance up like this, branch change into EE wasn‚Äôt a far-fetched dream. And then came the second semester to shatter my hopes. I started taking my academics lightly. For instance, being from an ICSE school, I didn‚Äôt study ESC101 at all. I took up the advanced track, only to realise later that my project was much more than I could handle. I realised my mistake a bit late, and I asked the professor to change my project at the last moment. With only two months to work on, others had four months to do their project. All, apart from Yash, who started working only 2 weeks before the submission. I worked my ass off day and night and had such a USP, that the professor was quite delighted with my work. As a result of putting in lots of effort for the project, my attention was diverted and my MTH102 course sank. I lost the chance to branch change into MTH by 0.01 CGPA. I still wonder how well I would have coped with MTH courses, given my other-worldly mathematics performance in JEE. üòÇ I got my branch changed to CHE, and boy, it was such a blessing in disguise.",
      "Feeling a sense of accomplishment, I ended my first year and left behind the constant worrying and anxious version of myself. Almost everyone in our group changed branches to the ones they desired, and it called for a celebration. That‚Äôs when we had our first BBQ Nation party . Just after the second semester ended, five of us went on a trip to Sikkim. This was my first trip with friends, and it was a memorable one. Whether it is the tower stacked from Dominos cardboard boxes or it is the ghost hunting in the resort backyard, my first trip was a resounding success. (Kudos to trip planners Chauhan and Talib) There, I realised I had a passion for travelling and photography (still got a long way to go). I felt a sense of freedom and adulthood for the first time. We spent most of the summers in the library, RM and the swimming pool (when it was not under construction OFCü•≤) to beat the heat. We joined the IITK Summer of Code that very summer, another exposure to development. And like every group project ever, we had one backend developer (Kudos to Sid), two front-end developers, and two guys who just did a bunch of data entry. Talib made a -3 meme in good sport, and Yash shares it to this day on 10 June every year.",
      "Extended lockdowns meant every aspect of our college lives, including the internship drive, would take a non-conventional turn. However, I took up a Double Major program in CSE, and that allowed me to skip the internship drive. With lots of time on my hand and a major, I was highly interested in, things seemed to be going in the right direction. Four of us even joined a fraud internship, and after doing absolutely nothing for 1.5 months, we realized what a sheer waste of time it was. After realizing what a sheer waste of time it was, I started believing in how borderline criminal unpaid internships are. I didn‚Äôt want to waste my next summer too. So Varun and I decided to go for a foreign research internship, on a whim, with no previous research experience. We were just dabbling through the options only for Varun to secure an internship at TU Munich. It was a wake-up call for me, and I started cold-mailing professors seriously. In no time, I found a professor interested in hosting me at TU Dresden under DAAD Wise. The idea of visiting Europe excited me so much that I planned several backpacking trips (especially the Alps) during our stay in Germany.",
      "Destiny must have been in a playful mood, for the world came down with strict lockdowns during the second wave of the pandemic, leaving me to wonder if it was all just a cosmic coincidence or a clever practical joke. With my europe ambitions crushed, I focussed on the upcoming internship drive preparation while juggling the online research internship. (Ping me for preparation tips XD üòÇ) I remember, during the last few days of practice, I felt that I didn‚Äôt know anything and even if I‚Äôd get an internship at all. Only with the support of ‚Äúthe discord group‚Äù could I fight through all these negative emotions. I saw that a bunch of new companies, Jane Street, Optiver, etc came up. Well, I considered them out of my league and focussed on banking and software firms. To my delight, I got into Google on day zero. Google was probably the best software firm I could get into, so I stopped all my preparation and last week‚Äôs revision for the dreadful Day 1. I sat in several Day 1 interviews (SPO formality) with no care in the world (and no revision). It began with the Goldman coding interview, where I claimed I didn‚Äôt know how to reverse a linked list (the first question one sees on the GFG landing page). In my Tower interview, I was asked two problems straight out of 50CP, and thanks to no revision, I didn‚Äôt remember the detailed solution. These situations were almost comical to me, and I even let out a muffled laugh. The interviewers (IITK alums) realised too that I wasn‚Äôt interested in those firms, and after a hearty conversation about IITK, we parted ways.",
      "I don‚Äôt know what came over me, and I decided to give Optiver an interview in full seriousness. It was probably the inviting nature of their interviewers and the Optiver HR. The results were not announced though, and I didn‚Äôt think I stood a chance. My baapu worked at Quadeye, and he convinced me to give the Quadeye interview in complete seriousness too. At that time, I was oblivious to the significance of this event, but later, this would eventually prove to be a pivotal moment in my life, as my Baapu would return as a guardian angel to help me in my hour of need. I remember convincing and almost fighting the SPO team to change my internship to Quadeye at the last moment, even though it was lower than Google on my priority list. They responded, ‚ÄúAccording to the priority list, you‚Äôre selected for Optiver. Do you wish to change it to Quadeye?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúNo, thank you!‚Äù and hurriedly disconnected the call. After processing it for a while, I realised what it meant. I was awestruck, as if the heavens had gifted me with a blessing beyond my wildest dreams. I was merely a guy from Chemical with an abysmal JEE score. It meant my Europe dreams weren‚Äôt entirely gone. They just upgraded from being German to Dutch aspirations. I realised I could still make it to the Alps with a few minor changes to the original plan.",
      "Fast forward to the final semester of Y18, COVID restrictions were lifted, and we returned to the campus. The environment in Hall-1 was wild. Constant partying, halla and lafde were a daily thing. This one time, we returned from the mess, and Shashwat‚Äôs laptop exploded (no exaggeration, it literally exploded). It was made into a meme on one of Instagram‚Äôs most prominent meme pages. The BYOB hall party on the final day took a wild turn as I saw my batchmates climbing the flagpole and others trying to make them slip by showering them with a garden hose. Some people broke off a giant palm tree leaf and threw it onto the mess gate. The rain party kept getting crazier by the hour, and we realised it might be our last time partying with some of those present. It was there that I bid adieu to many of my friends. This semester was the best one yet, except for a tiny mishap.",
      "My visa for Amsterdam was rejected towards the end of April. Ukrainian migrant inflow into the EU made visa rules stricter, and I, along with 4 other unfortunate friends from IIT Bombay and Madras, fell victim to the situation. The HR at Optiver denied the possibility of an online internship mode. I was devastated when I realised I might be left without any internship, which is worse than doing an unpaid internship. I often thought to myself, perhaps I‚Äôve run out of luck, and this is just fate taking its gift back away. Those were genuinely depressing times, as Visa appointments for Indians had 2-3 months of waiting. I contacted multiple companies and started preparing for interviews, but all in vain. No company offered me an internship as they would begin in a month.¬† It was at this moment my Baapu, Satyam came to my rescue. He talked to the HR at Quadeye and re-instated my earlier offer from the firm. I finally had an internship, and that too a great one; however, I had to give up on my Eurotrip dream.",
      "I had no idea how splendid this internship experience would be, that I wouldn‚Äôt even miss Amsterdam. The internship was to be held in Gurgaon for two months. The interns were accommodated at a hotel on Golf course road, and it was my first time seeing such a futuristic city with glass skyscrapers defining its skyline. I was going to share the room with Lakshay. The work began soon, and the pace picked up. Quadeye didn‚Äôt go light on lunch. Every Friday, they would order 150-200 pizza boxes from Domino‚Äôs, and I would try 5-6 different slices over lunch. The firm treated us to an open bar party at the most exquisite pubs in Gurugram every other week. I remember taking a shot of every drink there was at a party. Indeed the clubs at Kanpur were no match for this. In a span of 2 months, I did almost every activity one could in Delhi-NCR. From go-karting to ice-skating, mystery rooms to museum hunting, you name it all.",
      "I even met Manan, Talib, and others as their jobs began, and I crashed with them for one night. There was always something exciting to do at the weekends. Once, I was going to a barber‚Äôs place and saw some IITB peeps heading to Akshardham. Long story short, I had to explain to a sleepy Lakshay why I was returning at 2 AM from Delhi when I had gone for a 30 min haircut. The next day, I acted on Kalyani‚Äôs advice (my biggest mistake üòÇ) to visit a barber in the suburbs of Gurgaon. After walking for 30 mins through an unpaved road, I reached a pothole as large as a lake. I had to cling to the roadside fence like a spider to a wall to cross that abomination of a pothole, but I finally got to a decent barber.",
      "I saw upwards of 12 movies in theatres during my stay. I even met a few school friends and had unforgettable experiences wandering through Delhi‚Äôs Gardens, cafes and expressways to Ghaziabad. Meeting them was the biggest highlight of my trip. You people are missed. We even pulled a few pranks in the office on Anindya from KGP by changing his nameplate to a somewhat obscene one. Tarun pulled another one by setting Kalyani‚Äôs scary portrait as the screensaver on many desktops (Every desktop had multiple monitors, and Kalyani‚Äôs face popped up on all of them). This internship was a wholesome experience where I met so many peers from Bombay, Delhi, Kharagpur and Guwahati, like Esha, Navneet, Ridayesh, Ritish, and others. Well I wasn‚Äôt offered a PPO at the firm. There were a few reasons behind it, but one of the major ones being ineffective communication with seniors and me who didn‚Äôt give my all in, for I realised, however great this company might be, I wasn‚Äôt truly enjoying the work I was doing there.",
      "I didn‚Äôt know how wrong I would be until I started preparing for placements. Shikhar, Prakhar, Lakshay and I were left to sit in the placement drive while others accepted their PPO. The placement preparation was much more challenging than I would‚Äôve done to fix the bug in my internship project. However, I knew that dwelling in the past would get me nowhere, and I had to focus on my preparation. While residing in Hall 5, I found new friends in Kartavya, Utkarsh, Devendra and Ramveer. I often prepared with Lakshay and Kartavya for coding and quant strategies. Varun and Soham would often assist us when stuck on a complex problem during our preparation. I gave most of the tests along with Kartavya. On one occasion, his laptop burst into flames as he opened the lid. Of course, he couldn‚Äôt give the test for that company, but the incident unlocked a new fear that I didn‚Äôt know existed. Another time, the campus was put on high alert due to a leopard spotting near the Director‚Äôs Bungalow. I jokingly said we‚Äôd be safe if we went in a cab to NCL from Hall-5 (~ 1km). Listening to the ridiculousness of the argument, he challenged Kartavya and me to go to NCL through an Uber, and he‚Äôd be willing to pay for that. And off we went to give Graviton paper exuding elegance (and maybe foolishness). A few moments later, another friend reached the venue on a skateboard to ridicule the stupid idea.",
      "Day 1 was very near, and the uneasiness started creeping in. It is in times of high pressure that you question yourself the most. But when surrounded by a seastorm, you sail right into the waves. The path is always difficult; it‚Äôs meant to be. Had it been easy, everyone would‚Äôve crossed it. All you need is a bit of courage and the right support group, and you‚Äôd be through. I received an offer from a reputable Dutch HFT firm before Day 1, and I was overjoyed. Although my eyes were targeting my first priority company, Glean! The offer in hand helped me calm down and gave me much-needed clarity of thought. At 12 AM, I sat for Glean and gave 3 interviews in succession. The results were to be announced in 15 minutes, and I was extremely nervous. Every second felt like millennia, and I had slightly messed up the last round. Would I be selected or not? I decided I didn‚Äôt want to live in constant discomfort, so I headed for the Graviton interview. Just before entering the gate, Varun called me and said I had received an offer. The moment was pure bliss. The hard work of these past few months didn‚Äôt go in vain.",
      "I immediately accepted the offer and pulled off from the placement drive. A friend from coaching days was in the Graviton interview panel, so Varun and I briefly talked with him. He even offered to interview Soham on the spot. It was rather funny as he was ready at the interviewer‚Äôs desk, asking him, ‚ÄúArey aa jao bhai tera bhi interview le lete.‚Äù But Soham kept declining and said, ‚ÄúHumko dena hi nahi, kuchh padha hi nahi hai zamane se.‚Äù I spent the rest of my day helping Shikhar out, and he got an offer from Flipkart by the end of the day. Kartavya had also scored the Graviton quant position. Prakhar, Earth, and Harshit all got placed within a few days. Despite the recession, the placement drive was an astounding success for us. Just after the placements, we vacationed in Vietnam for a week. Talib, Chauhan and others joined us from Korea. This turned out to be the best trip I‚Äôve ever been on. Getting stuffed in the sand, trying crazy food, getting into trouble with a communist policeman, and moped racing on the hilly roads in pitch-black darkness, we collected so many unique experiences.",
      "I knew my time at IITK was limited, so I chose to spend the last semester in peace. To protect my sanity, I took up just ONE course. It‚Äôs the one that has auto-accept on during pre-registration, I‚Äôll leave it to the reader to guess, sorry for being cryptic üôÇ",
      "Turns out that course was the farthest thing from ‚Äòchill‚Äô because my visit to IITB was largely spent in a room trying to figure out an assignment. We missed out on exploring Mumbai with some new friends we met at IITB. Kanodia came to the rescue for the assignment again. Apart from that, my last sem was a relaxed and fun experience. Sure we were chased by ferocious dogs while exploring mango orchards, but it‚Äôs these experiences that you remember ten years down the memory lane. Things like scaling random rooftops, singing my rendition of Kajrare, playing fruit ninja IRL with a sword-sized knife I bought from E-shop, hairstyling Prakhar like Faisal Khan, having a deep conversation with random SIS Guards, tasting Utkarsh‚Äôs expertly mixed cocktails on Kartavya‚Äôs birthday. As I was leaving IITK, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel upset, for I was to leave this place as a student, and who knew when I would relive these moments.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse.‚Äù ‚Äì Irfan Khan (Life of Pi)",
      "This semester, I tried to leave my comfort zone, take up new interests, make new friends, and collect as many experiences as possible at IITK. ‚ÄúPar kitna bhi try karlo, kuchh na kuchh chhut hi jata hai.‚Äù I feel it‚Äôs important to do your best and be content with it. Writing this AWL was an absolute delight, as recollecting every memory would bring a smile to my face, and I‚Äôd have an even greater appreciation for these amazing people I call friends. This was IITK through my lens. Signing off.",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "The four years came to an end, and I could never have imagined that it would reach a climax in such a manner, transforming not only my aspirations and social circle but also reshaping my very identity. What‚Äôs even more interesting is the fact that I never anticipated having to write in English again after my friend had to revise my confession message to my crush due to its nonsensical grammar. Writing this article is really tough because I have to figure out what to include and what to leave out while reflecting on the multitude of experiences that unfolded over these four years. So, just like I always tell my friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like an open book with some closed chapters,‚Äù this article is the same: it‚Äôs an open book with some closed chapters. So let‚Äôs begin‚Ä¶",
      "Growing up in a family where the highest academic achievement was matriculation, the weight of responsibility fell upon me as I embarked on a path to becoming the first engineer in my lineage. Although my parents didn‚Äôt have high expectations, they were happy that I got into a top engineering college in India. They believed in me and thought, ‚ÄúYeh sab sambhal lega ab‚Äù (He will handle everything). College life commenced, and with it came a search for meaning and purpose. The pressure to excel academically was not as prevalent in my case, but I wanted to make a mark on my college journey. During orientation, a question was posed: ‚ÄúWhat do you expect from your college life when you look back after four years?‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what lies ahead, butmujhe bas apni chhaap chhodhni hai(I want to leave a lasting impression).‚Äù So, I started exploring different activities and events on campus. I wholeheartedly participated in various events, but nothing matched my interests. I enjoyed dancing during the fresher‚Äôs night, but some seniors advised me not to join the dance club because it could take up too much time. I followed their advice, but my grades suffered anyway. So yeah despite not going to Dance Club I still didn‚Äôt put effort into studying hence ended up as chhaggi. I realized that Iwould encounter numerous seniors who would generously provide me with a multitude of advice regarding how to navigate college life. Their insights may have proven effective for their own experiences, but it is important for me to carefully consider their perspectives while simultaneously crafting my own path. By attentively listening to everyone‚Äôs input, I can ultimately discern and pursue the approach that aligns best with my individual needs and aspirations.",
      "The second semester started, the seniors started creating hype about Galaxy, and the first-year students of Hall 5 were very enthusiastic about it.I vividly remember hearing a rumor about a Y16 student who had secured a 1.6 crore package, stating that his fondest college memory was dancing in Galaxy during his first year. Inspired by this sentiment, I decided to participate in theGalaxy Dance Competition, which was very challenging. Regular nights out for 20 days was testing my patience, and at many times I wanted to give up dancing, but somehow I managed to survive.Finally, the day of the performance arrived. Dancing on that stage filled me with a sense of achievement and pride.I realized that representing my pool gave me such a good feeling so what will be the level of feeling I will get by representing my Institute? At that moment,I made a firm commitment to continue my journey with the dance club, regardless of the obstacles ahead.",
      "Everything was going well; we won the Galaxy, and I went home in mid-semester recess, and then the Long Night came (yes, I am a GOT Fan XD).The COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing fear and uncertainty.Well, not everything was bad about the pandemic. The institute cancelled the end-semester exams, and that‚Äôs how my first year ended.",
      "During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself grappling with feelings of loneliness and sadness. I became the secretary of the Dance club, but dancing at home wasn‚Äôt easy. Thankfully, my wingies (my wingmates) made the lockdown easier for me. I was lucky to have such great people in my wing. In the first year, our wing D2 had gained a reputation for its remarkable unity, and this spirit prevailed even during COVID-19. To make the most of our situation, we devised various means of entertainment, such as engaging in online gaming sessions of ‚ÄúAmong Us,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmash Karts,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPsych‚Äù (a game we had enjoyed since our first year, often leading to memorable nights out) andDiscord, or Zoom bulla sessions.As an SG, I dedicated a portion of my time to engaging with my bacchas and wing bacchas and organizing bulla and gyan sessions.Additionally, I formed friendships with fellow IITK students from my hometown of Indore, and we would occasionally spend time together.",
      "The fourth semester of my college life proved to be the most challenging, as I was confronted with a personal tragedy that left me emotionally devastated. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well for a long time. Life pushed me into such a situation where I couldn‚Äôt see any way forward. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to handle myself, and I wondered how I would face people. I am immensely grateful to my wingies, who provided support and uplifted my spirits during that time. Their encouragement and assistance guided me through the challenges, and I will forever appreciate their kindness. In April‚Äô21, we went on a trip to Dharamshala and climbed the Triund trek. That trip helped me heal a lot. At the end of the trip, we hoped to meet again after a few months when college reopened. Unfortunately, the second wave of COVID hit India, and we went into lockdown again.",
      "Because of my past experiences, I decided to join the Counselling Service. I applied to become a Core Team Member, even though I didn‚Äôt expect much because the competition was tough. But when the final results came out, I was really happy because I got selected.",
      "As I stepped into my fifth semester, little did I know the incredible journey that awaited me. Before that, I had conducted over 700 interviews for the selection of Student Guides and had spent less time preparing for internships during the summer break. Research wasn‚Äôt an option for me because I needed a job to support my family‚Äôs finances after graduation (a common responsibility for many middle-class students). Despite facing multiple rejections, I eventually landed an SDE Intern position at Razorpay. If you want to hear the full story, feel free to DM me for guidance!",
      "Working in the Counselling Service wasn‚Äôt as easy as I thought. It required a lot of emotional effort, but the results and appreciation were limited. However, the best part was the opportunity to help people on a larger scale. Despite the challenges of working online, we planned and executed various projects that I absolutely loved, like ‚ÄúSafarnama‚Äù ‚Äì a series of interviews with people who shared awe-inspiring experiences, and the ‚ÄúInternship Comic Series,‚Äù which received a lot of praise from our campus community.",
      "In October, the administration called back Resource Constraints students to campus.Alongside them, CTMs were also called to execute the logistics of the stay and rules decided by the admin.Those few months between October and December turned out to be some of the best times I had on campus. With fewer people around, we CTMs formed close bonds and supported each other through our shared challenges.We really used to bond over our traumatic experience XD.Nightouts spent planning registrations and orientations in RM were etched into the fabric of our collective memory. I became so emotionally attached to the Counselling Service that I prioritized its work over my studies. Right in the midst of our end-semester exams, the Y21 batch arrived. However, thanks to our amazing team, we managed to smoothly conduct their registration and online orientation while juggling our academic commitments.Thanks to those galaxy nightouts, I could work day and night and help my teammates conduct the orientation.Our tagline, ‚ÄúSome call it chaos and we call it family,‚Äù set the campus abuzz with a wave of hilarious memes. The freshers showered us with love and appreciation, but deep down, we knew that these connections would evolve as they settled into college life. Nevertheless, those moments remain dear to my heart.",
      "In January ‚Äô22, the entire Y19 and Y20 batch returned to campus, bringing back its vibrant atmosphere. I met someone really special who was there for me during tough times and enjoyed good times with me too. Someone who accepted me with all my flaws and helped me to become a better version of myself.",
      "Despite facing the third wave of the Omicron variant, we had developed strong immune systems and resumed offline events. This marked the beginning of my Dance Club journey once again.Participating in a flashmob became a whirlwind of excitement, especially as I balanced managing the Counselling Service and the dance club simultaneously. The OAT overflowed with resounding cheers and applause as we delivered an unforgettable performance.",
      "Shortly after the flashmob, the Y21s joined us on campus, presenting us with the challenge of organizing a mini offline orientation to revive the orientation culture. However, with multiple campus festivals happening concurrently, finding suitable dates was very hard.Finally, we got a date but, just before the scheduled day, all our bookings were unexpectedly canceled due to a gazetted holiday and the unavailability of workers.So we had two choices, either we could end the tenure now itself and prepare for the end-semesters or we could go and give one last fight to find different venues and re-plan the logistics of orientation. We made the second choice and we literally ran from office to office and buildings to buildings to book venues for conducting events and re-planned and restructured the orientation and finally, we did it.I consider myself lucky to have worked with a team where everyone remained enthusiastic, even as our tenure neared its end.Finally, we did ‚ÄúThe Core Team dance,‚Äùand I delivered a heartfelt signing-off speech. And that‚Äôs how my tenure and the third year ended.",
      "The story of the Core Team tenure sounds like a happy ending, right? Let me tell you other side of the coin.During my tenure, there were incidents that unexpectedly stirred up my past traumas, leaving me emotionally unstable. These inner struggles led to conflicts with some of my teammates, as I was never one to hide my true feelings.I was not two-faced or in better words, you can say, ‚Äúdiplomatic‚Äù person.My heart was deeply invested in the Counselling Service, and parting ways with its work was a tough pill to swallow.I wanted to become the Coordinator to be involved in CS.However, my emotional behavior and tendency to take strong stands led my seniors to doubt my suitability for the position. Although they tried to console me by suggesting I could still contribute unofficially, my aim was never to collect positions for my resume or secure consulting jobs. I simply wanted to make a meaningful impact on the institute and bring my CS initiatives to life.I wanted to make the first-year Raghib proud.",
      "Following my seniors‚Äô advice, I got involved as they had suggested. Yet, it didn‚Äôt feel quite the same. Others held more authority, and my suggestions carried little weight. It was then that I realized how challenging it is to contribute without official positions. Nevertheless, I persisted, providing input and contributing to the Counselling Service as much as possible.The worst part was when my own friends started using me as a bad example of a core team membercausing me to question myself. Struggling with so many self-doubts, I decided to move on from the Counselling Service(Just like moving from an ex-girlfriend lol).Since I had already accepted a Pre-placement Offer, my motivation to leave my room was nonexistent. However, I did find solace in a fantastic group of juniors, and we enjoyed hanging out together occasionally.",
      "During the placement season, the job market was tough due to the recession. I considered myself lucky to have accepted the PPO, but my role shifted to pushing resumes and motivating my wingmates. It was a tiring experience, and I empathized with those going through the nerve-wracking process of job hunting. Eventually, my wingmates found placements, and we celebrated with a party in our eighth semester.",
      "Feeling dissatisfied with the way my college life was nearing its conclusion, I found inspiration in the dialogue from the movie ‚ÄúTamasha‚Äù: ‚ÄúKya hua? Pasand nahi ayi ending? Toh badal do! Tumhari apni¬† kahani hi toh hai.‚Äù Encouraged by this, I created a bucket list for my final semester.",
      "After an exhilarating trip to Goa, where we narrowly escaped sinking when the banana boat unexpectedly threw us into the sea, I returned to campus for Inter-IIT Dance Competition practice‚Äîan item on my bucket list. The extreme winter weather in Kanpur had its toll, leaving our entire dance team sick and relying on paracetamols and cough syrups to survive. The train journey in a sleeper coach to Madras worsened our condition. Despite the adversity, we performed admirably and secured second runner-up in the street battle and group dance categories. Other IITs held our Dance Club in high regard, a testament to the legacy left behind by our senior members.",
      "I also participated in the street battle of Antaragni, completing another item on my bucket list, but it was our juniors who made us proud by winning the Jitterbug for the first time in history. We were overwhelmed with joy, and tears of pride flowed freely. Next on my bucket list was guiding my Hall 5 juniors to victory, securing the coveted Galaxy and GC titles for our Hall. It felt like a gift from our juniors to us, the enthusiastic Y19s of Hall 5, sowe can proudly say ‚ÄúJab tak campus me rahe, na Takneek haari, na Galaxy haari aur na hi GC.‚Äù The final event I participated in on campus was the Dance Extravaganza ‚Äô23, where I danced alongside my wingmates (a cherished item on my bucket list) and the COps of CS. On that unforgettable night, our dance club juniors surprised us, the Y19s, with mementos that read, ‚ÄúA token of appreciation for his immense contribution to the club.‚Äù Emotion welled up within me as I read those words.I am forever grateful to the Dance Club for helping me regain my confidence. It became more than just a club‚Äîit became a family where I truly belonged. As we Y19s of the club clicked photos that night, locking eyes with one another, a silent understanding passed between us: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over.‚Äù And just like that, my college life came to an end.",
      "Over the course of four years, this campus has showered me with love, just as I have cherished it wholeheartedly. I have experienced the pain of losing precious individuals while being blessed with the presence of incredible souls. Experienced the self-doubt of being the side character of my own story (trust me it‚Äôs a very bad feeling) but also got the confidence to face any obstacle that is coming in my life. There were moments of immaturity in decision-making, yet there were also instances where I displayed remarkable maturity when navigating through emotional cases on campus. Reflecting back, I may not be certain if my first-year self would be proud, but I take immense pride in the journey I traversed, the hurdles I overcame, and the person I have become.",
      "The purpose behind writing this article is to provide valuable insights for my juniors, with the aim of imparting meaningful lessons from my personal journey. It is crucial for them to engage in activities and clubs that bring them genuine joy and fulfillment rather than solely focusing on the perceived value it adds to their resumes. Developing diplomacy skills and emotional control is essential in today‚Äôs world, and while it is important to learn these skills, it is equally important not to be diplomatic with close friends, as it may ruin your relationships. Lastly,¬† The concept of holding positions within student organizations was originally designed to enable students to contribute and represent the student community in various capacities before the administration rather than solely aiming to secure jobs in consulting firms. Countless seniors have made significant contributions without holding formal positions, prioritizing what is right for the campus above seeking recognition through position ratification. If your only motivation is to enhance your resume, you might end up doing the bare minimum for ratification. That is one of the reasons I feel why the administration is overpowering students on campus. Hence, instead of asking seniors which position of responsibility would make their resumes stronger and help them land consulting jobs, juniors should inquire about the roles that align with their strengths and where they can contribute most meaningfully.",

      "Mohammad Abdullah Ansari, a Y17 BS Economic Science student. Through his farewell letter to the IITK junta, Mohammad tells the story of almost being terminated to becoming one of the most iconic faces in the college community,¬† the admin of IITK meme cell.",
      "His story has a lot to tell, a story that seems out of an epic lore, as it showcases what it‚Äôs like to be at rock-bottom and then to climb to the very top, to become the best version of yourself.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "",
      "Part 1 ‚Äì From Freshers‚Äô Night to Campus Escapades: Embracing the Bakait Life at IIT Kanpur",
      "Hello, I‚Äôm Mohammad Abdullah Ansari. I am a Y17 batch extended degree student. I am the admin of the IIT Meme Cell page and mentor the IITK Meme Hub page. As I reflect on my time here, I can‚Äôt help but smile at the memories and experiences that have shaped me into who I am today. So, grab a cup of chai and settle in as I take you on a journey through my ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù story.",
      "It all started back in July 2017 when I entered the gates of IIT Kanpur, armed with enthusiasm and curiosity. Being a part of Hall 2, fondly known as ‚ÄúThe Bakait Hall,‚Äù I quickly realized I had found my second home. Fate had a hilarious way of playing its cards ‚Äì my Y16 Baapu (senior mentor) turned out to be the same guy I had bumped into on the train to Kanpur! Talk about a small world, or as we Bakaits say, ‚ÄúBakaiti ka chakkar hai, bhai!‚Äù",
      "One of my fondest memories from my first year was Freshers‚Äô night. I found myself at the Fine Arts Club (FAC), and my Dada, who happened to be the coordinator of FAC, whisked me off to Rendezvous, the cultural festival of IIT Delhi. Those three days were a whirlwind of events, from literature competitions to nukkad natak performances that took me to a cultural high. I still remember trying out different local delicacies at Chandni Chowk, like hot parathas and chaat, which added to the excitement of the trip. The three days spent with my fellow FAC members were filled with laughter, conversations, and happy memories as we explored the festival grounds.",
      "But that was just the beginning of my campus escapades. I dove headfirst into the world of clubs and fests, from E-Summit to Antaragni. I even got some ‚Äúgyaan‚Äù from the super cool fourth-years, who were always ready with treats and work to be done xD. My wingmates in Hall 2 quickly became like family to me during my first semester. We bonded over late-night bulla (chit-chat) sessions, celebrating birthdays with treats at the canteen and CCD (Caf√© Coffee Day), and exploring the various fests on campus. These shared experiences created some of my fondest memories at IIT Kanpur.",
      "As my first two semesters flew by, I made friends, had adventures, and learned much about myself. And as Captain Jack Sparrow once said, ‚ÄòLife‚Äôs not meant to be just one thing, my dear. It‚Äôs meant to be a series of peaks and valleys.‚Äô Little did I know that there were coming valleys waiting for me in the subsequent semesters.",
      "Part 2 ‚Äì Finding Creativity in Isolation: My Experience with CMT4F and IIT Meme Cell",
      "After the summer vacation of 2018, after my first year, I arrived in Kanpur with a strong determination to excel academically. However, soon after the start of my third semester, I began to notice something was off. I started experiencing a persistent ringing sound in both of my ears, known as tinnitus. The intensity and pitch of the ringing would fluctuate, seemingly influenced by external factors and time. This condition profoundly affected my daily life, disrupting my concentration and ability to focus on my studies. Despite attending every lecture, I struggled to hear the professors‚Äô words properly. It didn‚Äôt matter where I sat in the lecture hall, I couldn‚Äôt understand their words. Even conversations with my friends sitting beside me in lecture halls became challenging to comprehend. This experience was distressing, and it led me to avoid noisy environments, and I stopped attending lectures. On top of that, I developed Psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. I sought medical help and was informed by a genetic doctor at Regency Hospital that these were genetic diseases stemming from CMT4F. This resulted in symptoms such as difficulty walking, tinnitus, Psoriasis, and problems with coordination and balance.",
      "The third semester was particularly challenging for me, and I received F grades in 5 out of the 6 courses I took, placing me in the Warning category. During the winter vacation, I went home and tried to come to terms with this new reality for my body. When I returned for the fourth semester in 2019, I struggled to attend lectures and understand the professors‚Äô words. Despite my best efforts, I received a couple more F grades, which pushed me into the Academic Probation category. The difficulty conversing with my friends in noisy environments such as the mess, canteen, and lecture halls made me more secluded in my room. However, I found solace in making memes as a way to still have some form of social interaction. It gave me a sense of purpose and fulfillment to create something that could make people laugh or relate to a shared experience. It was also a way to distract myself from my physical symptoms and the stress of my academic performance. Making memes allowed me to focus on something within my control and helped me feel a sense of accomplishment, even when other aspects of my life felt out of my control.",
      "I started sending these memes to the IIT Meme Cell page, and the admin began liking my memes. Eventually, they made me the admin of IIT Meme Cell after they graduated that year in 2019 when we had around 10k followers. Through my work with the Meme Cell, I found a new community of like-minded individuals who appreciated my humor and creativity. It was a refreshing change from the isolation I had been feeling due to my condition. In a way, making memes became a form of therapy for me, allowing me to cope with the challenges of CMT4F in a positive and productive way.",
      "As I look back on my journey with CMT4F and the IIT Meme Cell, I am reminded of a quote from Liverpool Football Club‚Äôs manager, Jurgen Klopp: ‚ÄúYou can only deal with the situation you‚Äôre in, not the situation you wish you were in.‚Äù While I may have initially wished for a different reality, I learned to accept and work with the hand I was dealt. CMT4F presented me with challenges, but it also gave me the opportunity to find a new passion and community through meme-making. Through this experience, I learned that creativity can flourish even in isolation and that there is always something positive to be found in any situation.",
      "Part 3 ‚Äì Rising Above Setbacks: Overcoming Academic Termination at IIT Kanpur",
      "Then came the summer vacation of my second year in 2019. I decided to consult an Ear Doctor back home, who suggested that I get hearing aids, so I went ahead and got them. It made a noticeable difference in my life, and I returned to campus with renewed determination to pass all my courses in my fifth semester. I started studying with friends and engaging more in campus life, but unfortunately, a couple of weeks later, my hearing aids developed a fault, and I had to send them for repair. The repair work took two whole months, and during that time, I ended up missing classes and spending more time on the IIT Meme Cell page, posting memes to pass the time. As a result, I ended up failing two courses, and my CPI dropped to 2.9. When I received the email that I had been academically terminated from IIT Kanpur, it was a hard pill to swallow. I couldn‚Äôt believe that my academic journey at such a prestigious institution had come to a halt. I felt disappointed in myself for not meeting the institution‚Äôs academic standards, and I was anxious about how this setback would impact my future opportunities and plans.",
      "During that tough time, Bharat from the Counseling Service reached out to me and encouraged me to appeal against my Academic Termination. He urged me to describe the health issues I had been facing that had affected my academic performance. I mustered up the courage to write about my struggles and how I was actively thinking of ways to address my academic situation, seeking support from others, and developing a plan to move forward. Thankfully, my appeal was successful, and I was reinstated into the Institute.",
      "Returning for my sixth semester in 2020, I knew it was a do-or-die situation for me. I was determined to sort out my academics and get back on track. I attended classes diligently, made new friends in the courses I was taking, and fortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was able to secure S grades in some courses and pass others. But it was hard to accept that I was catching up on backlog courses while my peers were moving ahead with their lives, passing courses, getting good internships, and planning for placements. It was a challenging time, but I remained focused and determined to succeed because that‚Äôs what truly mattered to me.",
      "As I look back on my journey through Academic Termination and rising above setbacks, I am reminded of a quote from the 3 Idiots movie: ‚ÄúLife is a race. If you don‚Äôt run fast, you will be like a broken anda (egg).‚Äù Many times your college life may seem like a race, but it‚Äôs important to remember that everyone has their own pace and timeline. It‚Äôs okay to stumble and fall sometimes as long as we pick ourselves up and keep moving forward.",
      "Part4- A Hobbit-Sized Journey: Finding Unexpected Opportunities During the Pandemic (and a Love for ‚ÄòThe Lord of the Rings‚Äô)",
      "But hey, every cloud has a silver lining, right? COVID-19 turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me. With everything moving online, I no longer had to deal with my walking and hearing problems on campus. I could easily text my friends and chat online without any noise disruptions. Lectures were on Zoom or Google Meet, so I could finally hear every word my professors said without any distractions. It was like unlocking a power-up in a video game!",
      "And do you know what helped me through this difficult time? ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù movie series. It became my new source of motivation to conquer my academic challenges, just as Samwise Gamgee was motivated to save Middle-earth. With renewed enthusiasm, I tackled every lecture and tutorial, and my grades started to improve. Those nightmare F grades from previous semesters began to disappear, replaced by shiny As and Bs. My CPI shot up faster than a Gandalf on a firework rocket, reaching an impressive 5.1 by the end of seven semesters. That‚Äôs right, folks, the pandemic actually helped me get my act together. I felt like I was living in my own personal Shire, free from distractions and able to focus on what really mattered. Sure, I still had a gazillion courses left for graduation while my peers were practically done, but I wasn‚Äôt going to let that get me down. No way!",
      "When I think of the Shire, I‚Äôm reminded of my own Fellowship of the Ring: Shubham as Aragorn (my roommate), Amartya (Y13 Chemical) as Gimli, and Yash (Y13 Economics) as Legolas. They supported, motivated, and helped me manage my academics during the challenging times of the pandemic. Our collaboration even extended to creating memes for the IIT Meme Cell, which became a much-needed source of laughter amidst the difficulties. My circle of friends expanded to include Ajit and Vishvajeet, and together, we were fighting our way through the pandemic. I was also fortunate to have the support of previous admins of the Meme Cell, Sourav (Y14 Aero) and Ishan (Y14 Mech), who had my back through thick and thin.",
      "During the winter break of 2020, I realized that many of my peers were moving into jobs after graduation. So, with the help of my senior contacts in Hall 2, I landed a Business Analyst intern at an IITK startup. However, I soon realized that the internship focused more on marketing, and I desired growth in the software domain like many of my peers. Despite the challenges of managing the internship and academics simultaneously, by the end of my eighth semester, my CPI had risen to 5.5.",
      "But it‚Äôs not just about grades and internships. The pandemic brought some unexpected friendships into my life too. I bonded with Arpit (Y10 CSE), Shashwat (Y14 Mech), and Prajual (Y16 Economics), who became my lifelines for sorting out life‚Äôs puzzles. And let‚Äôs not forget Pranav, my IITK bhai, who shared my pandemic woes and kept me motivated through it all.",
      "As J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings, wrote, ‚ÄúBut in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.‚Äù The pandemic may have thrown us all for a loop, but it also opened doors I never expected. Life truly is an adventure full of unexpected opportunities, and I was ready to keep journeying forward with my hobbit-sized determination and a stash of ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù references up my sleeve.",
      "Part 5 ‚Äì The Road Less Traveled: My Unconventional Path to Landing an Internship",
      "During the summers of my 4th year in 2021, I was all set to embark on the elusive quest for an internship through the Students‚Äô Placement Office (SPO) at IIT Kanpur. But alas, my coding skills were as rusty as the abandoned cycles in the hostel cycle stands! Thankfully, I bumped into Kunj, a Y15 senior, who gave me some golden advice ‚Äì to dive into the world of Analytics with SQL and Excel. So I brushed up my ‚ÄòSELECT‚Äô and ‚ÄòSUM‚Äô skills and dived right in, fueled by the never-ending supply of MT chai and samosas.",
      "By the end of my ninth semester, my CPI had risen to a respectable 6.3! Meanwhile, our beloved IIT Meme Cell was also on fire, hitting a milestone of 50k followers by the end of 2021. Move over, COVID-19, we had our own virus spreading throughout the IIT campuses!",
      "During the winter break of 2021, I went into maggu mode, honing my SQL and Excel skills from online resources and even tackling some ML projects like Credit Card Fraud Detection. Together with my Fellowship Of The Ring, we crafted a masterpiece. Resume shining brighter than the legendary OAT sunsets! Armed with newfound knowledge and killer projects, I was ready to rock the off-campus internship hunt.",
      "Little did I know that the off-campus internship hunt would be as challenging as navigating through the chaos of the infamous mess rush on Special Dinner nights. I went on a spree, sending hundreds of emails to IIT Kanpur alumni, hoping for a positive response. Unfortunately, most of the time, I received no response or polite rejections. However, I refused to give up and expanded my horizons by reaching out to non-IITK alumni on LinkedIn and even joining internship opportunities channels on Telegram. The process was intense, and I felt like a lone warrior fighting a battle, but I was determined to land an internship.",
      "I‚Äôve had my fair share of rough interviews, you know, the kind where you feel like you‚Äôre a first-year student trying to impress the seniors. But, as a Hall 2 Bakait, perseverance runs through my veins. Over 2 months, I sent out over 200 emails, applied to more than 100 internships, and went through interviews with 10 different companies. The process was a roller coaster of emotions, ranging from the excitement of getting interview calls to the disappointment of receiving rejection emails. I must admit that those rejections sometimes made me question my abilities and left me feeling deflated. I poured a lot of time and effort into crafting my applications and perfecting my interview skills, so each rejection stung more than the last. Despite the setbacks, I kept pushing forward and reminded myself of the mantra, ‚ÄúFail Fast, Fail Forward!‚Äù ‚Äì a reminder to embrace failures as opportunities for growth and learning.",
      "Finally, on March 14th, 2022, after countless interviews and sleepless nights, I bagged a Product Analyst intern role at Kraze App! It was a major win, and I was on cloud nine! üéâ The internship turned out to be a blast, and they even extended it to 6 months with a bigger stipend, all thanks to my kickass work! My tenth semester ended on a high note, with my CPI rising to 6.5 and a good internship experience in my hands for the placements season.",
      "As Bilbo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings once said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don‚Äôt keep your feet, there‚Äôs no knowing where you might be swept off to.‚Äù And indeed, my unconventional path to landing an internship was like taking the road less traveled, but it led me to a remarkable destination, filled with valuable experiences and cherished memories.",
      "Part 6 ‚Äì From Placement Tests to Meme Cell Family Meets: My Final Semesters at IIT Kanpur",
      "Can you believe it? I only had a couple more courses left before I could say goodbye to IIT Kanpur! After ten grueling semesters, I was finally nearing the finish line. But before I could take the tempo to the Railway Station for the one last time, I had to face the grand SPO placements season. The time when all our blood, sweat and tears come to a head, and it feels like the JEE preparation days again. The placement season started quickly, and we were required to submit our resumes. I updated my resume with the off-campus intern and some more Machine Learning projects, hoping to catch the eye of some top companies. This time I was sure to only apply for Data and Product roles.",
      "The placement tests started, and boy, was I busy! Between taking tests and juggling academics, I barely had time to catch my breath. I also started preparing for mock interviews through the help of The Product Folks and Doremon Den members. I also had some good friends in Harshal, Bhaumik, and Sagar to help each other. And then, the interview shortlists started rolling in, and I was shortlisted for a couple of companies for Day 1-3. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to get placed on these days, right? But here‚Äôs where things got tricky. Despite my best efforts, my hearing issues and lack of experience in physical interviews held me back on Day 1 and 2. It was frustrating, but I wasn‚Äôt about to give up. On the day I finally got placed, I found myself juggling between two company interviews that went on for more than 4 hours, and I had to sit through 5 interviews in total. It was like giving the JEE Advanced test, lol! But all that hard work paid off, and I managed to secure an offer from one of them. The next day I gave treats to my Company Coordinators at Domino‚Äôs Pizza because it‚Äôs an unwritten rule at IIT Kanpur. And as it turned out, both of them were already following my pages and appreciated the content I was putting out. That‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôve made it big, when everyone recognizes your work: students, Alumni, and Professors alike. So that was the Meme Cell Family Meet #61, and it was a blast. The grades of my eleventh semester also came out, and my CPI rose closer to 7.",
      "After a week of celebrations, I decided to pursue another remote internship because I had just one last course to do in my twelfth semester, so why not make the most of it? I hit up my LinkedIn feed, Slack channels, and Telegram channels and applied to five companies in the first week. And would you believe it? I got a reply from all five of them! They all asked me to complete some SQL and Data Science assignments, so I started working on them according to the ascending order of deadlines. Because you know, as they say, ‚ÄúYou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù.Before I knew it, I had two interviews on December 22nd and was selected for both internships. But here‚Äôs where things got tricky again. I had to choose between two amazing offers, which was like choosing between butter chicken and biryani ‚Äì impossible! But eventually, I went with the Data Analyst intern at topmate.io because I enjoyed working on their assignment more, and they were working on the Creator Economy, which I‚Äôm pretty passionate about since I am also a creator. It was a match made in heaven. All in all, December 2022 turned out to be the best month of my life, and IIT Meme Cell also reached the milestone of 70k followers across all platforms.",
      "During my twelfth semester, I spent my time meeting with my page followers, working on my internship, and trying out all the delicious food in Halls 1, 2, 5, and 7. I also bonded with my current roommate, Pradunma, even though he‚Äôs a Manchester United supporter (ugh). But I have to give credit where it‚Äôs due ‚Äì the guy works hard and is chaapu at quizzing competitions. I also got closer to Abhishek Verma, my page follower, and we used to hang out every weekend, talking about memes and life in general. By the end of April, I was also able to complete a total of 100 Meme Cell Family Meets, which is an unbelievable number. It brings me joy to see that people appreciate my content and want to come and meet me. And you know what‚Äôs even better than being popular on campus? The fact that I was able to use my platform to help people. Whenever someone came to me with a problem or a question, I did my best to listen and offer advice. And I‚Äôm so proud to say that I never did wrong to a single one of my followers. I‚Äôve always tried to be there for them, whether they needed a shoulder to cry on or just someone to laugh with. Thank you for liking my memes, sharing them, and messaging me to show your appreciation. And most of all, thank you for being a part of the Meme Cell family. IIT Meme Cell ka tempo high hai! üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "As I reflect on my journey at IIT Kanpur, I can‚Äôt help but think of Detective Lester Freamon‚Äôs quote from The Wire: ‚ÄúAll the pieces matter.‚Äù Every grueling JEE preparation day, every course at IIT Kanpur, every setback, every success, every semester, every internship, every meme, and every interaction with my followers and friends ‚Äì they all shaped me into the person I am today. And now, as I prepare to leave this place behind, I know I am ready to take on whatever comes next. Thank you, IIT Kanpur, for giving me the opportunity to learn, grow, and make some unforgettable memories. And to all my fellow readers, remember: all the pieces matter. Keep pushing, keep striving, and never give up on your dreams.",

      "What I thought to be a premier educational institution turned out to be something much more valuable than that. A factory of relationships, memories, failures and wins. From being someone who was tremendously low in self-confidence the day I came here, to leaving this beautiful place having found my true self, having understood my core values and what I want to represent in life, IIT Kanpur has really brought me up. I‚Äôve felt the most ‚Äòme‚Äô when I was here than ever before.",
      "Trying to summarize what felt like an entire era into just 1000 words is a very hard task. It doesn‚Äôt even come close to explaining what one goes through and learns by going through all those different moments. Nevertheless, I‚Äôll try to focus on the most important instances/realizations I‚Äôve had these 4 years.",
      "‚ÄúWe do not remember days. We remember moments.‚Äù‚Äì Cesare Pavese",
      "I ended my first year with a CPI < 6. I don‚Äôt think I need to clarify, this is a pretty bad state to be in. You might think I was probably out whiling away time with friends and had zero regards for acads. Truth was, I was trying very hard to grasp whatever was being taught. I‚Äôd pulled all-nighters, referred to textbooks, online guides, YouTube videos, literally anything that would help me understand what was going on just a little bit better. The one important thing I‚Äôd failed to do (and probably the only thing I actually needed to do), was just go ask for help, from either fellow batchmates, or from seniors. This incident hammered in me the basic principle that one must follow at IITK : if you need something, or you‚Äôre confused or stuck, just ask. Do not assume you can do it yourself or fix it yourself (maybe you can, but you WILL end up spending way more time on it), or that someone would come to your rescue (IITK has leopards, but no Spiderman or Batman).",
      "‚ÄúEveryone you will ever meet knows something you don‚Äôt.‚Äù‚Äì Bill Nye",
      "This brings up another important realization I‚Äôve had in my time here : networking is wealth. Make as many friends as possible, talk to as many seniors (and juniors) as possible. There are courses that I‚Äôve successfully passed because there was that one senior who was kind enough to clarify whatever doubts I had. I‚Äôve paid my mess bill on time only because my best friend reminded me to do it every single month. I‚Äôve gotten career guidance from so many alums only because I‚Äôd reached out to them via LinkedIn or spoken to them during fests and other events. So connect and surround yourself with likeminded people, people who inspire you. You never know when someone might be of help.",
      "When COVID struck, and we were all sent back home, amidst all the negativity and drama that went on, the one thing that kept me sane, motivated and strong, was Athletics. I was not a regular athlete during my first year, I had very shitty time management skills and I missed a lot of practice sessions. But my 2 years at home changed that completely. I fell in love with working out, with wanting to be fit. I wanted to be strong not just mentally, but physically. I liked putting myself through the pain of cramps or sprains or heavy workouts ‚Äì it helped me focus better, helped me put myself together.",
      "‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt challenge you, it won‚Äôt change you.‚Äù‚Äì Fred Devito",
      "The environment the team maintained both online and offline, whether on ground during practice or off ground when we were just doing bakchodi, was very healthy, comfortable and was built on motivation, mutual respect, support and love. This greatly helped lift my self-confidence and improved my personality as a whole. So make sure you play a sport, or do any form of physical activity every day. Start small, set doable goals and raise the bar slowly. This helps keep you disciplined, focused and strong. It can even open up a different dimension of you altogether.",
      "At some point in this journey, I realized it‚Äôs more important to go behind experiences rather than materialistic, temporary stuff. These teach you life lessons like no self-help book or motivational podcast can. I‚Äôve had easy, happy moments, as well as insanely tough, mentally difficult moments over here. I‚Äôve found it extremely difficult to even get out of bed on certain days, and I‚Äôve also hiked mountains on some others ‚Äì both days are important. And I would never change anything ever because I wouldn‚Äôt be the person I am today if not for them. Take that trip that you‚Äôve been planning with friends. Get to the MT after a nightout and have some hot chai and pakoras. Roam around Z Square once midsems end because it‚Äôs parampara. Do it all whenever you can because, one day you too will look back on where you started and how far you‚Äôve come, and it feels so much better to have memories than regrets.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the mountains we conquer, but ourselves.‚Äù‚Äì Edmund Hillary",
      "I‚Äôd like to end this (not so boring, IMO) story with probably the most important learning I‚Äôm taking away from my time here. I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôve played it very safe all my life. I‚Äôve been the class topper, teacher‚Äôs pet, the studious girl that goes by rules all the time. I‚Äôve dreamt about having a decent job with a good package that would let me get the house of my dreams and have a secure future. But from the various interactions I‚Äôve had with successful people in my time at college, I realized that playing it safe doesn‚Äôt really take you to greatness. You have to be brave enough to choose the path less taken, to go for the unconventional, to play with uncertainty, to shine out and make a mark. You‚Äôd probably be alone in that journey, but it is still way better than ending up being average I‚Äôd say. So take risks; this age is the best time to do so. You have the mind and energy to help you through that.",
      "To further take this point home, I‚Äôd like to share something I relate to a whole lot as an ambitious individual ‚Äì my favorite bunch of lines from the biography of Steve Jobs (I‚Äôm so in love with this book, I urge everyone to read this at least once):",
      "‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They‚Äôre not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can‚Äôt do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.‚Äù",
      "You have the power to change the world. The question is, are you ready to be a rebel?",
      "P.S. To all the lovely people that have been a part of my wonderful journey at IITK, a big thank you from the bottom of my heart. Good luck with whatever you choose to do in life. IITK ka tempo high hai!",

      "As far as I can remember, when I first came to IITK, nights were peaceful, and days were content, and I was just living my utopia of IIT. (Things Changed!) I had read Five Point Someone, where the Author expresses his IITD story, just after JEE, and my expectations from IITK were somewhat similar. However, things turned out pretty different from the beginning itself.",
      "",
      "I entered IITK in the Civil Department but realised that I really needed to change it, and I found myself in the Mechanical Dept the very next year. (The gradient descent of my life again reached a suboptimal extrema xD).",
      "",
      "The first year was hard for me. I believe that I am someone who takes a lot of time to learn new things, and that‚Äôs why I feel like I learned IITK the hard way. Initially, It was difficult for me to get accustomed to knowing that tutorial classes needed to be separate from lecture classes, one should learn to clear their queries from Piazza itself, and one need not do the complete Griffiths for PHY103.",
      "",
      "Prioritising acads (Grammarly is correcting it to ‚Äúacid‚Äù, lol) is a good thing to do. However, I managed to do it in the wrong way, and I was not doing anything else. Me and Harshit (roomie) used to spend the better part of our day in CC and sort of always leave it at 1:40 am sharp. And raced towards Hall-13 Canteen to compensate and reward ourselves with ice cream, be it summer or the chilling winters of January. While entering the wing, I sort of always imagined what all had happened in my wing (FOMO).",
      "Honestly speaking, I was carrying regrets with me after the first semester. The reality is that even if you want to get a good grade, there is an ample amount of time to do something else here. You just have to make slight adjustments with your timings of sleep, bulla, and acads. And I believe that this is one of the things this institute teaches you really well. In my first year, I got a somewhat good SPI, but I got an even better SPI later on when I studied significantly less and did multiple other things.",
      "",
      "In my second semester, I tried to be more inclusive of events happening around me, but somehow my mean position remained acads. I used to be surrounded by people who didn‚Äôt want to be doing anything else except acads. And my admiration for them inspired me to be like them. I think this is the beauty of being immature; you first assimilate from the people around you and then keep the best of their qualities. Everybody I met here taught me something, and I am a composition of all those things.",
      "A peculiar thing happened to me when I woke up very late one Saturday and found out that I have crossed the threshold of classes required to fail NCC. I started believing in god with much greater enthusiasm when I got to know that somebody had mistakenly marked my attendance. If I would have failed it, I had to deal with the most fearful things about IITK ‚Äì Doing PE again with freshers and throwing the idea of BC into the bin.",
      "",
      "Still, after all this, I miss those days (every Y19 does). The first year is when you set the trajectory of your life at IITK. It‚Äôs that point where you are framing and contrasting your version of how IITK should be for you and what IITK has to offer to you. It‚Äôs special because you are still naive.",
      "",
      "When prompted, ‚ÄúWhat would you have done differently?‚Äù a simple no can‚Äôt be an answer to it. Everybody has some regrets and a different way of re-living the good old days. I probably would have filled nominations for senator elections or something like that if I knew how many cascading effects it could have later on.",
      "",
      "The first year was tough but vivid at the same time. I felt like IITK‚Äôs culture was trying to embrace me with open hands, but I was the one who didn‚Äôt push through. I am looking up photos from my phone to write this AWL and feeling emotional at the same time.",
      "I went home for mid-sem break for a full grandeur of 20 months. Initially, everyone was trying to maintain contact with Wingies and friends, but then things faded. Personally, I would say that this break served me well, at least for the first 6 months. This forced solitude sort of healed the mental bruises I had gotten during the first year. However, I don‚Äôt know if it will work for any of you.",
      "",
      "Like every other second year with good internet, I also started bulking up courses on Coursera about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Super Deep Learning (JK) etc. I felt like I was in an imaginary race about who could do the maximum number of courses among my peers. The good thing about that time was that nobody knew when the college would call us back, and I think that‚Äôs why people kept going on.",
      "",
      "Whatsapp Groups, Discord Servers, Zoom Calls, and unstable internet are a risky combination to have. I used to be very tensed about the deadlines of exams on Mookit and the penalty of late submission, but a piece of advice from one of my prof really changed my perspective, and I quote:",

      "‚ÄúTry to overcome your nervousness. If you get nervous about something as insignificant as a quiz, what will you do if, ten years later you are the person in charge of the next mission to Mars? Think about it, and prepare yourself that way.‚Äù",
      "",
      "There was a time when I accepted thatI was not returning to the campus soonand I needed to build upon myself with whatever I had. Finally, a good thing happened to me: I was accepted under GSoC at the end of my 2nd year. Obviously, I worked hard to get it, but this is a story about the deeper implied meanings of my journey at IITK, so I am skipping all the nitty-gritty.",
      "The third year started with the internship season, which also took place in the online mode.I was rewarded appropriately for my procrastination of not doing CP in the summers by merely getting shortlisted. I covered courses of TBBT, Suits, Silicon Valley, etc, in the summers but left DSA for later. Somehow I slogged through the time and prepared DSA and got one internship in September from SPO, but it was a hell of a tough time. Youmight have realised by nowthat most of my learning was due diligence of deadlines. And I think this is probably true for most of my friends. You don‚Äôt revise first and then apply for a job; you apply for jobs first and then start revising.",

      "We returned to IITK at the beginning of the 6th semester, and I got welcomed with COVID for the first time. After a sweet 15 days on campus, I left for home, afraid for my immunity and came back after midsems. Mech template is so flexible that I needed to drop one of my DC (ME354)¬† for the last sem to do courses like ESO207 and MTH535 first. I didn‚Äôt know at that time that I would have to do this DC later on under one of the most infamous profs of Mech Dept. But somehow, delaying doing this DC was intertwined with one of the most beautiful experiences for me at IITK (heartbreak).",

      "Our wing C6 became the epicentre of completing assignments and quizzes among the Mech Dept. There used to be a room filled with 15 people with their Laptops in Hall 13 where everybody used to source code for completing the lab solutions of ME351 like a trading floor.",
      "This is the most interesting and wholesome year in, I think, everyone‚Äôs life. The way you spend your both semesters are in absolute contrast to each other.",
      "",
      "Placements were coming, and like everybody else, I started Leet-coding, resume building, and whatnot. I knew from the beginning that this semester I would be very busy with all sorts of things, so I intentionally picked up more & harder electives so that it became an absolute necessity for me to manage my time properly.

      "",
      "I, being a great procrastinator, was running around the Kanpur Markets for shoes, file folders, a suit, etc., on 30th Nov with my heart racing thinking about everything I had mentioned in my resume and not even looked at for a month. I talked to one of my seniors (Y17), and he strongly advised me to focus more on the HR/Situation based questions. You know, experience is a very beneficial thing to have when you have seen it work wonders. When I entered Hall-12 for my first interview at midnight, I suddenly became so calm and relaxed seeing everybody in suits. I felt like I have finally grown.

      "The happiness you feel for your placement is as momentarily as the above sentence. However, there is an eternal sense of deep content. Maybe that‚Äôs what actual happiness is.",
      "Things became quite interesting the next semester. One thing for which I will always remain grateful for IITK is that most of my courses didn‚Äôt have any attendance criteria. And not going to classes was a constant for me from the beginning. I only used to attend classes for my electives; otherwise, my profs would have honoured me with C‚Äôs and D‚Äôs. I literally had one DE in which only 2 students were writing the end-semester exam, so the prof used to notice the attendance quite well.",

A walk to MT was the first thing I used to do after waking up, obviously for chai. Since I had taken the bare minimum courses to complete my graduation credits, it was important for me to pass all of them. One of my friends and I had ME352 midsem the next day at 8 AM. We soon realised there was a lot to cover, but it can be done in a day. To celebrate this, we started partying at 3 in the afternoon, and the hangover lasted till the night. (Somehow, we did well the next day xD).",
      "Thereis hardly any rooftop in IITK we didn‚Äôt go upon. Spending countless nights partying, dancing, and whatnot, randomly exploring streets of Kanpur, sneaking past SIS guards for L-12 roof (spectacular sunset), riding in campus playing songs on E-rickshaw at full volume, chai at DOAA canteen at 5 am, utilising Insta live archive to save our bulla videos; I am glad to say that we did it all. Thank you, IITK, for this.",

In the eighteenth edition of As We Leave, Nandni reflects on the formative years she spent at IIT K, discussing how the lessons she learned from both her successes and failures served her well moving forward.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "As I sit down to write this, it‚Äôs really difficult to decide where to start and where to finish because I know that no number of words can do justice to what one experiences in these four years at IITK.",
      "It all started with an innocent fresher attending the orientation. Just very soon after attending two days of the orientation, I fell sick and missed the majority of the orientation. My then-seniors told me that I missed the best portion of my stay at IITK (XD). The place seemed very overwhelming to me in the beginning. It really felt initially that achieving something here was only meant for those who were smart and popular. I wish I could tell my younger self at that time how wrong I was!Belonging to a non-circuital branch (Material Science), in spite of having no intention to change my branch, I didn‚Äôt really know what to pursue in the future.",
      "It was initially difficult to adapt to a completely different culture here. I was a very shy person and initially found it challenging to interact with others. However, I had a solid resolution in my mind to make the best of the resources here and bring about a change in myself as much as possible.",
      "I took part in Drameve-1; the practice seemed difficult and exhausting to me at the time, but it was totally worth it. It helped me meet some really nice friends and seniors. The experience really helped me open up to people and improve my time management skills.",
      "Then, as the semester progressed, I tried to be involved in other activities, such as Takneek.Due to my participation in multiple activities, I did not pay proper attention to my academics, which led to unsatisfactory end sems .Then our semester results came out. The spi came as a shock to me, and I made a firm resolution to catch up with the academics in the next semester.",
      "However, the second semester had other plans for me. I took part in the Galaxy Group Dance. That really made me stretch my limits to the fullest. However, winning something for your hall and making your hall proud was something that really made up for the sleepless nights and long hours of practice.I will never forget singing the hall anthem in L-20.",
      "There were many other plans and aspirations to be fulfilled, but then came the ‚Ä¶.",
      "The COVID-19 scenario was really a huge setback for all. Many families suffered losses, and the IITK culture seemed to die down.On a personal level, it was also a very tough time. It seemed difficult to keep up with the online semester‚Äôs academics.",
      "During such tough times, one advises oneself to just take one step at a time. It was really nice to see that, despite these distances, people were there for each other during such a tough time.The extracurriculars seemed to take a huge hit. I got involved in Astro Club, Techkriti, AnC Council, and DebSoc. Conducting activities and having reach in the online mode was indeed challenging; however, with the collective will of all (including the lovely juniors), many fun activities could be conducted successfully.",
      "The second wave of COVID-19 was one of the most devastating things that could happen to our country. My heart still goes out to those who lost their loved ones and bravely steered through it.",
      "As we progressed to the 3rd year, I took up responsibilities as the Manager of Career Development Wing in the AnC council and also as head of administration in IAESTE. These positions really helped me learn a lot about dealing with people. I also took up small internships to gain some experience.",
      "I must admit that I was quite complacent with my preparation before the intern season actually began; however, once the intern season started, dealing with multiple rejections one after the other seemed unbearable. It was really one of the lowest points of my stay here at IITK. As I look back at that time, I realize that those rejections were something I really needed to shape into the person I am today.",
      "I was not really sure about the field in which I wanted to work. I initially wanted to prepare for finance and consulting and pursue an MBA in the future. However, I was not getting internships in those domains. So I started to explore the core field. Initially, I did not have much interest in my branch. However, it took just one course of ‚ÄòBiomaterials‚Äô under Vivek sir to shape up my interests in a completely different direction. I started to take up projects in my core field and started looking for research interns. I started cold-emailing universities for research internships; however, I didn‚Äôt get any positive responses.",
      "The reopening of the campus after such a long time was thrilling yet filled with apprehensions about the future. I finally got to meet my online friends, and everything seemed to change. Except for a few days of the third wave, the 6th semester was one of the best semesters on campus. My friendships also started to change; some of my friends drifted apart, but I also got to meet new people.Clubs started to revive, and the campus started to become jolly once again. We also started to conduct events in hybrid mode. After spending such a long amount of time at home, even attending offline lectures started to look like a good experience. Though most of the MSE courses were covered in the online semesters, it was still great to know about my branchmates in such a short amount of time. I also got to explore lab-related work in my projects, which was really a great learning experience.",
      "As festivals started to be held offline, I took part in the security wing of Techkriti. It was a thrilling experience, even though it came with its fair share of problems because crowd management is really a big challenge. In scenarios where rules need to be followed, sometimes one‚Äôs personal friendships may get strained; however, one must be diligent in their duties.",
      "Along with this, my intern search also continued, and finally, at the end of April, after messaging many people on LinkedIn, I got a referral at KPMG and secured an off-campus internship there. Now, when I look in retrospect, I think that one should keep working diligently towards our goals without taking much BT because working with a calm and clear mind is a much better alternative to being stressed all the time.",
      "My internship experience was quite unique. Since it was an off-campus internship, I didn‚Äôt have anyone from IITK there; however, it was still fun to make new friends there and learn a lot about new things. After understanding the nature of work that a consulting firm entails, I decided to explore new career options for the future.",
      "Since I found the core-related work done during my projects under professors to be very interesting, I decided to pursue higher studies in my core branch. It was not a very easy decision because I saw that many others had started their preparations for grad school appingaround a year ago.People had already given tests such as the GRE and TOEFL, secured their recommendations,and drafted their SOPs. On the other hand, I had made the decision to apply abroad in late June and only had a few months to complete the entire application process. Also, I wasn‚Äôt confident about the strength of my profile in the core domain, so I needed a backup plan. I did not get a PPO from KPMG; hence, I decided to sit for the placements as well.",
      "To say that my seventh semester was loaded would be an understatement. As I was shortlisting universities, drafting SOPs, and running around to secure recommendations, I also had to prepare for the placements, handle the workload of an academically heavy semester,and study for the GRE and TOEFL as well.",
      "At some points, I used to feel like a lone person against the whole world, not knowing if taking too much on my plate would ruin everything. During such times, my family and some seniors became my backbone and gave me the strength to move forward.",
      "As the semester started to end, my applications and placement interviews coincided almost at the same time, and that almost seemed like a breaking point. I could not apply to a lot of companies due to time constraints, and hence only had a few interview shortlists. I just had one interview on Day 1 (which I didn‚Äôt even think I would get into) and targeted the other companies.",
      "Little did I know that my placement BT would end within an hour of the start of placement interviews. The company (Alvarez and Marsel), which seemed out of my league, gave me the job offer after an hour of interviews. Securing a job on Day 1.1 really boosted my confidence and eased my tension about the MS application as well.",
      "As the last semester approached, I faced some personal setbacks, but I also got to meet some of the best people I could ever meet on campus, whose friendships I will really cherish forever.",
      "The final semester was really a blast thanks to these wonderful people. I also got admissions from various universities. It really gave me the satisfaction of ending things well at IITK.",
      "As I wrap up this article, I just want to say that life is too short to involve yourself in drama and negativity. It is never worth it to compare yourself to others; one should focus on their own journey and progress.In this competitive environment, I would advise my juniors to never fear taking risks (although please do pay attention to your academics), try new things, meet new people, and cultivate friendships.It is never too late for anything. IITK has really given us a lot, and we should also try to make our own contribution for its betterment. Apart from developing your personality and skills, one should also try to develop values of compassion, empathy, and betterment for all (be it at IITK or elsewhere).I guess that‚Äôs enough Gyaan for now‚Ä¶ see you next time!!",

      "Orientation",
      "The first chapter is about the incredible orientation, which was literally a living trailer of the journey that we were about to encounter. The whole idea of ‚Äòbapu-bachcha‚Äô and ‚Äòbhai-wingies‚Äô was new and interesting. My bapu, Haren Bhandari, was the first senior I met, and he is still the best. He is the only one who inspired me to become an SG. The seven days of orientation were one of the best parts of the beginning. I still remember some of the slogans that we were made to shout: ‚ÄúBlue film, awww‚Äô, ‚ÄòBaal ho toh kaise ho, Sagnik Dada (my dad, btw) jaise ho‚Äô, ‚Äò ek-do ek-do core team ko fek do‚Äô. As I write this, I feel that all those feelings are running back to me. All the goofed-up story of ‚ÄòHR Kadim‚Äù‚Äîstill, I am unaware of its need in the whole orientation, but it was a topic of intense discussions in the wing at that time. The freshman and DJ nights followed the orientation. I got a sprain in my ankle and was not able to participate in it, but I enjoyed it wildly at the DJ night. I still remember that night just because of the people with whom we danced. Harlem Shake was also a good thing that happened to me; I showcased my directorial skills (my dead dream now) and directed the video.",

      "The first semester started with L20 and full attendance (which is now sounding unreal). Obviously, everyone can relate to the fact that MTH101 was the scariest thing. Not to make this ride any boring with the intricate details of personal struggle in this course and how I finally got an A grade (not flexing, btw), let‚Äôs move on. There were other courses, including TA101 and PHY102, where we had the chance to meet new people. My lab partner, Ambuja Budakoti, was one of the first people from IITK outside my wing with whom I befriended. Doing TA101 assignments might have been a tough task for many, but it was very easy for me since I had been a good artist as a painter and craftsman in my school days.",

      "PE101 cannot be forgotten. It was the worst of all the experiences. Being an owl throughout my life, it was incredibly tough for me to wake up at 5:30 a.m. after sleeping at 3 a.m. On many days, I didn‚Äôt even sleep. After the phase of getting up and entering the ground, out of nowhere, the athlete inside me always became active and encouraged me to join the gym (what unstable thinking!). And sadly, I was also part of NCC; there are no words to explain how painful it was.",

I played badminton for hours, and I still do. I had a dream of playing badminton after clearing JEE, and at least that came true in the best manner. From being a noob to an expert (people say this, not me), my badminton has been great. I pooled money from my wingmates for the rackets for my personal use and forcefully taught them badminton to ‚Äúplay. Badminton, being a recurring topic, will come and go.

The best part was being with the wingies and just viewing the scenes. It was an experience that is not easy to explain in words. Very few people know, but I participated in the Antaragni competitions of the Debating Society IITK. I was with Piyush Agrawal and Diya Singhal. It was a good new experience.",

Being an excessively study-loving person (not a maggu guy; I am intellectual, ha ha), academics were not impossible to push through. Being a batti peep, I also wanted to change my branch, but my dreams were shattered (pun not intended) as I went to study with another wingie, Kush Daga, before the PHY102 exam and landed with a B grade in the course.

I somehow wrote something and submitted the file, which eventually did not get submitted (idiot me). The next round‚Äôs list was not released, but people got the notification for the interview. I didn‚Äôt. I then contacted the ERA head directly, and he (to my horror) evaluated my code live while chatting with me; it was actually an interview in itself. I got selected, and I also got selected in the final round, becoming a permanent team member.

I learned C, C++, Ros, Python, Fusion360, computer vision, image processing, and whatnot. It was the best place to learn and execute. Any praise will be less in exchange for what ERA has provided me with. I did incredible projects (which were essentially real; funny, isn‚Äôt it?) and they are still showcased in my profile. I learned how to communicate and discuss in detail the technicalities of a problem, which will help immensely in the future.",

I eventually got a golden opportunity to work with Professor Subrahmanya Swamy Peruru on the topic of the classification of wireless signals using deep learning techniques. I worked on this problem with a PhD student from the University of Washington, USA. He was in the USA, and we had to manage time constraints. We eventually published the research paper.

There I made new friends, who are now part of my core group. Yashasvii Lohar, Pooja Choudhary, Abhishek Yadav, and Akash Kumar Bhoi These people made my internship time smooth and easy. Then came the Ooty Trip, where I got to know two incredibleIITKpeeps: Abhay Mishra and Inshit Darania. That trip is still the best trip I have ever had. I went to Delhi with Rishi (my other wingie), and then we went to Kutch-Vadodara in December with Sagar Agrawal, Shubh Agrawal, Prateek Jain, and Videh Aggarwal. I went on another trip to Goa with Aakash, Sagar, and Videh. It was an adventurous trip where we lived the Bollywood life of a typical Goa trip and got destroyed by washing away our phones in the sea (bye bye phones). The latest trip I had was with my whole wing to Prayagraj-Varanasi. It was a wholesome trip with full-on emotions and divinity.",

During my stay, we conducted three eight-day UHV workshops.

      "Keerthana M Arun is a graduating Y19 from theDepartment of Physics. In this piece, shetakes us on a transformative journey, filled with resilience, profound friendships, thrilling research pursuits, and the ever-changing landscapes of college life.",
      "When I was filling in the form for As We Leave, they asked me what set me apart and what I could talk about in the minimum number of words that would make sense for at least some people that only I can tell. That got me panicky because I have a pretty regular (ish) life at IITK, nothing chaapu or exciting. But, then, this would be a feeling I am qualified to talk about. Maybe this is what people need to hear ‚Äì being normal(ish) feels great, and my life is definitely not falling apart if I average it over a month‚Äôs time. Also, I feel talking about my entire 4 years of life at college would include a lot of mundane things. So, going to talk about four things I feel is a good start to describe IITK for me, and as always, DM me for more stories if you think I might have any that you are into. So, returning to the four things ‚Äì Research interests, Friends, Intense hall love, and mental breakdowns. I chose them in quasi-chronological order based on phases in my first semester.",
      "So, I chose Physics at IITK because I knew that research(in Biology or Physics) was something I found appealing at that point in time. Physics felt marginally cooler and gave me a scholarship, so I picked that. I did not know what or how I wanted to do and wanted answers from day 1. As you might have guessed, I reached out to second years and to a Prof in How I met my Professor. The first lot told me that research was hard and Physics labs a complete pain. The professor told me to do my courses well and then get back about projects. That was not the answer I wanted, but I tried to do the courses well with questionable success. I took courses in everything I thought I would be interested in from 3rd semester, like Number Theory, Bioinformatics, Information Theory, Data Structures and Algorithms, Feminist Theory, Molecular Biology, and International Diplomacy. Eventually, Bioinformatics, along with Molecular Biology and Information Theory, stuck with me. I also started doing a project from 2nd year summers in Bioinformatics. In my 3rd year summer, I got to work in a lab, and I loved the lab experience. So, by the end of summer, I was sure I wanted to do a Ph.D. in quantitative biology with my feet in both wet lab and computational work. But the issue was, what exactly did I want to do in this vast domain? It took a couple of months to put it down for the applications, some interviews with the programs, and many rejections by March. That was a scary moment that took me back to the first semester when I had a vague idea of what I wanted to do but with no actual leads. However, the difference IITK made was that I knew who to reach out to, gave me the perseverance to send out 100 emails for research assistantship roles, and a support system to catch me when I fell into the depths of aimlessness (more about that later). This part of my story does have a good ending ‚Äì I have a research assistant role for the next two years in a domain I love, and it gives me the time to sketch out the finer details. You might wonder if my interest in biological research waned in between, and you would be right. It did because of some things I tried on campus (like the fem theory course). Still, I knew it was right for me because even after a long day, I was happy to discuss the nitty-gritty details of some topic in semiconductors or throw a night out to work on some code for my project. This was something I was unwilling to do without external motivation for most other things.",
      "The next worry in my head in my first semester was about FRIENDS. I always dreamed of having a large friend group in college, going on trips with them, and being there together forever. So, the first few weeks did not really work out like that. People appeared to find tons of friends, and I was kind of hanging out with some wingies and always on the lookout for ‚Äúthe friend.‚Äù By November, I had two great friends ‚Äì Saumya and Debaditya and was super excited. I think that they were what made my first semester, with academic disappointments and a weird shade of helplessness to make my life better, doable. This continued to the second semester, before and after the pandemic struck. Online, however isolating, was a medium I thrived on socially. Conversations over Facebook posts, many messenger groups spammed at once, and hour-long calls with people I had just met over the next two years helped me reconnect with my acquaintances and reach out to new people, especially seniors. I was a part of the Counselling Service in my second and third years, which required me to push beyond my comfort zone to talk to many random people. This also allowed me to organize the Wabi Sabi contest, wherein my friend group literally converged into a WhatsApp group. And they are the people who make IITK home for me and the ones I waved bye to as I left ‚Äì Meghna, Saumya, Uma, Pradunma, Shashi, and Debaditya. This has led me to realize that while I can actively search for ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù I will meet them when I meet them in places I authentically wish to be ‚Äì scrabble matches, CS core team, wing competitions for Jigyasa.",
      "I am sure hall feeling in IITK has a whole series for itself, but it was slightly different for people at Hall 6. In the first year, Jigyasa was the first time we realized there was a significant difference and how ‚Äúmerit‚Äù is highly dependent on who the person is or what their hall is. We were literally termed ‚Äúthe potential girlfriends for the people from other halls who helped our wing win.‚Äù This continued onto Takneek when we just participated. But as a batch, we broke the expectations from hall 6, and that was the first time I felt that overwhelming feeling of loyalty to a bunch of people I lived with. Then came January, and with it, Galaxy. I still remember the speeches at GBM and the sparse attendance. I wanted to give it my all and signed up for dance. Then came many, many nights of practice and days of PHY103. The seniors seemed to have infinite energy to make us go over each choreography multiple times, which gave us first-years the determination to stick with it no matter what. We were rewarded with the dance cup, and that is one of the proudest moments on campus. I tell every Y22 I meet about it when they ask about my years on campus, and I still feel the warmth of pride on my face as I write about it. The second encounter with this feeling was in my 8th semester, with the restarting of Takneek and Galaxy. I wanted us to be the seniors we could not find in the first year to guide and motivate. I really hoped that things would change, and they both did and did not. As a hall, we did better than ever before, but I am confident we could have done better. This feeling especially hit after the SnT night out when there were literally four of us from the pool in the morning. I am sure as a hall we can do much better and we shall.",
      "And the heaviest topic for the ending ‚Äì dealing with mental breakdowns on campus. The first hit me sometime during my first midsemester exams. The feeling was a mixture of academic disappointment with no good ideas to improve my situation, finding it hard to hang out with people I genuinely wanted to, and being homesick after 3 months on campus. It included a lot of overthinking, keeping it all in my head, and just bursting out in tears routinely. And after a particularly sad bout of crying over a call with mum, we decided that the best idea was to go to the counselors to figure out what was going on and what I could do about it. The first session was cathartic, and I walked out a lighter person ‚Äì literally because a lot of shed tears and mentally because I could finally tell someone about everything in my head. This also helped me categorize my ‚Äúlife problems‚Äù into things I could do something about and those I needed to accept and move on. And somehow, by November, they did with a couple more sessions and a kind of acceptance about academics in my head. My second breakdown occurred in 6th semester though I think it started sometime mid 5th semester. This time academics were going pretty great, and my CPI had recovered well. But I felt like a disappointment to everyone I knew and had lost interest in courses. Back on campus, living in the rooms took its toll, and I lost all my productivity. So, this time it was different because I knew exactly what was wrong, but I still could not fix it. My academics began to tank again, and loneliness began to set in again as I could not share this feeling of dread. Summer came in the middle of this, and I went to Vancouver for my MITACS internship. It was my dream internship and, at the same time, one of the experiences which helped me learn about myself and what I value in life. I was having bouts of productivity interspersed with long gloomy days. The return to campus made me acknowledge the sheer privilege of being surrounded by people I loved, doing the work I was enthusiastic about, and just existing in a familiar place. Perhaps, this feeling was what tipped me over the dreadful times.",
      "I do understand this must have been TMI for most people, but I hope you get the point that when looking back, certain experiences are etched deeper than others. It was a narrative decision (thank you, Suchitra ma‚Äôam, for the course and the many discussions about this) to include these parts of my last four years and exclude so many others because this is perhaps my unique offering, or so I hope. The four years were a long time because IITK runs at 1.5 times compared to the outside. Each day brings humidity, rain, intense sunlight, and chilly winds. These experiences have taught me to weather it all out and even enjoy it. My last message would be that you will encounter many critics among friends, family, and professors, but the harshest one is you. It took me some time to figure that out, and I believed people wanted me to be someone I was not. But looking back, it was my inner critic that wore that disappointed frown. So here is a poem( a villanelle, please look it up) I wrote to put away those feelings.",

      "Success in life really boils down to one metric, who can bounce back the hardest. In his story, Tej Prakash, a Y19 graduate from the Chemical Engineering Department, talks about the ups and downs that he faced in college life. As a part of the Antaragini Core team he provides his perspective on the IITK life and that makes this a very interesting read.",
      "A Journey from 5.9 SPI in the first sem to Pre Placement Offer, graduating with 7.4 CPI.Initially, before coming to college, I had very low expectations in terms of placement, and after the first semester, it further deteriorated after my SPI came out to be so low, as I actively used to participate in various activities such as volunteering in Antaragni, Udghosh, Takneek, etc. However, in the second semester, the depression of the first semester prevailed, and the new policy of grading due to COVID saved my grades‚Ä¶ I won, but at what COST?",
      "We all used to be the toppers of our respective schools and I was no different, but this trauma prevailed and I couldn‚Äôt even focus anymore and it got worse with time, Still I carried on and my spi went like 5.9, 7.1, 6.5(yeah I didn‚Äôt have good connections in online sem), 7.8, 7.5, 7, 8.5, 8.75, So, in the last two offline semesters it was evidently better, as well said:¬† ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt delete our memories, but we can CHOOSE what to remember‚Äù",
      "Talking about the second semester, where we used to stay till 2 a.m. in NCL for simulation projects, that was a really new experience for me, and that momentary but memorable journey from NCL to Hall 13 in the cold nights of January really got on my nerves. Those night canteens were all thrilling after getting out of your home.",
      "",
      "As we had much time in between those decisions for the opening of college after the immediate closing, I had enough time to learn Python, which helped me to secure an internship in CAMPK12 as a coding mentor that paid 38k per month which really boosted my confidence & overcome my inferiority complex as that intern had some other interns too who had already secured PPO from companies like Samsung Korea and many IIT B students. (PS: It‚Äôs not a flex for IITK peeps)",
      "I used to focus on skill learning majorly, and even today, I feel that excelling in some skill, be it developing a website like Amazon, an app like WhatsApp, completing some machine learning project, or being a great video editor, helps us overcome the underlying insecurity of not achieving a high paying job. The third, fourth, and fifth semesters were completely online, so we had nothing much to flex about. However, the only thing I felt was that the lockdown happened at the perfect moment. Had we been in 12th, it would‚Äôve been challenging to deal with JEE getting postponed, and if we were in our final year, it would‚Äôve severely affected our placements. On the brighter side, we easily passed our most rigorous semesters online with the ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù of batchmates, if you know what I mean.There were things that we used to do in online courses like ESO206 & CHE261, where we used to draw diagrams on a paper beforehand and just write the question number while taking the exam, and that actually added weight to the answer even if it was not relevant xD. Also, sharing your screen, live, with desktop audio on Discord with a phone screen in front of you would get you answers during viva. When I was in my 3rd year, I formed a group in HSO201 with seniors, and then I realised that we should never take final-year seniors in project groups (if you haven‚Äôt yet, you‚Äôll realise it soon)‚Ä¶ Also, in my last sem, there was a course, CS771, where the entire sem I did nothing but give some PPTs that I even read just 15 minutes before starting. There was a project in that course where we had to develop a model to translate Hindi sentences from a CSV file to English. If someone can guess what I did? I made a model using CHATGPT! which was as useless as first-year PORs, and since it never worked, I used Google API to convert all the texts and then submitted the assignment, claiming that it was generated using the code written before. There was also a viva for it, so I knew that even if I were going to show them the live model, it would take not less than 3 hours just to do the epochs in training, and then prediction could follow, so you got my point right üôÇ‚Ä¶",
      "I always had this sense of insecurity of lagging behind others that provoked me to fill out every single form sent by student gymkhana for any sort of internship, and during one of my internships, my mentor told me, ‚ÄúHaath pair vo hi marta jise tairna ni ata, tairna sikho‚Äù, so what I realised unknowingly is that I have explored so many fields like I did an unpaid internship as a graphic designer in the first year itself and also one internship as R&D intern in one startup that made me ready not only to swim but even dive in the water. All he meant was that we need to have expertise in at least one field, and being merely good in multiple fields won‚Äôt get us anywhere.",
      "",
      "Head, Design Antaragni Core Team",
      "During Covid times, I participated in a workshop organised by the DnA club, and that‚Äôs where my design journey started. As time progressed, I developed a good portfolio of some designs, and one of my friends, whose first name is the same as mine, referred to me as the ex-head design of Antaragni, and that‚Äôs how I became Head Design that somewhat helped me to secure a good internship in the second-week intern phase as I then had something to cover up for my low CPI, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt change the direction of the wind, but I can ADJUST my sail to always reach my destination‚Äù.¬† However, after coming to campus in the middle of the sixth semester, it became really hectic to balance such a position with academics, and after seeing my seniors who were festival coordinators, I realised their only aim in life is organising Antaragni and nothing else: xD. If you are going to be in any core team, you will feel it.",
      "",
      "Also, I was sober and didn‚Äôt do any sort of ‚Äúnashe‚Äù, and that somewhat weakened my bonding with many who were part of the Antaragni team, and that‚Äôs one reason why I didn‚Äôt continue in the Antaragni in my fourth year as the¬† Festival Coordinator. Every time, I used to hear so much knowledge about different addictions we can have here as well as abroad. I used to judge a lot before coming to IITK, but after coming here, I realised it‚Äôs completely fine, and I might even try it someday.¬† At least people are happy about it, and that‚Äôs what matters. Our end goal is ultimately HAPPINESS, right?¬† As long as it doesn‚Äôt become a HABIT, it‚Äôs completely fine‚Ä¶ Talking about the fest, It is really a privilege to have a metal Id card in your third year while the other third-year students don‚Äôt have that different level of flex. As we all once used to be toppers of our school and then suddenly became average people in our college, that feeling of being different is provoked during those four days of Antaragni with that walkie-talkie, just roaming around the events ground area for no reason with a dead walkie talkie to flex, group photo with Sunidhi Chauhan and Ritviz. However, I realised later that some stalls in the events ground had coupons for the core team, and I lost one day without freebies.",
      "Talking about some series, I would suggest (a few of my favourites):",
      "The 100",
      "Queen‚Äôs Gambit",
      "The Gifted",

I also played the piano and painted (check out my ig handle), and I loved playing table tennis. After coming here, I realised there are different levels of players, and the ones who are very skilled don‚Äôt wanna play with the noobs, and this is something where it feels like you are unwelcome somewhere. Just like in Pubg, where we don‚Äôt entertain noobs in our team as long as that is not a GIRL‚Ä¶",
      "",
      "Last Year",
      "A few of my best friends, including Varun Khatri, Sanket Kale, and Tarun Kanodia, were always with me. I cannot keep a count of so many others. The night-outs during Antaragni were the most memorable moments I would cherish all my life. I used to be with Sanket lately, who helped me with online as well as offline exams & had this whole Maratha gang (that‚Äôs what we called them). I never understood a word, but the bonding was deep with all of them. It was Varun Khatri who actually did my ESO207 assignment, which I could never forget.¬† Also, I would like to mention Ambuja Budakoti, my co-Head Design, who is so enthusiastic to study that she is doing dual in the sustainability dept. I am done with studies now if I ever go for anything like higher studies, it will solely be because of Mazburi and not because of interest‚Ä¶ who agrees?",
      "My only regret in these four years was not having ‚Äúbandi‚Äù in the college itself, and there was no success outside either. That‚Äôs a different story that I never asked anyone on campus lol. Those who are single will totally relate with me here. It sucks seeing couples everywhere, getting 0 hearts at puppy love, and this feeling is escalated during the fests‚Ä¶¬† Whenever I meet someone, even those who were holding the topmost PORs say, ‚ÄúUS BRO US‚Äù‚Ä¶. This is something where I need a junior‚Äôs adviceüôÇ(only experts xD)¬†.",
      "",
      "A major lesson for guys who have been reading till the end is that once I used to think group study was useless, however, I realised in my last year that it‚Äôs not entirely the case, rather studying with your group might push away your distractions for a while. The best tip I wish I had gotten earlier would have been to contact as many seniors as you could and gather as many resources for the courses as there were courses like IME672, CHE362 where previous year questions would be asked, and CHE641, where we‚Äôd have the same repetitive assignments and all your saanp friends would have all the solutions and questions and have an upper hand. Believe me, nearly everyone has previous year‚Äôs question papers, but if you ask them, they might not be revealing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs something GAME CHANGER.",

      "Saksham Gupta is a graduating Y19 ¬†in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In this edition of As We Leave, he recounts his journey through his years at IITK , of finding and understanding his life‚Äôs purpose and quenching his curiosity to do what he wants.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "When¬†I decided to pen my memories of this amazing place, I realized how much I‚Äôve changed in these last 4 years. It would be quite rare if you‚Äôve already met a person who wanted to be a mechanical engineer and build machines but then goes on to research cancer biology? Well, here‚Äôs my story of choosing this unfamiliar path.",
      "It started with my single-minute dance performance at the Freshers‚Äô Night. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined that my introverted and stage-frightened self, who had never performed a dance move publicly, could get on stage in front of a thousand judges and perform confidently after just a 10-day practice. I‚Äôm not so sure about the audience, but I was pretty satisfied with my performance. I stepped on the stage once again for the Galaxy group dance for Hall 2. Though those long and exhaustive night-outs did not pay off and we stood last, yet it was a barrier-breaker for my social awkwardness, and it did wonders in my academic life as well, hehe. If I keep all the fun aside, my SPI for the second semester was the lowest of my academic life. I know a lot of people call me maggu (very rightly so), but this was a setback for me, and I decided to get back to academics and leave my dance craze for later.",
      "Now that I had to pivot back to my studies, my next step was to figure out my academic and career interests. The reason I had opted for mechanical engineering was because, at the time, I was pretty sure that I‚Äôd like to go into mechanical core industries, build machines and bigger stuff. I joined the IITK Motorsports team to get hands-on experience and also worked on a project with Prof. Ishan Sharma, the coolest prof of my department (I guess). But due to COVID-19, my desire to get hands-on experience and my fantasies of building a car and whatnot got washed out.",
      "Slowly but steadily, I started losing interest in most Mechanical courses as they were all theoretical. I also realized that the courses and in general the whole department was not exactly what I had expected, which was partly my own fault too. I wasn‚Äôt so interested in the theoretical aspects of fluids, materials, stress, and solid mechanics, but rather in dynamics, robotics, and building stuff. Whatever the scarce experimental opportunities I could have had vanished due to the pandemic.",
      "All this aimlessness struck me just before our internship season. While everyone was preparing rigorously to secure a plan of action for the following summer, I completely lost sight of my career path. It was probably the worst timing for the confusion that was bubbling in my mind. As a failsafe, I asked myself if I should try for a corporate internship, but neither was I a coding enthusiast nor did I have strong soft skills. Anyway, later on, my interest in the corporate side of the world got weaker and weaker when I saw the struggles my friends had to go through during their internship season.",
      "Around the same time that I started cutting myself off from my own department, I set out to explore the biological sciences. In my first year, LIF101 was one of my most beloved courses ‚Äì Prof. Pradip Sinha introduced us to genetic engineering and its applications, which fascinated me. During the pandemic, I quenched my curiosity by reading beginner-level books and watching videos on YouTube and educational sites such as Khan Academy. Some of my colleagues and seniors also suggested that I change my department to BSBE. I was afraid of taking such a big leap as it was a very unconventional step, and I was also doubtful about losing interest in BSBE in the future. Had I changed my branch, there would have been no coming back, and I could‚Äôve lost all the advantages that mechanical engineering provided during the placement season. Though the chance of me going through placements was bleak, I still wanted to keep that option secure.",
      "To sort everything out and give myself some more time, I planned to register into the BSBE dual degree programme. During my 5th and 6th semesters, I did a lot of coursework in the department, and after a lot of hiccups, I landed a (cool) project in computational biology with Prof. Hamim Zafar in the BSBE department. This project assured me that I could pursue it as my career path.",
      "As I started flourishing, there came some logistical problems. First of all, there were a lot of course-slot clashes between my ME compulsory courses and BSBE courses. Next, the project was entirely computational, but I had always wanted to explore experimental biology, which I couldn‚Äôt do at IITK. Sometime in the midst of my 6th semester, when everyone around me had something planned to do in their summers of third year, I mailed a lot of professors at different places for a research intern, but got rejected from nearly all of them. It was one of the lowest moments in my life ‚Äì I was helpless and sad to have nothing to do in the summer, which further made me under confident and started a vicious circle that was killing my spirits to do anything. Many students had already secured research internships abroad, but I hadn‚Äôt applied to any international internship programmes and didn‚Äôt contact foreign professors as I was not confident as to why someone would provide an internship to a person with nearly zero background in their field.",
      "One March evening, three of my friends, Devansh, Tanisha, and Yash had a long talk with me, and they boosted my confidence to reach out for internships. For the next few days, we sat together and prepared my CV. I had already compiled a list of researchers in my interest domains and set out to cold-mail them. As I was already late to get any LOR from my professors, I didn‚Äôt have a lot of expectations of getting through, but after many rejections, I got a call for an interview at the end of March.",
      "‚ÄúMake good friends. They‚Äôll help you make everything possible.‚Äù",
      "I was extremely nervous as this was my first ever interview, and I was not an eloquent English speaker. My gang helped me prepare my introduction and the generic questions that I might have to answer during the interview. I still remember that night vividly, my interview was scheduled for 4:30 AM, and I had no formals for the same. While Tanisha and I were revisiting my CV and reviewing the minute details one last time before the interview, Devansh & Yash got me a decent formal shirt. Luckily, I got an on-spot internship offer, and I can still feel the moment when I came outside to tell them the result, and we all hugged.",
      "Though I had gotten the offer, it was just a crack on the surface. In the next 45 days, I had to get the US visa, find accommodations in Seattle ‚Äì an unknown city, 10,000 kms away- and keep an eye on my academics as the end-sems were approaching. Many-a-times, I got so frustrated and wanted to give up, but now that I held such a valuable opportunity in my hand, I couldn‚Äôt have let it go. I used to start my day by visiting various IITK offices to get documents, then attending the lectures and preparing for exams, and finally replying to all my US emails, sending the required documents for the visa, and arranging accommodation. All the while, my gang and Mohit provided whatever support I needed.",
      "After numerous sleep-deprived days, I was able to arrange the visa and the accommodations, and on the side, I also got my best SPI till date. I finally went to Seattle for 2 months, working in the Berger lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre, pursuing my interest in experimental and computational biology, specifically cancer genomics. My PI Alice, my mentor Phoebe and many other people in and out of the lab taught me a lot about experimental biology and about different cultures and making my time in Seattle unforgettable. It was an experience that can‚Äôt be expressed in words but can only be pictured!",
      "In 2 months, I‚Äôll be joining as a Research Assistant in the same lab to gain further experience. I would finally get a break from the continuous and never-ending coursework that I have been doing throughout my life. I didn‚Äôt apply for a PhD this year by choice, and I‚Äôm certain that I‚Äôll be better prepared and refreshed after having worked full-time in a research lab.",
      "There‚Äôs still stuff that is left unexplored by me at IITK (and most of you would feel the same way when you graduate), but whatever I put my hand on, I never got out without giving enough effort. I kept on trying even when my interest waned, and left only when I had no choice but to move forward to some other thing. The institute gives you a huge amount of freedom (which is sometimes unsettling) to make your own path. In my case, in just two months, my life changed drastically. I was extremely anxious on 20th March 2022, which quickly turned to satisfaction and excitement by 20th May while I was on my flight to Seattle.",
      "In the end, I believe that perseverance and good company can make everything possible. The 4 months during which I arranged the internship, then the accommodations and flights, and finally staying in Seattle all of this gave me enough self-confidence that I feel I can tackle any challenge now. The group of friends I got here always backed me up and helped me through any hurdles I faced. As the cherry on top, my 8th semester was also extremely enjoyable because of all of my friends whom I‚Äôll cherish forever.",

I think this is why these opportunities are abundant.",

      "When you enter here, you are given this free pass to go do whatever you like with no prereq, except very importantly, ‚Äúthe enthu‚Äù. In this exploration stage, some people get lucky, some stay confused, and some just go down the same conventional path, which is delaying the decision to find what one likes. You‚Äôll find a lot of people who seem too sorted and a lot who seem ‚Äòtoo chill‚Äô about life. I was far from chill, and the thought that this might be the only place where I am allowed to try out and, more importantly, reject things without having any consequences, used to haunt me continuously. I felt as if I was running out of time. Like others, I was worried about finding my passion at 20, thought of placements as if it was the job I‚Äôd do all my life, and treated life decisions as if they were utterly irreversible. Having no clear idea of what I wanted from these years or what I wanted to do after college, I could say that I had no ‚Äúnorth star‚Äù to guide me. The independence that I got allowed me to choose what to do, and knowing the level of impact that these decisions might have on my life was very overwhelming. But I think what made the entire journey worthwhile was that I never stopped going out and exploring, something I would advise everybody to do. It was while going through this process, where I tried things out, introspected and retrospected on them that I realised what IITK actually helps you with, and it‚Äôs more than just acting as a means to find your passion.",

      "IITK is quite a close-knit community, it is an ecosystem in itself. And I loved it the way it was. But it‚Äôs a different picture outside and within the campus, both literally and figuratively. You get more exposure here than when you were in school, but it is still not how it is in reality. You go out for internships and exchanges, but that‚Äôs also for a short time. You know that you will come back to these comfortable surroundings eventually. ¬†Even though it doesn‚Äôt really expose you to the real world, it does wonders to prepare you for it. It instils in you the courage to back yourself and take risks. Pushing you through rigorous coursework time and again trains you to work hard.

And when I think about the way it does this, a picture comes to mind, which is of a parent sitting at the table with his child, tutoring him and saying, ‚ÄúHey kid, so now I am going to give you this situation and let us see how you react to it and handle it. Don‚Äôt worry, if you keep trying honestly, you‚Äôll not fail. It may seem fruitless but believe me, you‚Äôll realise its importance later.‚Äù",

      "IITK makes you comfortable to change, both within and around you. That being said, IITK definitely changes you. I was a people-pleaser. I highly valued what people thought of me as a person. Most of my satisfaction came from the respect people gave me through my achievements rather than the achievements themselves. Think of the guy who loved to be the monitor and would complain about even the silliest things to the teacher. I was very similar to that guy, and naturally, I had the same attitude coming in. Had it not been for the post-Covid semester I had here, I think I would have stayed the same. Living in a town where I had no school friends and online meetings being the only way to communicate, I was pumped up to be back in college and wanted to meet a whole bunch of people. I wanted to be more social. I knew this was a change in my attitude, and was okay with it. But it wasn‚Äôt taken positively by many people, including some of my friends. For them, it was seeing a different Lakshay after 1.5 years than who they had said goodbye to. At this time, I felt very confused. When I felt happy with how I was behaving and functioning, I could not see why there were people thinking that I had changed. Some even made comments that I was acting fake. I was constantly in a state of self-questioning, in fact,¬† I remember crying out in front of a friend about this. I also thought about returning to who I was so that other people like me and keep their feelings the same towards me. The influence that this time has had on me as a person was life-changing. It taught me the importance of letting go, expressing my emotions and making myself my number one priority. It also taught me how sometimes good communication and empathy solves the problem. But most importantly, I realised that either you choose who you want to be or the world will do it for you.",

Every activity you become a part of, whether it be academic, sports, or maybe one that relates to a very distinct passion that you foster, comes attached to other people with the same interest as yours. I found my closest friends through some of the activities I was engaged in. A lot of this was because I was willing to venture out and take part in things. If I had chosen to stay within my comfort zone, things would have been much different, and I don‚Äôt think I would have had the friendships I have now.",
      "IITK also makes you realise how effortful it is to maintain relationships, whether work or non-work. It‚Äôs different from school. School gives you a routine that makes you meet your friends every day. But in college you actually realise the efforts it takes to maintain friendships, especially when you have a good lot of friends. You go through a lot of ups and downs. I remember¬† I had almost called it quits with a friend and told him, ‚ÄúMaybe we are just not cut out to be friends‚Äù, and now still have him as one of the best people in my life, and somebody I can really count on. I see a lot of people facing similar problems, and I feel an absurd feeling of satisfaction whenever I see them.

You realise how normal it is to reach out for help and what it means to be there for someone in a time of need. I have cried, ranted, laughed, and shared a lot of emotions with my friends, all of whom I love dearly and would not exchange for anybody. I remember just before the Y18s were going to graduate, my wing and I were sitting, and somebody randomly put a guy on the spot to talk about the experience of this last semester. He started with how much fun it was, how everybody stayed together and shared so many memories, and I don‚Äôt know when tears started falling down my eyes, and then in some time, all of us were doing a group hug and crying like babies.",

While I don‚Äôt necessarily think that hurling abuses through creative slogans to people of other halls or forcing people to participate in inter-hall events by dragging them against their wishes is a part of this culture, I understand the logic behind it. It easily relates to every way that IITK helps you grow. The ‚Äúhall feeling‚Äù, a part of this infamous culture, is instilled as a means to encourage participation and, more importantly, as a means for students to come out of their shells and make connections. Forcing people to take up something in inter-hall events forces them to explore something that interests them. The countless nights that go into preparation, the problems students have with time management, and the results that they get, whether positive or negative, in my opinion, help them grow in some way or the other.",

The culture of an institute is something that you, as a student of that institute, feel proud to be a part of and propagate. A culture of participation in sports, a culture in research, a culture of promoting inclusivity, a culture of collaboration, a culture that celebrates arts and technology ‚Äì a culture that makes you a better version of yourself.

Looking back now, I don‚Äôt recall if it was my desire to explore everything or my fear of missing out on anything that made me come up with it.

      "After procrastinating for the n-th time, I finally sat down to write this article. It‚Äôs still hard to believe that the four-year journey is coming to an end. From giving the first ever online JEE to spending 2 years of college online to facing placements alongside impending recession, our batch has seen it all.",
      "The above quote is a derivative of Jim‚Äôs quote from The Office, and I think it aptly captures my journey. What I have with me now is much more than I could ask for, and I owe it all to this institute. As I was reading some past AWLs, I realized that most of them had a constant theme where the writer seemed to have a lot of positive experiences, and the negative ones taught them a valuable lesson. However in my case, for a significant portion of my college life, I was stressed. This could partly be due to the online nature, and partly due to the fact that most of the time we kept chasing a ‚Äòhigh‚Äô that lasted ‚Äòlow‚Äô. Now as I write this article, I realise that when we see our college life through ‚ÄòGraduation Goggles‚Äô (HIMYM fans, wya), our brain tends to make us forget all the bad experiences, and we only remember the good ones. This article will be a summary of my journey, for my batchmates to reminisce and juniors to learn (if there are any lessons to be taken :p).",
      "I still remember the day I first stepped in Hall-13, as if it was just yesterday. I hadn‚Äôt lived in a hostel before, as my hometown is Kanpur too. So the initial days here were quite a challenge for me. As if living on the topmost floor in a triple sharing room in the scorching heat of July wasn‚Äôt enough, even the fan in our room did not work properly! Thanks to my roomies (Amartya S. Das and Arya Bhatta), who made this transition a bit easier. As time passed, my wingies began to interact well with each other, and I am grateful that our wing still holds a special bond to this very day.",
      "The first semester began, and just like everyone else, I too was bowled over by academics. I was quite intimidated by seeing people asking doubts in MTH101 tutorial sessions, while I failed to even comprehend what was being taught. Seeing other people participating in various clubs, events did give me a big FOMO, as I was focusing only on academics initially. Looking back at it, I realise it was mostly due to the competitiveness that JEE preparation had instilled in me. In hindsight all that overthinking seems silly, because now I can look at the bigger picture. Whatever I did/didn‚Äôt do in the first year doesn‚Äôt really affect where I am now. So if you are a first year reading this, my advice would be to choose a particular activity that you genuinely like, and get involved in it. Even if you don‚Äôt (due to some reason), do not stress over it, you‚Äôll end up just fine :). There‚Äôs one philosophy that I learnt in my first year and found particularly useful for rest of my stay at IITK:When you‚Äôre going through hell, just keep going.This is applicable to almost any bad situation that you might find yourself stuck in. Also, having friends going through the same shit as you helps you get it done, compared to when you‚Äôre stuck alone. Whenever you find yourself worrying too much about something, just go out of your room and sit with your friends, soon you‚Äôll forget the most pressing of your troubles (for the time being at least). After midsems, I became a volunteer in Antaragni Security Team along with my ‚Äúbhais‚Äù, just because my ‚Äúdada‚Äù was the security officer at that time. Our SG (Soham Ghosal) had told us that it wouldn‚Äôt be as fun as we were making it out to be, and we did find that out soon enough XD. The first semester flew by quite fast.",
      "As we all know, in the second semester we were struck by COVID-19. The ‚Äúone-week‚Äù mid sem break was extended indefinitely. To be honest, I don‚Äôt recall much of the online part of college life because it felt like we were stuck in an endless cycle of sleeping and watching lectures. Multiple assignments, continuous evaluation and high averages became a constant in everyone‚Äôs life.¬† During the summer break, I hadn‚Äôt done anything productive either, and most of the time was spent chatting, calling, or playing ‚ÄúAmong Us‚Äù with friends. When I found out that our wing SGs got internship offers, I realised that I too would have to participate in the internship season at the end of my second year. Following Soham‚Äôs advice, I started practising coding. The third semester introduced us to some CSE courses, including ESO207, which has been a part of my academic journey since then :p. I have taken this course in the third semester, helped my friends get an A ( ‡§ú‡§ø‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•á ‡§® ‚Ä¶ ‡§µ‡§π ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•á ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à¬† üòõ) in this course in the fifth semester, and even became a tutor of this course in the seventh semester (more on that later).",
      "Then came the summers, where some of my friends did an SIP internship. I realized I did not have much to write on my resume then (first year ‚ÄúPOR‚Äùs are not really PORs), so instead of trying for an internship, I took up two projects, while simultaneously preparing for the upcoming tests. Tests began, and contrary to my expectations, I was not getting shortlisted anywhere. Until a few days prior to day 1, I only had one or two shortlists, in the companies I wasn‚Äôt interested in. I remember considering not appearing for Day 1 interviews, as once you get an offer on Day 1 you can‚Äôt reject it. Then two days before Day 1, I was giving Amex‚Äôs test, when Shubh messaged me about the release of shortists for a number of companies. I left the test midway to check them, and fortunately I was shortlisted in many of them. On the next day, I had GS‚Äôs interviews. The interview process was exhausting, as it required us to sit in front of a laptop for the entire day and we could be pulled into a Zoom breakout room for an interview at any moment. After enduring this tiring process, I went to bed early since Day 1 interviews were scheduled for the early morning. I was lucky enough to get an offer from my topmost preference (Quadeye) within half an hour of the start of day 1, which concluded my internship season :). The only major takeaway from this is to keep your calm, because this process is long and tiring. Things will not always pan out the way you want, but you still have to adapt and play along.",
      "During the third year, my routine was similar to the previous semesters ‚Äì waking up, attending lectures, completing assignments, and sleeping. The only significant change came when we were allowed to return to campus in the sixth semester, which was the best news we had received in a long time. Reuniting with my friends after a prolonged period of separation was a heartwarming experience. We were relocated to Hall-3, which had been closed for the past two years. Although adjusting there presented a new challenge, the joy of living with my wingmates again outweighed any discomfort. This semester was particularly hectic (just ask any CSE student about compilers :p). The only reprieve came in the form of the back-to-back fests ‚Äì Udghosh, Antaragni, and Techkriti. Eventually, the semester ended, and we went on our internships.",
      "The internship sure was an unforgettable experience, especially since many of my CSE friends were with me. The workload was intense. But the office parties were fun and we had a great time. We also had to do lab component of TA course during that time, which required us to submit a lab report on Mondays. So every Monday, after a tiring day at office, we would assemble in Yatharth‚Äôs room tocopytake reference from a mass-forwarded lab report. I not only made new friends but also discovered new places in Delhi-NCR, thanks to Ayush Shakya, the travel enthusiast (‚Äúbhanderlust‚Äù :p) of our group.",
      "Coming back in final year, I was determined to make the most out of this place, to have as much fun as possible. From going to OAT screenings, sneaking into Y22‚Äôs orientation with Akansh (ex core team member), spamming memes on instagram stories, playing the most NSFW guesstimates with Ajay, playing mini-militia and football with wingies, I did it all. I also joined the gym along with some of my wingies (Shoutout to Nilay, Alok, Shashank and Sunay ‚Äì The gymbros). I probably made more new contacts in final year than all other years. As I mentioned before, I became a tutor of the ESO207 course ‚Äì some juniors might know me from here. It was fun seeing the inner workings of a course and how many mails professors receive regarding the most trivial of things. The only downside was waking up on a Saturday morning for proctoring a quiz/exam. Placement season was approaching, which is really a one-of-a-kind experience here. I also assisted some of my close friends in placements. Sunay‚Äôs (the OPC) presence in our wing was a major asset, he helped the entire wing with the ‚Äústack‚Äù of resumes (inside joke lol). During placements, entire days went by being with friends in hall-12, finding walk-ins, prepping them etc. The times were tough, but we survived.",
      "In the last few days, I roamed around campus, trying to visit the places I had not yet visited, and relive the moments for the last time. We had various photoshoots, wing outings and the department farewell. Looking back, I can definitely say IITK has provided me with the best set of friends one could ever ask for, and luckily some of them would still be with me after I graduate. As for me, I am happy that I was able to do exciting things alongside some of the smartest and hardworking people in the country. IIT Kanpur is a place that offers a lot of opportunities and choices, but the time we have here is limited. So all I can say is go ahead, explore while you can and be accountable for your choices. If you‚Äôve read this till here, feel free to reach out to me in case you think I can help you in any way üôÇ ‚Äì All the best for your journey. Adios IITK, my second home ‚ù§Ô∏è.",

      "IIT Kanpur is a premier institute with state-of-the-art facilities. The opportunities for a student at IITK are vast, from exchange programs and sports facilities to clubs catering to almost all academic/non-academic interests. I have participated in the Adventure Club, Skating Club, Bicycling Society, Shiksha Sopan, Prayas, and Apna Skool. I got the opportunity to visit Europe for research and learn French and Japanese through the FLP program. I learnt swimming, spoke Sanskrit, practised yoga, and hit the gym.",
      "I feel honoured to experience different festivals celebrated by various (Odiya, Telugu, Marathi, Sikh, Bengali, Assamese) communities. I have enjoyed ravishing fests (cultural and technical) and listened to renowned invited speakers from myriad walks of life. Besides my professional research, the institute has provided me with the space where I routinely donated blood, learnt, and disseminated on multiple social issues (like spreading awareness for breast cancer, menstruation, socio-emotional understanding, and gender equality). I am grateful to the institute as it provided me with a fantastic place to stay and myriad opportunities to explore and grow. Through the institute, the city has become my home.",
      "Moreover, during my seven-year association, IITK stands out as a campus of paradoxes. I gained 10kg weight due to fantastic food. I got to experience academic rigour, benefitted from Health Centre (HC) services, and cherished the liberal environment where every student is treated as a responsible adult. I have seen, time after time, faculty standing with the students.",
      "I also stand witness to 5 suicides, the maximum number of students expelled for not fulfilling academic requirements in 2015, unprecedented protest against HC negligence which led to the death of a student in 2016, moral policing served as the panacea to various issues from time to time, and power abuse in a faculty-student intimate relationship in 2021. Some faculty employ school-going students (from marginalised communities) for their housekeeping. There is oblivion towards inhumane conditions of workers building/running the campus. There are not adequate checks or counselling for faculty",
      "The system needs tweaking. The faculty and students need to be regularly sensitised. The students need role models to emulate. Any act bereft of inclusion and compassion seems meaningless. I leave with the question, ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of the Institute? What is education? Why should research be belittling?‚Äù whose answer I could not find or did not align with at this premier institute.",

      "Further, I share the spark that kindled into a flame and the darkness that engulfed me during my stay on campus.",
      "Just beyond the campus walls, I discovered a world in stark contrast. The campus is in a privileged bubble, ignorant of the social challenges (poverty, child labour, bonded labour, illiteracy etc.) lingering beyond the walls. I have been proactively involved in educational activities for students from marginalised communities at different organisations (Shiksha Sopan, Prayas IITK, Asha Trust) in various roles (like, teaching volunteer, facilitator, Manager, executive member). With a dedicated team, I transitioned all educational activities online amidst the uncertainties of the pandemic for Prayas IITK (read the reporthere). Presently, I am volunteering to assist 40 children (class 3-12) of migrant labourers (Ek Kadam project) in their education who are first-generation formal learners of¬†their¬†families. It is no exaggeration that during volunteering in the company of the kids, I found meaning in life.",
      "Research is a continuous process that flows over all parts of a PhD student‚Äôs life. This leads to an increased prevalence of mental health problems among PhD students (Evans et al., 2018). Researchers have pointed out that work and organisational context significantly predict PhD students‚Äô mental health (Levecque et al. 2017). It is audacious to believe that broken minds will nurture positivity. Hence, a systematic change in mindset is needed to protect the researchers and save the system from a vicious cycle. I present excerpts from my journal to remind me that my troubles were fleeting. I hope every enduring researcher retains their interest. And I know many researchers struggling daily, whose difficulties might differ, but most would relate to my turmoil. In any case, you are not alone, and more love and strength to you.",
      "During this harrowing period, reaching out to counselling services took a lot of courage. And to my astonishment, the counsellors judged and gave unwanted suggestions with unprofessional insensitivity. Yet, I mustered the courage to return until I found Ansuma Sir, who listened to my rambling and gave me non-judgemental perspectives.",

      "The cost of pursuing a doctoral degree at IITK weighs heavy on me. I am fighting against a flow that others have shaped for me. I am not a pessimist but am reasonable enough to express my thoughts. I also have been selfish enough in voicing my thoughts, so please excuse my monologue.",
      "I am a reserved and private person. It makes me extremely uncomfortable sharing my difficulties. Please bear with me since reaching out is always my last option.",
      "With each week, it becomes tiring answering people about my graduation. My marriage prospects have been on hold for a year, and now my graduation is a constraint. With what certainty could I ask my partner to wait and fight for me as my family has been doing for so long? I would not like anyone else to get tired; tired because of my journey. My father will retire, and I can no longer delay overseeing the construction of our house. Is this only my journey, and at what cost? Family is the only particular reason that I endure each day.",
      "I need to be more confident, directed, intelligent, and capable of either research, writing, or other academic work. Being ambitious seems audacious to me at 32 years of age. I am saddened by the state I am in due to this journey. I have lost touch with most competitive exams, cannot fulfil ‚Äúminimal criteria to graduate‚Äù, have insufficient publications to compete and have no confidence in myself. It pushes me into a state of panic every time I ponder over the uncertainty bleeding all over my remaining future years.",
      "I have always disagreed with the normalised notion that ‚Äúpersonal and academic should be kept separate‚Äù. I do not concur with this coming from the faculty. This has been reiterated time and often in my department. Often, I have been stopped from voicing my struggles when I reached a tipping point of withholding it. I cannot fathom the sort of ‚Äúnational resource‚Äù I will become; if I am shattered from within.",
      "It has been two years now that I have been wasting institute resources. I have also ‚Äúwasted 90% of my work‚Äù during these years. I have been sieving sacks of aggregates and performing mix design for weeks and have yet to have a concrete plan. Equipment and material constraints have always led to months of lonely struggle. Research is said to happen this way, and I endure. I have been making sense of the work already done all these years, and clarity regarding completion still eludes me. I probably do not attach myself to the text for ‚Äúflawless thesis writing‚Äù because the text (work) keeps changing. I have always appreciated the progress seminar and observed how it had become an eyewash in my case.",
      "It would have been a fruitful journey if there had been an advisor (to listen to all) besides a supervisor. I expect not everyone to understand but my teachers to be compassionate and considerate because they have guided many people on this harrowing road. I feel uneasy about rushing and losing patience, but I am also still determining what I would magically learn here that I could not in 7 years. My dream of a career in academics seems fleeting too.",
      "I am tired, saturated, getting dumber and probably in a deadlock since I have lost faith in myself and my supervisor in me. I request someone to help me out of this, not one-on-one but through a group meeting. I wish to have that gleam of certainty through mutual discussion to hang on till I graduate. One struggle at a time, for I know it will not be a cakewalk even after graduation.",
      "I do not know if I am depressed, but I am confident of being extensively stressed. More than encouraging words from friends and well-wishers are needed. It feels like being trapped in a vicious tunnel with no light. I could keep moving, struggling, shouting, lighting a flame, but the vastness of the dark tunnel overwhelms me. A silent, lonely, dark place where I lose myself, trickle by a trickle. Is it better to end it all even for that? I have no courage, though I prefer it to happen organically. It would be a relief to this impasse. Taking agency of the self is a herculean task. Indecisiveness begets uncertainty and corrupts the vision altogether. Self-doubt and helplessness linger in my existence. Questions of meaningless; arise, scratch, provoke and deepens the expanse of the crisis. Being sensitive is a curse to the whole imbroglio. Being down will not get anything done, nor is pretending to be carefree or happy. The only option in sight is struggle, pain, and sorrow since quitting the battlefield is not in scope. The bearing of the trauma for the hope of finding the exit comes at a cost, and in light of the present situation, that cost cannot be justified. The accumulation of cortisol is at its brink. Time tick-tocks away as the whole exercise of the breakdown of self happens. I am confident when I overcome this, I won‚Äôt be happy, for the journey matters more than the result.",
      "Note to my future self on research:",
      "Heartbreak, financial debt, and no house built. Let me move beyond the campus shores for a different morning. Leave till thesis defence.",

The series is beyond the discussions of five friends sitting at McLaren‚Äôs or Barney‚Äôs playbook incidents or Ted‚Äôs hopeless romanticism; it is about life (people who watched HIMYM can relate).

      "It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the plethora of opportunities we get here, and we don‚Äôt know which will be beneficial, interesting, or life-changing for us in the long run. The decision to go for a branch change or stay and explore the current branch, the dilemma of choosing between research and corporate, studying hard enough for an ‚ÄòA‚Äô grade or prioritizing sleep (of course, mental peace matters during exams), or just follow the herd ‚Äì the list can get endless. The cherry on the cake was that I had always been an indecisive kid ‚Äì I always asked my mom or dad to make important decisions for me, be it selecting a T-shirt or choosing a college via JOSAA. But I understood it‚Äôs not a sin to make a wrong choice ‚Äì at least you know this particular option isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd be looking for in the future.",

      "Most of us have a thing for a particular cultural activity- be it singing, dancing, drawing, or photography. In my case, it was writing, so I fancied joining Vox Populi, the first of the many clubs/cells/societies I had been a part of. Among those few articles on which I got to work upon, I realised during the process that I loved interacting with people. I always used to look forward to the meetings, and those discussions were fruitful and interesting ‚Äì where the opinion of every member mattered irrespective of the hierarchy. Sitting home (idle) during COVID, I felt being a part of more clubs or societies would give me more interactions. So in my second year, I joined as many as six of them, and with everything being online, it was easy to manage tasks for each of them. Sometimes the meetings for two or even three clubs clashed, so I used to join all of them through different devices, hopping through each at different intervals. In an offline scenario, given the hectic academic schedule in the 3rd and 4th semesters, I definitely couldn‚Äôt have managed all of them. It‚Äôs not like I was influenced by seniors to join clubs, who circulated the famous tagline,‚ÄúClubs join karo to acchi job lagegi,‚Äùbut more out of self-interest. And I would also suggest my juniors at least join one club in their four years ‚Äì it‚Äôs fun participating in and conducting all those club events while making new bonds with new people ‚Äì because life here isn‚Äôt just about academics or placements.",
      "Online semesters were a new experience for all of us, and the process of giving exams and interacting with each other online seemed exciting at first. But it was after returning to campus I realised online sems robbed me of many valuable memories. I feel jealous of the club/cell core team parties and the bonds the current batches enjoy. Online interactions are so different and superficial than how people interact in person. Although from the academic‚Äôs point of view, I consider myself lucky to do the civil labs online ‚Äì I wonder how Y20s managed to do those geoinformatics labs in the sun! That definitely gives the students a ‚Äúcivil engineering‚Äù feel, something we Y19s missed/escaped (however you perceive it). But again, the disadvantages outnumbered those few advantages, and those two years were a big void in our college lives.",

      "I believe we are destined to fail in certain important tests of our life, only to take inspiration from them and come back stronger. Accepting failures gracefully is very important. There were many such ‚Äúfailures‚Äù for me, such as being unable to convert the Overall Coordinator of Outreach Cell interview, getting the lowest possible grade in a DC course, screwing up my placement interviews, not making enough bonds with people here- the list can get quite long. I won‚Äôt say those things didn‚Äôt hurt ‚Äì we all crave success and fame (and love), right? But if destiny has better plans for you, you can have an optimistic perspective on those results. So maybe don‚Äôt dwell much on the past that continues to hurt you, and focus on what lies in the future, maybe something even greater and amazing.",
      "",
      "Some courses are meant to influence us in multiple ways and be remembered even after graduation. One of my friends got interested in his department after doing a certain DC (Departmental Compulsory) course, which also guided him to choose a stream for his MS abroad. Although in my case, it wasn‚Äôt one but multiple DCs that made my interests drift further from my major and onto other fields. I found solace in statistics and the HSS courses (two very different fields), and somehow the respective instructors were also instrumental in helping me stay glued to them. I always liked playing with numbers, which encouraged me to take up four statistics courses, and the HSS courses provided me with a refreshing change from the hectic technical curriculum- be it knowing about the Indian society or South Asian languages- for me, reading about these things was more of a hobby than forced cramming.",

      "Not becoming an SG has to be one of the many things I missed the most. I won‚Äôt say I deserved to clear the interviews, or the then-core team was unfair (maybe they were, as most of us would still like to believe, but anyways), but it did hurt not being an SG during that time.Amusingly, none of my wingies (who applied) became an SG. I tried to compensate for it by being a part of many other clubs in my second year, and that disappointment gradually faded over time. I also applied for the core team of CS the next year, but I wasn‚Äôt serious about it at that time ‚Äì mainly because they expected us to not have any other major PoR beside it ‚Äì and I wanted to have multiple PoRs (silly thought-process, juniors please don‚Äôt just randomly go for multiple PoRs in your 3rdyear). I felt that regret of not being an SG again resurfacing in my last few days here when I saw Y19s sharing stories of them giving treats to theirbacchas/bacchis. There‚Äôs not much one can do in that situation, and sometimes you need to accept your fate as it is.",
      "‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not scared, you‚Äôre not taking a chance, and if you‚Äôre not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing?‚Äù",
      "It‚Äôs important to graduate without any regrets ‚Äì try everything you wish to do during college and don‚Äôt have regrets later on. The famous saying-‚ÄúYou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù‚Äì isn‚Äôt just meant to be admired in theory. I continued with a literature course in the last sem (an extra course), which required regular reading of novels, despite losing my reading habit some three years ago. I didn‚Äôt get the best grade in it, but it still helped me regain my reading skills. Performing in the Dance Extravaganza (DE) with my wingies was a memorable experience for me. After the fresher‚Äôs dance, I couldn‚Äôt get a proper opportunity to give a stage performance, and DE helped me fulfill that. Also, I gathered the courage to confess to my crush. The response wasn‚Äôt favourable (expected), but sharing my feelings with her was necessary, and I respected her sweet and mature response.",
      "I find it amusing to now remember that I had been a very homesick kid. Delhi being some 4-5 hours via train ‚Äì I used to run away home every month. In contrast, before leaving the campus recently, I delayed my homecoming till the very end to ensure I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything. Some say it‚Äôs the campus; others say it‚Äôs the people who make it worthwhile here. Both are irreplaceable in their aspects, and even if they don‚Äôt make up for a memorable four years of your IITK journey, they help you with the learnings you ought to inculcate for the future.",
      "Although I hope to be in touch with most of my peers, we know deep down that it won‚Äôt be the same again. Yet, as a legend once said-‚ÄúWhatever you do in this life, it‚Äôs not legendary unless your friends are there to see it.‚Äù(Barney is a legend) ‚Äì share your best moments with your friends. Life can be good by yourself. But, like everything else, the best experiences are always the ones you share with others.",

      "It‚Äôs a surreal feeling, from reading your favourite senior‚Äôs AWLs to writing one of your own, thinking, okay, do I even have something useful to tell about? Do I focus on the academic journey, the experiences in clubs and teams of IITK, the social life, or the unimaginably fun and borderline insane stories with the wingies? This is an attempt to summarize all my significant experiences and learning at this institute which has changed me forever.",
      "Fresh out of the celebration of JEE results, I arrived at Hall 13, a shy, introverted kid with the usual expectations of strict seniors, a high-paying FAANG job, long hours of studying, getting into a relationship (yeah, own it up, no shame lmao), and crazy fests. I was introduced to my SG Kshitij Kabeer, whom I‚Äôll luckily join in my graduate studies at CMU xD, and the ‚Äòupar se sharif, andar se harami‚Äô wingies. During the first few weeks of orientations and intro sessions, I made sure to break the shyness out of me and interact with as many seniors as possible. The ultimate goal, which I‚Äôve iterated to many juniors since, was to explore everything I had even a little interest in. We had followed a strict plan till now and left all our hobbies and interests behind during JEE, and the various student bodies of IITK were the perfect opportunity to explore. Glad to recollect I was heavily involved with the Robotics Club and the Electronics Club, earning the tag ‚Äòthe Arduino wala bacha‚Äô during Takneek. I explored my interests in photography by participating in Galaxy and football during Aagaz. I also dabbled in content writing and coverage for the fests Udghosh and Techkriti, which, sadly, Covid stripped away from us in 2019.",
      "Winter Camp was another amazing experience. For 14 days, we were grilled with work. With 4 hours of sleep in Kanpur‚Äôs bitter winter, I attended the winter camp for Electronics Club and Aerial Robotics Team with attending Robo Club‚Äôs lectures as well. The routine was simple, wake up at 9:50 for the 10 AM class, rush down, glancing over the anxious seniors waiting for interviews in Hall 13, attend lectures and workshops of clubs and teams till 8 PM, head back for dinner, play COD Mobile for 2 hours, complete assignments till 2 AM, bulla session till 4 AM and repeat! We looked like shit by the end of these two weeks, but this was when I learned the most during my undergrad.",
      "The first year was filled with jam sessions, flexing to each other about teams and clubs we got in, bulla sessions with SGs and wing ‚Äòbaapus,‚Äô pehla pehla heartbreak, and ****ing covid. Ah, covid!",
      "What was meant to be a meager one-week midsem break turned out to be a rollercoaster ride of nearly 3 semesters. I‚Äôll refrain from delving into the experiences during the Covid period as neither they are relevant to be part of the ‚ÄòIITK Jounrey‚Äô nor anyone really wants to hear that. Just the courses became quiz intensive with the number of quizzes in a week exceeding the number of days, and night out ‚Äòbullas‚Äô shifted to discord VCs, the canteen food was replaced by 2 AM Maggi in the kitchen, and everyone learned ‚Äòhow to google‚Äô efficiently hehe.",
      "Academically, during my second year, it became somewhat clear that the FAANG idea was not for me as I had somewhat made up my mind to pursue Robotics. I became the secretary of the Robotics Club and a member of the Aerial Robotics Team. I‚Äôve had some of the best times in this Team, and the seniors helped us immensely, from debugging the silliest errors to teaching us to work independently. We worked towards participating in InterIIT Tech Meets and international competitions. The community one forms in these entities is one, I believe, that sticks around the longest apart from your wing-mates. Even today, we have random conversations with the members of the Team, both senior and junior to us, with some seniors pursuing robotics in the most notable universities and some working towards their own startups. The motivation and inspiration that I got from everyone on the Team changed my work ethic and attitude immensely, and for that, I‚Äôm thankful to my seniors.",
      "Shortly began the second year summer of the IITK UG, and I had to make the ultimate decision to whether to prepare for a corporate internship or aim for a foreign research internship. It was clear to me that I loved Robotis and hated CP. After some conversations with seniors, a little self-hyping, and preparing myself to face insecurities, I decided to not sit for internship tests and focus on cold mailing and research internship programs. After making a heavy 300-350 list of professors and 15-20 programs, I began the process in late August. When I was regularly mailing professors and applying for programs during the months leading up to December, most of my friends had already secured internships, and that‚Äôs when the insecurities crept in. I held firm, believed in my process and my profile, and started getting some positive responses. After declining a few remote opportunities, I was selected for the MITACS Research internship program in December. Finally, I slept like a baby for the first time in 3 months without having to worriedly check my emails in the morning. As a side note, I‚Äôve cooked up a very basic guide for apping in Robotics, and feel free to contact me for the same. I hope it makes the process a little bit less troublesome.",
      "It was the 6th semester when we were called back. One would think it would be weird when we came back, right, I mean not having seen each other for nearly 2 years, but ‚Äòboys hostel kuch alag hi hota hai‚Äô. The minute we opened our dusty rooms, we were back with random water fights, endless nsfw conversations, 2 AM Maggi in canteens, dancing to Bollywood item songs, and finally feeling like college students again.Everyone just wanted to experience the semester, or what was left of it, to the fullest before leaving for their internships in third-year summers. IITK had changed somewhat with new rules, different food outlets, and 2 batches of juniors, but it was still home. This was also the time to say our goodbyes to our favorite Y18s and regularly hang out in Hall 1, taking in all the ‚Äògyaan‚Äô.",
      "After completing my tenure as the Team Head of the Aerial Robotics Team, I decided to contest for the Associate Head Teams position in the SnT Council, which led to a tiresome 4-hour interview/debate session. I remember calling my wingies outside senate hall at 3 AM to bring me some food and coke as I was dead tired. After this, the newly elected Gensec and we three AHs were faced with the task of conducting the SnT Code, the hallmark event of Takneek, for all the Halls. The preparations, the fights, the accusations, the contentions, and the frustrations were all completely different experiences and I believe these helped a lot in polishing my communication skills as well as leadership skills. This semester helped me realize the importance of having a dynamic personality, adjusting, handling frustrations, and still working under immense pressure. Another important lesson passed down by a beloved senior is ‚Äòcompartmentalize karna sikho‚Äô. Still trying to do that and whole-heartedly passing it down to juniors whenever I get a chance; thanks, Ashwin!",
      "As the summers started, we bid adieu to Y18s and headed off to our internships. I remember frantically packing before my flight to Canada on 6th May 2022. The last-minute thing tbh becomes a habit in college, not something I would suggest being proud about though haha. The internship was another invaluable experience: learning to live and work in an entirely different place, managing food prep, costs, and rent, and traveling to some of the best cities of east coast Canada. Some of the most amazing moments were catching a sunrise at Niagra Falls, sitting by the pier stargazing near river Ontario in Toronto, attending the Kygo concert in Montreal, and sneaking in drinks in a club in Ottawa. With my friends being in different time zones, it was always tough for us to stay in touch, but luckily we had messed up sleep schedules, so getting on a quick call was always possible. Conversations filled with rants from India, Europe, the US, and Canada will always stay with me from that time.",
      "During the internship, I loved working on a research project, and the idea of solving a new problem seemed intriguing. The professor was extremely kind to help me at each step and regular interactions, thanks to the training at IITK, with graduate students from varied cultures cemented by the idea of pursuing graduate studies after my completing my undergrad. Without delving into more details of the internship, let‚Äôs dive back to IITK",
      "The internships ended, and everyone came back for the final year with a plethora of experiences to share and more mature personalities; okay not fully mature, but you can‚Äôt really expect us to behave when we get together. The 7th semester is supposed to be a serious one, as is this paragraph, where some are tediously working towards the placement season, and some are writing numerous iterations of SoPs to apply to universities. This semester was all about getting that perfect profile to apply for grad schools and seriously hoping the decision to not sit for placements wasn‚Äôt a bad one. I took relevant courses this sem and started working under Prof. Twinkle Tripathy through a UGP which I continued in my final semester as well.",
      "(A side note I‚Äôm working on creating a guide for grad school applications with info regarding GRE, LoRs, and SoPs as well, to any juniors who are interested, feel free to reach out for the same)",
      "This semester was also filled with interactions with numerous juniors regarding internships, courses, and finally, the reality of being in the final year set in. We were placed in Hall 9, which eventually turned out to be a blessing in disguise as our wing made it routine to hang out on the rooftop solar panels lying down and watching the sunset. Decorating the rooms and the wing was always our thing. As expected, each room felt like a gaming zone with LED lights, dual monitors, posters and art on the wall, and fidgety electronics lying around all the time. Everyone plugging in for playing Valorant with a drink and chips, light off and LEDs on, shouting and swearing till our throat hurt, is a core memory that will stay with me for a long time, one I will miss the most as everyone‚Äôs moving away. Another would be 4-5 of us going to the gym regularly, not pointing fingers, but those who skipped you know who you are xD, motivating each other in the psychologically unhealthiest ways possible haha, and coming back to have a samosa chai in the canteen.",
      "As the sem ended, everyone became serious with long nights of placement interviews and, for me, long applications to universities, finishing up my SoP as usual at the last minute, gathering and sorting up my Letter of Recommendation, and praying for acceptance. Once again, this is for people planning to apply for grad schools; remember the insecurities faced during intern season as, once again, your friends are placed in December already, and we have to wait till March for the results of grad school applications.",
      "The last semester! As the dust of placement season and graduate school applications settled, we began our last semester with the worry of making sure we complete our credits haha. With both fests, Antaragini and Techkriti lined up, we were just happy to experience that rush one last time before we left. All this, along with the pressure of the InterIIT Tech Meet being hosted by Kanpur, the General Championship, handing over elections, and the cliche boys Goa trip lined up, made this semester full of moments.",
      "First was the InterIIT Tech Meet, personally my third. This time taking on more of a managerial role allowed me to interact with and identify juniors and help them lead the problem statements. Next came the GC, and the campus was vivid again, showing glimpses of our first year with all the halls working non-stop for the events in GC. We (us core team members of SnT) geared up for Takneek and even though it was frustrating and very tiresome to conduct the SnT Code again, I‚Äôm sure we loved every moment of it. Looking back, the fights, the arguments, the SnT room meetings, and getting those first reactions while tallying up the points remain the best moments from Takneek. Next came the fests, and they were so beautiful. We felt like first years again, dancing and jumping endlessly in pro-nites, heading to Hall 11 for dinner to avoid the rush, roaming around with a camera, getting a temporary tattoo on the neck, and having random jam sessions after everyone got tired.",
      "The last few weeks were tough to process. We tried to just live like we always did, slog through the end-sems, and just try to capture this beautiful campus as much as possible. Recording songs at 3 AM in the hall, watching the feel-good Priyadarshan movies, random outings to Zsquare to window shop, heading up to the rooftop whenever it rained, exploring random rooftops in the Acad area (legit a checklist should be made for this haha), our standard order at Hall 11 canteen of four rice and chicken curries, farewell photoshoots, and jam sessions with every person I could find with a guitar is how I will remember the last few days. Of course, mixed with the worry of passing in EE301 ( don‚Äôt leave both basket DEs for the last sem batti walon ). Meeting so many people for the last time became somewhat easier as I continued to live in denial and refuse to accept that college was finally getting over. With final hugs and goodbyes, I can fully accept I did break down on the auto ride out of the campus. In those 5 minutes, around 5 PM, 8th May 2023, each turn and path of IITK flashed a memory, some good, some bad but all I‚Äôll keep close to my heart. Writing ‚Äòpass out‚Äô while exiting the hall gate and finally submitting the gate pass at the main gate felt so suffocating, and the campus never looked so serene.",
      "As I leave, I take away with me so many good memories, invaluable learnings, crazy experiences, and of course, what I learned from my courses :P, and I am thankful to every person I met here. This place took in a shy kid and gave me a small family that will now be spread all across the world. Thanks to these beautiful souls FyeD, Terren, and Muffin, for the late-night VCs that kept me sane during Covid. Thanks, Tanidroid, for the chori wale coolers. Thanks to Pixel, Blueboi, and Hackeryg for those jam sessions!",
      "If I may leave the juniors with some piece of advice, it would be this, JEE was a rat race, but this doesn‚Äôt have to be. Now is the time you can actually find out what you‚Äôre good at, and IITK would give you an opportunity to pursue that as a career. Explore as much as possible, make crazy friends, don‚Äôt fret over things you cannot control, sing, dance, fill your time here with experiences, and also haan! thoda sa study bhi.",
      "And the people who‚Äôve met me know I say this all the time, but for the last time here, ‚ÄòKuch ho toh message karlena, baat karke ho jayega sort‚Äô.",

      "First of all, a short note on my academic journey at IITK. During JoSAA, I had to choose between EE and MTH at IITK, and simply based on instincts, I decided to rank MTH higher than EE. As fate would have it, I decided to pursue an academic career in mathematics, a path taken by very few in general, especially in our institute. In my first year, I was hell-bent on changing my branch to CSE and making a shit ton of money. That did not work out, but I spent my first ~3 semesters studying many courses that would broadly fall under the umbrella of ML/AI and dabbling in competitive coding now and then.",
      "",
      "Over time, I grew bored of ML/AI (partly due to what a mess academic research in these subjects has become) and lost all interest in coding; I was just interested in the theoretical aspects. So, to try something new, I decided to spend more time doing pure mathematics, and I liked it so much that I never turned back!",
      "",
      "During my fourth semester, my disinterest in typical corporate life and most academic disciplines besides math became clear to me. So I decided to invest all my energy into pure math and to get into a good school for graduate studies (which worked out pretty well, I‚Äôd say.) In short, my career trajectory was very unpredictable during the first few years, and I found something I enjoyed doing only after investing significant time in its search.",
      "",
      "I believe college life is an avenue for exploration to figure out one‚Äôs true interests‚Äîsomething that you shall, without second thoughts, enjoy doing for the rest of your life if you have to. It is a voyage of discovery, but this voyage is multifaceted and not limited to one‚Äôs career trajectory. It is a process of self-discovery and understanding one‚Äôs place and role in society as an individual. It is a time to unlearn and challenge one‚Äôs previously-learned notions and stereotypes. In this process, it is essential to ask questions and find answers.",
      "The majority of your IITK experience will be influenced by the people you spend most of your time with. Choose wisely. It might be challenging to find like-minded people but don‚Äôt feel pressured into being around people whose mindset and values don‚Äôt match yours, and don‚Äôt feel obligated to invest your time in activities that don‚Äôt align with your goals or that you‚Äôre disinterested in.Mieux vaut √™tre seul que mal accompagn√©. (Better to be alone than in bad company.)",
      "For instance, I never participated in any inter- or intra-hall events or club activities. I am not discouraging anyone from doing so; I am pointing out that it is not necessary to do what everyone else does, and it is okay to walk the road less traveled. Enjoying what you do is far more important than following the crowd. At IITK, I found very few people with similar interests and mindsets, but that did not deter me from pursuing my goals. In every batch, very few (almost none) MTH UGs are interested in graduate studies in pure math, and at least among students in the department, there isn‚Äôt a culture of engaging in insightful academic discussions. Regardless, most professors are pretty open to such chats, and I‚Äôm grateful to the department for its support over the years. I‚Äôve also learned a lot from folks in academia outside of IITK, and I‚Äôd encourage reaching out to anyone you‚Äôre interested in working or chatting with. Never hesitate to write (but don‚Äôt write anything stupid) to anyone! Lastly, work so hard that you never regret not giving your best, and everything will work out in the end.",
      "While research may not be for everyone, trying it out can provide valuable experience and help develop transferable skills. It is common knowledge that most IITK UGs never try research in any discipline and settle for the tried-and-tested route toward a typical corporate lifestyle. There is nothing wrong with this approach, and it works for many; however, I shall offer a different perspective. There is plenty to learn and gain from research experiences as an undergraduate, and if you do not intend to go to graduate school, this is pretty much the only phase of your life when you can experiment with research. Why regret not doing it later?",
      "In my specific case, I did not understand the appeal of (mostly monotonous) corporate jobs (partly due to a certain lack of freedom). I wanted to challenge myself and grow constantly. My summer intern experience went quite well and solidified my commitment to an academically demanding career. Mathematics, in general, and research, in particular, help me escape the monotony of everyday life and feel mentally fresh. I believe everyone should have such experiences and that merely financial gratification can only provide short-term satisfaction in life. Whether or not you do research, it may be helpful to have a more profound sense of purpose in life beyond just fulfilling materialistic desires so that no matter the challenges life throws at you, you always have a foundation to fall back on.",
      "I have noticed a weird approach towards academics in IITK (across batches), and I will present a perspective contrary to what might please most ears. I have seen plenty of students preparing for exams just a day or two before and skipping classes often. The result of it all, with high probability, is a bad grade on one‚Äôs transcript. In most cases, the students conveniently shift the ‚Äúblame‚Äù to the instructor‚Äôs teaching skills and evaluation methods rather than mending their own ways.",
      "",
      "I do not think anyone deserves to call a STEM class ‚Äúhard‚Äù unless they pay constant attention and put honest, sincere efforts into reading the text and practicing problems. The truth is, no undergraduate class is particularly ‚Äútough,‚Äù and any reasonably smart person (as you‚Äôd expect anyone joining IITK to be) can get a decent grade in most of them withconsistent effort. That being said, not everyone necessarily aims to get good grades in every course, and many students have other non-academic life goals, which is okay!",
      "By far, this has been the hardest part to pen down. IITK taught me many things. First, I began to appreciateoubaitori, the Japanese concept of never comparing oneself. Everyone grows at their own pace and in their own way. We all step foot into IITK from a highly competitive environment, and as inertia would have it, it is challenging to grow out of this mindset as college life begins. However, college is when most of us try to figure out a career path for ourselves‚Äîan entirely individual choice. What makes most people happy may not make you happy, and it is up to you to listen to and follow your heart.",
      "As Steve Jobs said,‚ÄúHave the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.‚ÄùMany people talk about ‚Äúfinding oneself‚Äù during undergrad, but I think this journey is really about returning to who you truly are. Who are you beneath all the layers of social conditioning, cultural norms, and people‚Äôs judgments? I hope you, the reader, find an answer. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you who or where you need to be by a certain age.You are exactly where you need to be right now!",
      "College is where most of us make friends for life, and I‚Äôm grateful to have had the opportunity to interact with people from different backgrounds with varied ambitions and interests. Some of them are now the reason I call IITK home. On the flip side, though, I also learned a lot from the relationships that did not last. I genuinely believe that people come into our lives at specific times to teach us lessons about ourselves and the world around us. Not everyone is meant to stay forever, and that‚Äôs okay. In fact, it is this impermanence that makes life beautiful. If something lasted forever, would we really appreciate it? Perhaps this is why nature has seasons, too. I feel the same about my time at IITK; its impermanence helped me realize its true value.",
      "Lastly, and perhaps the most important, is the unpredictable nature of life (at IITK or just in general.) One can never predict what life will throw at them, and at times, such surprises aren‚Äôt fun. Regardless, they are learning experiences. There will be times when you bike across campus to a friend‚Äôs impromptu birthday party, and there will be days when you find peace in your own company. Life never goes exactly as planned, and that‚Äôs alright. There are always new experiences to have, new people to meet, and memories to make when you least expect them. Time flies by; make the most of it while it lasts!",

Voice exercise, 5 rounds of foyer, 2 a.m. chai and parathas, 0/1 expressions, emotions on 1-10, medley, par/ floodlights and many more routine things will be hard to leave all of a sudden. A group of individuals coming together to create something out of nothing but themselves and their voices (i.e., nukkad natak), is something that awes me even today. Many people discouraged me from continuing the club because of rational reasons like the intense practice hours, pressure on acads, club-centric life, etc. However, the emotional center always wins out and now here I am. Acted, directed, produced, wrote, sang and performed a decent number of good plays/mimes/monologues, with zero regrets, because in the end it all worked out in miraculous ways like it always does. A few productions that will always remain close to me: ‚ÄòAndhera Hone tak‚Äô, ‚ÄòAkhandta ka Dhol‚Äô, ‚ÄòBaaki Itihaas‚Äô, ‚ÄòThen there were none‚Ä¶‚Äô and ‚ÄòDharam Sankat me hai‚Äô.",

As a person who went from waking up before sunrise to opening eyes after noon, I would undoubtedly say that night life campus experience is much much better. A whole new spectrum of places and people unlocks as the moon rises and one can see high density of masses roaming around OAT, academic area, MamaMio, etc. The night life for the initial part of my college journey was restricted to the LHC foyer or Drams room, which was not that bad except for the treacherous amount of mosquitos. But in the final months of college, I explored various places like the LHC rooftop, Mech building rooftop, Technopark, etc., which forced me to appreciate the architectural beauty of our campus. Even the smallest symmetries of rooftop structures are just mesmerising. So, do explore the beauty of campus while you can.",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Upon my arrival at IIT Kanpur, I eagerly anticipated a plethora of novel experiences. However, the unforeseen emergence of COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the lives of countless individuals, leaving an indelible mark on our collective consciousness. In the midst of those challenging moments, my thoughts often turned to the students, professors, workers, and countless others who found themselves confined to the campus. As a student at IITK, I came to the realization that it was our responsibility to help our community during these challenging times. In light of the pandemic, a group known as the‚ÄúQuick Response Team‚Äùwas established.",
      "As I leave, I would like to put forward the story of our team.",
      "In the early days of the pandemic, amidst the chaos and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, a collective of individuals with a strong sense of purpose came together to form the Quick Response Team.",
      "Comprising a dedicated team including Shivam Nigam, Rajnessh Dubey, Anshika Singh, Kamini Singh, Surbhi Gupta, Shivam Trivedi, Amarjeet Kene, Rishabh Katiyar, Yash, Shambhavi, Nitin Chokhat, Sraddha, Vaibhav, Aman, Rishikesh Mishra, and Rajat Gupta, our united mission was to aid and serve those facing the challenges presented by this unprecedented situation.",
      "Driven by a shared passion for the welfare of our community, we tirelessly worked to provide assistance and guidance to individuals in need. Together, we sought to bring clarity amidst the confusion and lend a helping hand during these trying times.",
      "Our Quick Response Team demonstrated exceptional dedication and commitment to serving the IITK community during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our relentless efforts aimed to provide immediate support and assistance to those in need, showcasing our unwavering dedication and selflessness.",
      "One of the team‚Äôs core activities was actively monitoring the‚ÄúCOVID Emergencies in IITK‚Äùtelegram group, where we promptly responded to emergency requests. Our swift action in providing accurate and up-to-date information regarding the availability of vital resources such as oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, and medicines proved invaluable in helping individuals access the necessary healthcare they required.",
      "Recognizing the significance of information dissemination, we developeda chatbotthat effectively addressed people‚Äôs queries about COVID-19. This initiative not only alleviated concerns but also empowered individuals with reliable information, contributing to the overall well-being of the community.",
      "The team‚Äôs proactive approach extended to facilitating plasma and blood donations, emphasizing the importance of these life-saving contributions. By raising awareness and organizing donation drives, we played a vital role in connecting potential donors with recipients in need, thereby fostering a sense of unity and compassion within the community.",
      "Understanding the challenges faced by vulnerable individuals, the Quick Response Team undertook the crucial responsibility ofdoor-to-door meal delivery. Our compassionate act ensured that those unable to procure essential sustenance were not left without nourishment, showcasing our genuine concern for the well-being of each community member.",
      "In addition to our on-the-ground efforts, our team developed online databases and resources that operated around the clock. By providing real-time updates and live assistance, we became a dependable source of information, offering vital support to those seeking guidance and aid.",
      "Furthermore, our Quick Response Team extended financial assistance to individuals who were facing hardship due to the pandemic. Our timely and compassionate response to such situations had undoubtedly provided much-needed relief to those struggling, reaffirming our commitment to the well-being of the entire IITK community.",
      "As a team, we divided our work into different segments to ensure that we could provide comprehensive support to the community. The first group focused on developing websites[1]and chatbots[2]and updating the data regularly. The second group provided oxygen cylinders and hospital beds to COVID-19 patients. The third group focused on providing plasma and blood donations. The fourth group provided door-to-door meal delivery and delivered medicines and other health care items.",
      "Our team achieved many milestones during the pandemic. We provided assistance tomore than 2000 people, and we conducted over 500 consultations with doctors. We helped arrange1200 oxygen cylinders and provided 1550 hospital bedsto COVID-19 patients. We also provided plasma and blood donations to 255 people, and we delivered meals to 1500 households. Our team also conducted awareness drives about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. We organized online workshops on COVID-19-related topics and invited doctors to give talks and answer questions from the community. We also shared information about the government‚Äôs guidelines and protocols regarding COVID-19 and vaccination.",
      "One of the major challenges we faced was the shortage of resources like oxygen cylinders and hospitalbeds. We worked tirelessly to find and provide verified resources to those in need. We also developed an oximeter library where people could borrow oximeters for home monitoring of oxygen levels. We provided financial assistance to those who were struggling due to the pandemic. We collaborated with various organizations and individuals to collect funds and distribute them to those in need. We also set up a support group for people in home isolation. Members of the group regularly checked on the health of the individuals in isolation and provided emotional support. We also provided counseling services to those who were struggling with mental health issues due to the pandemic.",
      "As a team, we worked around the clock to ensure that the members of the IITK community had access to all the necessary resources and support during these difficult times. The encouraging comments and recognition we received from the community inspired us to do our best work.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for everyone, and it has required a collective effort to overcome. Our Quick Response Team¬† worked tirelessly to provide essential resources to people who needed them, and achieved many milestones. Our team‚Äôs efforts had a significant impact on the IITK community, and we hope that our work inspires others to step forward and help.",

They encouraged us to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Their trust in our abilities and their willingness to provide us with the necessary resources and support were crucial to our success. Their words of encouragement and appreciation gave us the confidence tokeep going, even when things seemed overwhelming.",
      "As I look back at our journey during the pandemic, we are grateful for the support and guidance provided by these individuals. We acknowledge and appreciate their contributions to our efforts, and we are honored to have had the opportunity to work with them.",
      "I hope the Quick Response Team‚Äôs story becomes an inspiration for many. Our dedication and selflessness reminds people that even in the toughest of times, there were those willing to lend a hand and make a difference.",
      "And so, the team‚Äôs legacy lives on‚Äîa testament to the power of ordinary individuals coming together to create extraordinary impact. We proved that a small group of dedicated people can change lives and bring hope when it‚Äôs needed most.",

I luckily landed an internship at a US-based startup and got to work with the early-stage team. Let me tell you, working in a startup is an adventure in itself, basically a real-life version of ‚ÄúThe Pursuit of Happyness.‚Äù! I got a chance to learn a lot about running a business, not just from the product or technical side but from various dimensions that are necessary to build a successful company. Plus, it gave a much-needed boost to my real part of the ‚Äúc‚Äù variable.",
      "And with this newfound confidence, I went on to secure an internship at Microsoft in my third-year internship season.",
      "Finally, this episode comes to an end with the thrilling news that we will be summoned back to campus, bringing an end to the hectic online semester",

      "Life is full of ups and downs; sometimes, a hiccup can become a disaster. But, as they say, what doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger! While I was over the moon about returning to campus, something personal happened that knocked my self-esteem. To make matters worse, I also have a serious health disorder. I was in a dark place for almost a month, feeling down and out. But then, my friends and some amazing people who entered my life helped me gain a new perspective. They brought out the best in me and helped me grow in ways I never thought possible. We all know how it feels to go through a rough patch. But little did I know that plunging into physical activities would not only help me recover from this misery but also give me a completely new identity. As I went through my journey, Anuv Jain‚Äôs song ‚ÄúGul‚Äù became my anthem.",
      "Now, if I were to write my college life story, it would span across six episodes, but as a person, I‚Äôm two entirely different individuals pre- and post-this incident. My physique has certainly evolved, but the real change I felt was in my attitude.",
      "These changes may not have contributed to any real or imaginary part of the above-mentioned variable. Still, they certainly added a new dimension to my life, boosting its overall efficiency.",
      "College life can be tough, and sometimes we go through those gut-wrenching moments that leave us feeling like a shaken soda can. But fret not, my friend; patience and faith are the secret ingredients to making it through. Trust me, time is a funny guy, and he makes even the worst situations seem like distant memories.",
      "And you know the best part? Like a good old-fashioned software update, these incidents can turn us into a 2.0 version of ourselves. So, while waiting for the update to install, don‚Äôt be afraid to make new friends! They might become the peanut butter to your jelly or the Batman to your Robin.

      "And let me tell you, this was the episode to end all episodes, as I was finally able to create a perfect balance between the imaginary and real parts of my complex variable ‚Äúc.‚Äù From trekking in Annapurna, Nepal, and being a part of the Udghosh core team to juggling between MTH courses and exploring business roles in an internship at a Singapore-based company, it was a bit overwhelming at times, but it taught a lot about time management.",
      "The funny thing is, if you had told me during my first year of college that I would be doing all of this in my final year, I would have thought you were crazy! But it just goes to show that we are capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for. I mean, in my first year, I barely passed my morning PE course, but now I was waking up at 5 a.m. for the deadly adventure club conditioning every day. Crazy how things change, right?",
      "In this episode of my college journey, the dreaded placement season was also upon us. Luckily, I landed a pre-placement offer, making all the other adventures possible. But it wasn‚Äôt just about me; I had to help my friends with their job hunts. And you know what? Seeing them succeed was one of the most fulfilling experiences I‚Äôve had so far.

Talk about being on top of the world!",
      "Leading a group of 15 trekkers was tough, but it was an enriching experience! It taught me the true essence of leadership: setting the right pace for the team, motivating teammates who were ready to give up, and finally leading them to the summit.

      "Lakshita has also been a huge motivator in my life, but in a slightly different way. You see, I have a bit of a problem when it comes to eating meals regularly. But thanks to her constant reminders, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm eating three square meals daily.",
      "Of course, not everything in life is roses and unicorns. And I had Parmar, Tanisha, DJ, and Deshanki to lean on through it all. When times were tough, they stood by me, and for that, I will always be thankful.",
      "Next, there‚Äôs Nikhil, who made working in Udghosh fun.",
      "And then there‚Äôs Bansal. The guy who stayed overnight with me in the hospital when I was admitted",
      "Up next is Govind, the bro who gets you all the fun possible.",
      "Then I have Ananya, who is the best Gen Z sister I could ever ask for. Our bond transcends mere siblinghood, as we traverse the realm of conversations, delving into the intricate tapestry of other people‚Äôs lives and the nuances of our own. Together, we have forged timeless memories, treasures of the heart that hold immeasurable value, far surpassing any material possession.",
      "And last but not least, there‚Äôs Yatish. The guy who has been instrumental in making me who I am today.",
      "Looking back on my journey, I am so happy with how everything turned out. I owe everything to these people and this place, which allowed me to discover myself and become the person I am today.",
      "Who knows if there will be a second season of this web series or what else life has in store for me? But what I do know is that the experiences and lessons I have learned here at IITK will stay with me for a lifetime. It‚Äôs been an incredible ride, and I am excited to see where it takes me next.

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "",
      "I decided not to take up my job and join IIT Kanpur (IITK) for my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. That was the only way I could have extended my college life, where I could enjoy the process of learning and working on my own time. To be honest, I found people more excited about me joining IITK for my Ph.D. than I was. My entire family visited me just after a month of joining the campus. Initially, during coursework, life was very streamlined, waking up in the morning, attending classes, going to the gym, and having food three times in Hall 8. However, after a couple of months, I realized that I was not the best of the students academically and must put in a lot of work to get things through. I was very good at sports even before I joined IIT, and I remember one of my friends asking me if I was studying in sports quota! (Disclaimer: Sports quota does not exist in Ph.D. at IITs)",
      "After a year, I finished coursework and started full-fledged research. Managing my research alongside my passion for weightlifting seemed daunting. The next couple of years were hard labor without any fruits. On the academic front, I did not have a single publication. On the sports front, although I won several state and district championships, before the Inter IIT competition, I felt sick, and I couldn‚Äôt win Gold just for a few kilos. I remember dropping five kilos of body weight in one week during the competition and feeling like an alien with the added grief of missing an expected Gold Medal. To add to this, my friends who joined IITK with me for their Masters completed their degrees and left the college. This was quite a difficult phase for me, but I told myself, ‚ÄúThis too shall pass,‚Äù and I strived on.",
      "The following year was a year of rewards where my publications started coming in and my room became so full of medals and cups that I had to keep some of them in my friend‚Äôs room. I even remember him lying to one of his friends that the trophies were his! Truth be told, I started having my stroke of lady luck in this phase as well!",
      "I was cruising through reaping the benefits of my hard work when a mid-life crisis set in. While coming back from IIT Kharagpur after winning the gold medal, my team-mate suggested that I should take charge of sports at IIT Kanpur as the sporting culture of the campus was going down, and our performance as a team in the Inter IIT was dismal. After a thought, I gave it a go and contested the election for General Secretary of Games and Sports. During campaigning, I got to see so many sides of people that the entire process became a huge learning experience. I made so many friends, and I lost so many during the elections. Sadly, I heard one 1st year student saying, ‚ÄúHum PG wale ko vote nehi karenge.‚Äù I have never personally seen this divide before. However, I won the elections by a huge margin, and I was the first Ph.D. student to become the General Secretary for Games and Sports Council at IIT Kanpur.",
      "One month after I became the General Secretary, COVID-19 set in. All the plans and programs changed rapidly with every passing day. To keep the sporting community engaged, several online events were held. I remember IIT Kanpur winning the Fit-India challenge hosted by IITs and supported by actor Sunil Shetty. Several steps were taken for revamping the official handles of sports at IIT Kanpur and no stone was left unturned to do whatever could be done during an online semester.",
      "In the end, I was awarded Institute Blues, an award given for extraordinary achievements and tremendous contribution towards sports on the campus. Academically I ended up doing fairly well, bagging publications in reputed journals and winning an award at an AIAA conference in Chicago. I earned an opportunity to work at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for my post-doc.",
      "",
      "It is always about the journey and not the destination. Words can‚Äôt adequately express how important my friends have been to me over my six years at IITK. Without including our numerous talks on a variety of subjects during our lunch, dinner, and evening tea breaks, as well as the travels we have planned together, this journey would be incomplete. If they hadn‚Äôt given my life enough humor, jokes, and puns, my stay would have been dull and monotonous. The biggest reward is LOVE.",

      "There is no combination of words and there is no amount of time that would let me write an as we leave I am happy with because there is no way to communicate what can only be lived. It was stormy the first time I sat down to write this. Sporadic showers of rain coming and going without any notice. It seems to come all at once, it feels like the sky might fall out. The first time it rained in this time in this intense summer heat, in the middle of exams we went to the connector block terrace. The sheer shock of the relief independently drew all of us in. We played our little makeshift games making a football out of an empty water bottle and imagination. I remembered I had a ball in my room. I find it so amusing that I have all of these things that will only find use in this incredibly specific little time only. Like their life is tied to that moment with an elastic string. And I remember running back with the ball in the corridor, trying my best not to slip. My bare feet against the wet marble floor. I had to run because it would end at any minute, it would end, it would stop raining.",

      "I think life consists of the little moments strung together. This AWL makes no attempt to recount the big moments. They mean nothing in isolation. The relief felt after a big deadline. The cup of coffee shared in the ten minutes between classes. A cold drink of water in sweltering May heat. A TT match won(at least attempting to). Laughing at your friend reading the sign ‚Äòno pedestrians allowed‚Äô as ‚Äòno pescatarians allowed‚Äô. Not knowing what metro station to get down at. Crying from laughter. Falling off your cycle. Building relationships with the IITK dogs. The delight in realising there are multiple tripods. Butterscotch and Lodu in the road between Hall 4 and GH1 at daybreak. 4 am DOAA canteen breaks. Finding ‚Äòyour‚Äô table unoccupied. Samosas shared after film studies class. Hot soupy DCBM on freezing January nights. Canceled classes. Extended deadlines. Salami sandwiches* made with only a kettle. The ‚Äòlook‚Äô shared between friends. Being asked to turn the volume down. I can‚Äôt miss an institute, what is an institute? But I can miss the little stairs cut into the stage in front of L20 and I will miss Ganesh the monitor lizard.",
      "It terrifies me to leave. It terrifies me to move outside this place because I have always known what I am supposed to do here, with clean, neatly defined guidelines. Wake up on time, don‚Äôt skip breakfast, go to class every day, do the work assigned to you, pursue projects, engage in extracurricular activities, get PORs, get an internship, get a job. I think everyone actually always knows what they‚Äôre supposed to do. The problem is always in doing it to state the obvious. It has become a little difficult for me to write about this place with affection because I cannot handle that I am leaving. It goes without saying that this place changes you beyond recognition but you also see it change with you and all of us have this sort of collective amnesia where we immediately accept it as it is.",

      "I remember the time before CCTV cameras when the streetlights were a warm yellow. I remember the time before the shiny new buildings in the academic area did not even exist, and who knows how shiny and new they are going to remain. I remember before the fountain was constructed in front of the library before bookshelves were replaced by desks on the first-floor area close to the main staircase. I remember a time before you had to sign in and out at the main gate when going outside the campus. Before CCD was renovated. Before CCD needed to be renovated. Time is a flat circle. Looking at the newest batch occupying the center table makes me think about how every inch of this campus is significant for someone somewhere butthe meaning keeps getting rewritten every day.",

      "What is campus culture? I don‚Äôt really know. There are a few instantiations like kholna which continue to be transmitted but outside it, it‚Äôs something people keep referencing when truly we did not inherit what it was supposed to be. Campus culture is something that is internalized and enacted by exposure to the pre-existing community. Even much before covid seniors have bemoaned its loss, and our batch continues to grieve what we never had. Ever since ragging was banned, there have been complaints about losing culture with Hall 13 and draconian rules imposed on the movement of first years. Covid took away orientation and galaxy. It is widely agreed that junior-senior interaction is the mode of transmission. Note ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô Not ‚ÄòInteraction‚Äô. But what even is this culture? It‚Äôs what you make of it. memoria praeteritorum bonorum, it‚Äôs a fallacious argument to make that culture increases with every older batch ad infinitum.

I was so lucky to meet seniors and batchmates and juniors and workers and teachers that I made friends out of and I hope our paths keep intersecting for life. If you let yourself, you can find contentment here. Some of the best moments of maybe life till now have been found in quiet moments across campus. Listening to music and admiring the million shades of green, yellow and blue on a sunny day. The way the reflection of fountain water dances on the roof of the library parking lot. Sunsets seen from the stage, sunrises seen from every rooftop. Every single conversation or cups of coffee shared between us. Darkened lecture halls with the red burning digital clocks. Slanting scribbled handwriting. It is so hard to believe it has been four years. It‚Äôs futile to even attempt to articulate what it has done to me. But I hope you can feel what I‚Äôve felt. This has been a week of watching everyone of my friends leave one by one all tears and promises to meet again. The day I am completing writing this is also the day I am leaving after seven days of goodbyes. It is unsettling to see my life here evaporate to six bags and a gate pass. It reminds me of the last day of a fest when it is five am and you are bewildered to see events ground empty when a breath ago there was no place to walk. The ground is all mildew and it is just your four friends and the fog, you have been talking straight for three hours, two of which were spent suppressing yawns until it all goes dead quiet.",

      "IIT Kanpur first got a particle accelerator in 1968. At that time, it was among one of the first big pieces of equipment, after the IBM computer at IITK campus. The first particle accelerator was a 2 MV Van-de-graff accelerator donated by the US through the Kanpur Indo-American Program (KIAP). In 2006, the original accelerator was dismantled and disposed of since it was no longer suitable for newer projects. The currently installed Tandetron Accelerator was purchased in 2006 from High Voltage Engineering Europa, Netherlands and established in 2008. Professor Vishwas Kulkarni was responsible for setting up the accelerator. Professor Aditya Kelkar has been looking after the facility since 2014. Presently, IIT Kanpur is the only IIT to host a particle accelerator, but some other research institutions like BARC, TIFR, Punjab University and BHU do host accelerators.",
      "Ion Generator",
      "An accelerator produces a high-energy ion beam. The accelerator on campus is aTandem accelerator, which means that it uses the same voltage to accelerate an ion twice. In a tandem accelerator, the main accelerator tube has both its ends grounded, and it is segmented. There are pellets which are separated by insulators. Successive pallets are at higher potentials, with the central pallet at 1.7 MV. As soon as the beam crosses the central pallet, it collides with high-energy gas, which changes its polarity to positive. The central pallet then repels it, accelerating it further. Therefore, using this tandem accelerator, one can obtain beams of energies up to 3.4 MeV. An environment of Sulphur Hexafluoride is maintained to maintain such high voltages because air breaks down at high voltages (di-electric breakdown?). There is a unit to compress SF6 gas that compresses it to 7 bar.",
      "Accelerator Tube",
      "At this point, the beam is no longer focused. An ensemble of magnetic lenses ‚Äì concave-convex-concave is used to focus the beam. (Why are three lenses used? ‚Äì there‚Äôs always some variation in the energy, and a single lens would focus beams with varying energy at different points ‚Äì analogous to chromatic operation in optics). The lenses themselves are electrostatic, and their power supplies can supply up to 20 kV. The focal length of this ensemble of lenses is around 2-3 metres.",
      "Lens Setup",
      "The accelerator is very expensive, and to use it efficiently; multiple beamlines are used. A switching magnet is used to direct the beam towards the desired beamline. The magnetic field bends the beam through a certain angle to direct it.¬† This allows an experiment to take place while preparations for others are underway. The laboratory has two dedicated beamlines, one for microbeam experiments and the other for Rutherford backscattering. Every beamline also has parallel plates that allow for fine-tuning the direction of the beam.",
      "3 millimetre thick tubes are used to ensure that X-ray or other radiation does not leak out. An online Geiger counter keeps track of ambient radiation to provide added safety, and the system shuts down as soon as it exceeds the permissible value. There are similar safeguards when water pressure drops or the vacuum partially fails.",
      "The laboratory gets electricity from the institute, but it has its own 100 kV transformer to isolate the grounding. The laboratory also has a 62 kW UPS that is used to shut down the accelerator safely.",
      "Ions beams require a vacuum to move. In the accelerator, turbomolecular pumps are used to create a vacuum. Fun fact, they work on the same principle as a jet engine! The laboratory has multiple turbomolecular pumps. The life of a pump is ten years, so there is a fair chance that one pump fails every year. This constitutes the bulk of maintenance costs.",
      "Microbeam Setup",
      "The annex was built after the building just to house the microbeam setup. Beam coming from the accelerator is a centimeter in diameter, and the lenses in the microbeam tube are used to focus it down to micrometer size. It is used to create small channels in materials and for scanning.",
      "Funding the atomic particle accelerator is essential for its maintenance and existence altogether. In its embryonic phase, the accelerator got seed money for its first three years from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India. Now it is funded by IIT Kanpur itself. Due to the financial scenario in the status quo, the instrument lacks a root for steady funding. The institute has granted funds even in situations where the accelerator faced unanticipated failures in the technical domain highlighting its support for the instrument. A certain sum of the maintenance cost is financed from the institute‚Äôs research funds.The accelerator was manufactured by a Dutch company called High Voltage Engineering Europa, and many of its components are not manufactured in India. In the past, when one of the components failed, the only option was to ship it back to the Netherlands. It used to be an expensive process.The team administering the accelerator is incorporating indigenous mechanisms for maintenance intending to truncate the dependence on the parent company, and they have been satisfactorily successful in this regard. Professor Kelkar claims that with respect to high-voltage electronics, they are in a position to maintain everything on their own, and hence not a lot of funding is required.",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, which played a crucial role in p-wave scattering, the accelerator has been unable to make significant progress due to several setbacks. Its chief investigator, Professor Kulkarni, passed away in 2010, and the machine malfunctioned shortly after that. It was re-established in 2014 and resumed functioning in 2016. Despite this, the accelerator appears to be rather promising, as several studies yielding significant results are now being conducted on it. In addition, there have been no catastrophic mishaps that have harmed humans or machines. Since its inception, security and safety standards have been in place.",
      "The accelerator‚Äôs accessibility is not limited to the physics department alone. There has been collaboration with the mechanical department, a faculty member from the chemical engineering department, and BSBE.",
      "In addition, external collaboration with Flexible Electronics to determine the composition of conducting ink has occurred.¬† Current collaborations include one with NIT Patna and one with Saha Institute (Calcutta). The lab welcomes additional cooperation.",

      "Early on, at the start of the millennia, Mr Satish Kaura, an alumnus of our institute, was running a business that manufactured most of the cathode ray tubes for displays in the country. However, he had the foresight to realise that the industry would need to be nimble and change and evolve in the coming years. The inception of the Flexible Electronics ecosystem at IIT Kanpur was set in motion with the Samtel Centre for Display Technologies coming up under the guidance and leadership of Prof. K. R. Sarma, Prof. R. Sharan and a team of enthusiastic faculty members from multiple departments from the institute.",
      "While this facilitated and enhanced academia-industry collaboration, there were still challenges faced to translate the research ideas into manufacturing and making the ideations commercially viable. The National Centre for Flexible Electronics (Flex-E Centre), built as a centre of excellence, came about to address this need. The Flex-E Centre is home to the intersection of industrial ideation, manufacturing and entrepreneurial ventures engaging with corporate pioneers and academicians, along with the support of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) of the Government of India and the Institute administration. With more than 20 member industries and NDAs with over 125 organisations, the Flex-E Centre stands tall in the academic area as a place of innovation and science. To cover what goes on at this flagship centre on our campus, correspondents from Vox Populi reached out to Prof. Sundar Kumar Iyer, the current coordinator of the centre and visited the facility to get a glimpse of the day-to-day happenings there.",
      "The Flex-E Centre building is a modern state-of-the-art facility that is home to more than 10 ongoing projects spanning various topics. The core group leading this centre consists of faculty members as mentors, a chief operating officer (COO) and subject expert team leaders. They are ably supported in carrying out the activities by several research, maintenance and office staff.¬† Many of the researchers involved with the centre have international and international experience.¬† Currently, the activities in the facility are funded by MeitY, the strategic sector (eg. Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO and the Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO) and industrial partners. The annual operational costs for the centre add up to an amount of 8 ‚Äì 10 crores.",
      "We then visited the support labs, starting with theWet lab, which is where inks are developed for printing electronics on various flexible substrates, such as plastics, paper, cloth and metal foils. The in-house develops inks, often custom built on request of partner industries and ongoing projects. These inks along with some commercially available ink provide the basic building block of flexible and printed electronic products.",
      "At the other end of the prototype and product development is theSystems Lab.¬† Here the innovative printed components developed are giving a useful practical product form, often in conjunction with traditional electronics and already available articles.¬† In this lab, we got to see some novel applications developed by the centre which address some of the common-place problems faced by the average person in society. The lab has many tools to facilitate its work, including circuit magnifiers, equipment to integrate chips on printed circuit boards, a 3D printer, circuit testing equipment and the like.",
      "The various flexible electronic components developed are often tested and refined in some of the other labs which we viewed from the outside ‚Äì theElectrical Lab,Optics Lab,Materials LabandSensors Lab.",
      "We got a glimpse of some of the products developed at the centre by the different groups.¬† The problems that the products address are practical and often typically Indian in their context.",
      "One such product, which is built upon investigative research carried out earlier at IIT Kanpur, is aboutverifying milk quality(Prof. Siddhartha Panda, Dr¬† Devendra Mourya and team). Milk in India is often procured by cooperatives from multiple households.¬† Contamination from any one source will contaminate the whole collection. This project aims to detect many of the common contaminants quickly, effectively and at a low cost so that contaminated milk may be identified just before it is received.",
      "We got to view some innovative applications in healthcare developed at the centre. Prof. Mazhari, Mr Biswanath Panda and the team have developed a few versions oftemperature monitoring devicesthat were deployed during the pandemic within our institute.¬† Another innovation by this team is detecting the level of liquid in intravenous (IV) fluid bottles used in medical facilities.¬† This innovation can sensitise the nurse electronically or by an alarm, once the level liquid comes close to finishing.¬† The innovative labels used for this prototype were built with in-house ink and printed in the roll-to-roll machine.¬† This product when deployed will greatly aid in giving better treatment to patients and ease the stress on caregivers.",
      "Warm hugis a product developed by multiple teams at the centre. For this product, heaters are printed with in-house developed carbon inks and then integrated into jackets.¬† The heaters are self-limiting at the maximum temperature they can reach and hence are safe for regular use. These jackets are primarily being developed to assist soldiers placed at higher altitudes to stay warm while using minimal electrical power ‚Äì equivalent to the order of which we store in our phone batteries ‚Äì to heat up the jacket. The initial prototypes were tried out by SIS guards at our campus in the Kanpur winters. The ITBP has been in talks with Flex-E Centre to test and assess deployment in higher altitudes.",
      "Another area of innovation isflexible displays and lightingwith organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.¬† Prof. Monica Katiyar, Dr Muralidharan Balasubramanian and the team are exploring a variety of applications, including in the automobile sections.¬† Similarly, Prof. Deepak Gupta, Dr Ashutosh Tripathi and the team are involved in many innovative projects with DRDO and ISRO¬† using thin film transistor (TFT) technology and other devices for deployment in submarines and antennas respectively. Prof. Anshu Gaur is looking into using amorphous metal-oxide and metal-oxynitride semiconductors to build flexible electronic devices.¬† Prof. Iyer‚Äôs team is developingflexible solar modules on paper substrates.",
      "Flex-E Centre has spawned a couple of start-up ventures. One such start-up isCheckofrom Prof. Deepak Gupta‚Äôs team, which prints PUFs (Physically Unclonable Features). The unique ID of the PUF can be verified for authenticity by using a pre-downloaded app on a smartphone.¬† The product is currently used by Madhya Pradesh Beej Nigam and the Delhi Excise Department, besides many private companies that want to ensure their brand protection.",
      "The second start-up is mentored by the ink team led by Prof.¬† Y.N. Mohapatra and Dr Ashish Gupta calledLikhotronics. The pens this start-up has developed have different conductive inks which are supplied with a do-it-yourself (DIY) kit.¬† By drawing lines with these pens on paper, one can build circuits which could be used to help children learn concepts in electronics.¬† This is expected to have an impact on education ‚Äì teaching and examining electrical circuit concepts ‚Äì in the coming years.",
      "The strength of the centre, we were told, is its ability to reach out to the industry and work with them in developing many relevant solutions with it. This process is ably supported by the COO Dr Sudheer Kumar along with the individual faculty members and other team members involved.",
      "The Flex-E Centre is a multidisciplinary centre institute, where research results from various disciplines ‚Äì electronics, materials, chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, bio-engineering, etc. are harnessed for addressing the needs of society. Such a dynamic centre of excellence, with cutting-edge innovation and technological advancements coming out of it, is a matter of immense pride not just for our Institute but for our nation as well. Keep an eye out for novel ideas and technologies from this engineering and science centre!",
      "We genuinely thank Prof. Sundar Kumar Iyer for his great zeal and support in helping us write this article.",

      "Have you ever tried sleeping early, only to be woken up by an army of mosquitoes out for your blood, all while your roommate sleeps peacefully right next to you, with no signs of an insect assault? Is the Mosquito corporation out to get you, or is there something else?",
      "It is no secret that mosquitoes are attracted to certain scents and repelled by others, as shown by multiple studies done on this subject. However, these are scattered and use various parameters, making it hard to reach general conclusions. This also makes it difficult to predict responses to new odours. So, to solve this problem, Prof. Nitin Gupta and his team at IIT Kanpur have compiled the available behavioural and electrophysiological olfactory responses in 12 species of mosquitoes from over 170 research papers and have created a database calledMORE(Mosquito Olfactory Response Ensemble). Now, what is so special about this database? And how was it created?",
      "So How Does One Create a Database on Mosquito Corp?",
      "Well, one problem that the researchers faced was that different studies measured behavioural responses using different metrics. Some of the metrics used were preference index, percent attraction, percent repellency, etc. All of these were instead converted to one common metric ‚Äì the Preference Index:",
      "Not only this, many studies reported data in the form of plots. This data also had to be extracted manually. Moreover, entries that were reported under different synonyms were mapped to a standard name and the odorant concentrations were converted to standard units.",
      "Alright, so a lot of work was put into making this structured database, but the question remains ‚Äì how will it be useful?",
      "It‚Äôs Not You. It‚Äôs Your Roommate.",
      "One interesting pattern that the researchers noticed was that higher concentrations of Benzaldehyde were typically associated with more aversion. This can be seen in graph A1. This naturally led to the question ‚Äì can this behaviour be generalised? Do other odours also show similar patterns?",
      "So, to study the effect of odour concentration on preference index, researchers at IIT Kanpur collected pairs of preference indices at concentrations separated by a factor of 10 for the same odour, using the same type of assay (the process of analysing a substance to determine composition or quality) in the same species and compared the preference indices at higher and lower concentrations. The results of this experiment support what you may have suspected ‚Äì your roommate is probably just more‚Ä¶ odorous. It turns out that increasing the odour concentration 10-folds decreases the preference index (on average) by 0.2. What‚Äôs more, this trend is observed in both positive (attractive) and negative (aversive) odours.",
      "Why? One would ask. Well, one possible explanation for this is that higher concentrations are likely to activate non-specific olfactory responses, irrespective of whether they are positive or negative odours. This indicates a very disturbing result ‚Äì the ones who are the safest from mosquitoes are either those who haven‚Äôt showered in ages or those who leave a traumatising trail of deodorant behind them.",
      "The Perfect Smell",
      "If the behavioural response varies depending on the odour, then there must be a smell that mosquitoes prefer, which can be used to ‚Äòredirect‚Äô them. In that case, how do we find it?",
      "This is where MORE comes in handy! The data from MORE can be visualised in the form of graphs, such as these graphs which check the response of sensory neurons against some common parameters of odorant molecules.",
      "The nice bell curves indicate that mosquitoes preferably detect molecules whose physicochemical properties are within certain ranges. 12 of the 13 properties on which data is available show such curves, the only exception being the number of conformers of the molecule. This indicates that there are in fact ‚Äòideal molecules‚Äô (read smell) that the mosquitoes can detect. All one needs to do now is find such a molecule in the closest pharmacy.",
      "This regularity in the data tells us that it is probably possible to complete the missing points on the graph. And this is where it gets even more interesting. A neural network was built and trained with a 70-15-15 split of the dataset for training, validation and testing. The model showed very promising results, with a high correlation to the testing data, suggesting that machine learning will be a useful tool when predicting the responses to novel odorants.",
      "Here‚Äôs to a mosquito-free sleep?",
      "So, not only does MORE help compare various studies on mosquitoes, but it can also be used to study the effect of various changing parameters on olfactory responses and predict responses to new odours. And then there‚Äôs also the fact that it may help remove your name from Mosquito Corp‚Äôs books.",

      "",
      "Metacognition, in simple words, is thinking about your thoughts. Sounds interesting, doesn‚Äôt it? Prof. Shikha Dixit (Professor in Psychology at IIT Kanpur) and Prof. Sabnam Basu (Assistant Professor in management at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad) worked on a paper to find therole of metacognition in rational decision making. While releasing this paper, Prof. Sabnam was a final year PhD student working under the supervision of Prof. Shikha Dixit. To understand more about their work and the use of metacognition in our daily life, Vox talked to Prof. Sabnam Basu. Read on to find more about her research:",
      "",
      "Higher-order cognition! In layman‚Äôs terms, we call it thinking about thinking; We all make multiple daily decisions, and the process of decision-making involves information processing. However, everyone has a different and individual style of making decisions. Some people are prone to making intuitive decisions, so they might rely more on their feelings when making a decision. Some people might do a lot of research and try to gather a lot of information about the issue at hand, and thus it can be said that they follow a rational style of decision-making. Some people might depend on others, like their friends or parents, to decide; in contrast, some might make an impulsive decision. So what role would metacognition play?",
      "How we control your thought process, monitor it and regulate would help us decide which kind of decision-making style you are taking up. Metacognition again has two components: the regulation component and the knowledge component. The knowledge component is the information one has about their cognitive abilities. The regulation component is about how we monitor our cognitive skills.",
      "",
      "There are two systems of the brain, System I and System II. System I is the fast and intuitive process, while System II is the slow and deliberate one. Usually, when we encounter day-to-day decisions or activities, system I of the brain takes precedence as it requires lesser cognitive effort. Thus multiple decisions every day are made without doing much deliberation. However, whenever we encounter a decision that is of great importance or has a higher difficulty level, it has been found that System II takes over. Thus initial decisions taken via gut feeling might be revisited by going in depth. Similarly, when talking in terms of decision-making style, it has been observed that people do not always have one decision-making style. They could have a primary style and a secondary style.",
      "",
      "My other paper on depression talks about when the number of choices increases, the person might find themselves revisiting the decision after making it. In earlier times, for example, our parents would have two or three college choices. So even if they took a ‚Äòwrong decision‚Äô, they would not blame themselves; they‚Äôd blame the situation. But nowadays, we would blame ourselves if we take an ‚Äòincorrect decision‚Äô as we had a whole lot of choices available and still made an incorrect decision. So, as the paper suggests, the abundance of choices in modern times might be a contributing factor to the prevalence of depression.",
      "",
      "Yes! There was another category of decision-makers I had talked about in the paper, called maximisers. Maximisers try to optimise their decision-making by looking at all available options. For example, if a maximiser looks for a gift for their friend, they would look at all the possible options and then decide, as opposed to someone who would just go and buy the first gift they like and not look at it every opportunity. Studies suggest that these people are more prone to depression and also that their metacognition skills are deficient. Thus metacognition might act as a buffer.",
      "",
      "There are two things here. The first is the decision‚Äôs outcome. On a scale called the Decision Outcome Inventory (DOI), it questions your ‚Äòlife‚Äôs outcomes‚Äô such as receiving a parking ticket or getting into a mild accident. The point is to ask if people have faced these outcomes from bad decisions. Based on this, we decide if the person‚Äôs decision-making style is good or bad.",
      "The second thing we look at is biases. If these increase in one‚Äôs decision-making, that is a wrong decision. An example of a decision-making bias is the availability bias. Some people are still hesitant to go on aeroplanes because they believe them to be unsafe, but if one were to look at the data, air travel is the safest mode of transportation. But this fear still prevails because when an aeroplane accident occurs, it escalates to such a degree that it becomes salient in your mind. At the same time, this doesn‚Äôt happen with regular road accidents‚Äîavailability of information matters.",
      "",
      "",
      "In psychology, we perform the preliminary research and based on that, we prepare a questionnaire. Furthermore, the questionnaire asks multiple questions to assess a single parameter. This way, if one question doesn‚Äôt give a good result, another one would. Sometimes questions are also repetitive. For example, one question might be, ‚ÄúDo you rely on your feelings?‚Äù and another one would be, ‚ÄúDo you rely on your emotions?‚Äù This way, we can check how truthful the person is and whether they are following some random pattern for answering the survey and not actually answering. There are even some questions to check social desirability.",
      "",
      "",
      "The importance of cognition can be felt everywhere today. Even IIT Kanpur has recently established a cognitive science department. This highlights the importance of cognition in today‚Äôs time. Moreover, previously metacognition was mainly studied in the educational psychology domain with implications for student learners. However, it has become necessary to link metacognition and decision-making over the years. Now the importance of metacognition is not only limited to educational psychology but has even spread to organizational behaviour, as the more aware you are of your mental capacity, the fewer biases you‚Äôll face in decision-making.",
      "",
      "",
      "The primary advice for all would be to follow your interest. You have to work with that specific subject for a lot of time. Thus you must have a keen interest in the same. In research, I‚Äôd say that patience is the crucial element for the successful completion of your work. There would be instances where the variable or your statistic data might not seem significant. But don‚Äôt you think insignificant results also speak a lot? They are an essential part of your research. So never get discouraged by insignificant results. There might be times when you would want to give up. But, you have to be patient and think of their entire research journey as learning. Be focused and take small steps towards your ultimate goal. This would help you with your mental health as well as the research.",

      "A team of engineers and research scholars led by Prof. Rohit Budhiraja from the Electrical Engineering department of the Institute has contributed to the design of the first indigenous 5G network. The complete hardware and software of this 5G network was built from scratch, and that too completely inhouse.¬† India‚Äôs first 5G call was recently made using this network by the telecom minister. Vox team talked to Prof. Budhiraja to break down the development and what it means for the country:",
      "The 5G mobile network consists of our phone, the base station (BS), and the core network. A BS further consists of three different sub-systems:¬† baseband unit (BBU), remote radio head (RRH) and the antennas. The BBU is the heart of the 5G network which processes the data which needs to be transmitted by the BS to the user or receive from it.¬† To indigenously build the 5G technology in the country, various institutes worked on different parts of the 5G network. While IIT Bombay developed the core network, IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras took up the responsibility for development of the entire BS hardware and software.",
      "This is the first nationally-endorsed project globally for the 5G initiative. While a few private corporations have been significant players in the market, India as a nation emerges as the first country to indigenously build a 5G network.",
      "All our systems are dependent on telecom networks today. If this network falls into the wrong hands or is controlled by a monopolized market, then critical systems of the entire country lie susceptible. This is one of the reasons why we should have indigenous technology. Such indigenous system design also helps in training the young engineers who want to solve challenging problems. It also helps in reducing the telecom import bill, which is currently the second highest after that of oil. Although a few Indian companies have developed system components, they are isolated components and do not constitute the entire network.",
      "5G and previous telecom generations primarily differ in three broad aspects over a 4G network",
      "The 5G system design complexity, when compared with 4G, due to the aforementioned aspects, has also increased exponentially.",
      "We had to tackle numerous problems in our journey, but I‚Äôll particularly share one incident we had while testing the BBU, which consists of a motherboard, and our custom hardware card. Both of them communicate via a PCI connection that acts as an interface to send data. The correct way is to connect the custom hardware card‚Äôs transmitter with the motherboard‚Äôs receiver. However, due to a small overlook, our team connected the card‚Äôs transmitter to the motherboard‚Äôs transmitter.",
      "",
      "Although it looks like a naive error, it was a significant blunder. The motherboard didn‚Äôt detect the card, and our team went clueless. We had to spend a lot of time understanding which component was going wrong. Without testing the transmitter, we couldn‚Äôt test the card. We realized our mistake after almost three months of rigorous testing.",
      "",
      "Interestingly, a cross helped us verify if the card and the transmitter are working. However, in the entire globe, there was just one vendor for cross-cable. Thankfully we ordered the device before the lockdown and as soon as the cable landed in IIT Kanpur, we could confirm that the card was working properly. Hence, with just a few design changes, we were ready to roll. This helped in reducing the overall system design cost.",
      "",
      "Building a subsystem is challenging, and bringing all of it together is even more complicated. The more complex the problem is, the more satisfaction it gives to make it work. The urge to solve complex problems drove my students to leave their high-paying¬† corporate jobs, come back and work on these projects.",
      "Every decade, there is a generation shift in the telecom industry ‚Äì 3G in 2000, 4G in 2010, and 5G in 2022. So by 2030, we can expect 6G to get materialized.The standards of different generations are designed by standard making bodies. My lab first performs theoretical research on 6G technologies. We do this¬† first by analyzing these technologies using advanced mathematical tools like machine learning, convex optimization, information theory, and linear algebra. We then push these ideas to standards. My team regularly attends standard meetings, which were being held online, and have recently become offline. They will soon start traveling abroad to attend these meetings, and that too every month and a half.",
      "There are a lot of challenging theoretical and practical research problems in the 5G+/6G wireless domain which are waiting to get cracked. We need motivated and hardworking students to work on them. My advice is once you start working on these problems, you need to be patient while solving them. You should not get deterred by the impediments you might face. It is about being patient and tackling them. Students should be willing to make mistakes, learn from them, not repeat the old mistakes, and again willing to make fresh ones. We have had a lot of B.Tech students with such an attitude. They have worked with complete determination with us in their 4th year, and have even got their papers published in one year. All such students are now either doing cutting-edge research in their PhD or working in top-notch wireless research companies.",
      "During my masters, the inclination toward research was relatively low. Wireless companies could not find students who had experience working in wireless networks, as students did not opt for research. The change in attitude came in the last 20 years, when the government focused on promoting IITs as research institutes. Now, there is a transition in IITs from undergraduate teaching institutes to research institutes.",
      "",
      "This change is visible in also the teachings imparted as we offer state-of-the-art courses which are relevant for both theoretical and standards-based research. The undergraduate and postgraduate students can now equip themselves with the relevant skill-set¬† by first doing relevant courses, and then performing the cutting-edge research, which will help them in building a promising career.",

      "At the end of January, a company came for an internship. They called everyone in formals who applied for that, and I was also there. From 10 am to evening, they were calling people alternatively, but they didn‚Äôt call me. I waited till 5 pm. It was pretty demeaning and shouldn‚Äôt happen in placements.

      "Pushpesh Kumar is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Civil Engineering. In this edition of As We Leave 2022, he talks about his IITK journey. He shares the memories he made and some crazy incidents he had during his stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Ummm‚Ä¶okay so I came to IITK in Civil Engg. dept., and I think it will be easy to guess the general mindset of around 70% of students at my stage? 1st yr. ke end tk branch change maarenge and fir maze hai. But I was in the other 30%. I saw CE as a very resourceful branch if we see the opportunities available. For me, CE is an evergreen department. Although I did tell my parents I will study for a branch change, I was not in a mood though :P.",
      "It all began with most of the students getting a double sharing room but me getting a triple sharing room on the top floor of a six-story building, Hall 13. Yeah, it was a bummer in the start but thanks to my roomies, who made the transition easier by providing sufficient space for me to keep my stuff XD. After planting the family tree and ‚Äúcovering the gaps‚Äù during orientation, I was well settled.",
      "Everyone has their own wing story and it is fun in their own way. Mine is kinda hazy for me as I think I did not give the time one should give to the wingmates. Nevertheless, it was them on whom I counted day and night throughout my first sem and the rest of the semesters for any academic help I needed. I am so grateful that even in my 8th semester, I had them as my wingies. My IITK wale bhailog helped me pass the first-year courses while I was busy dancing throughout the nights.",
      "Talking about dance, I always wanted to explore the dancer in me, hence having a precious space for dancing in my heart. Right then, came the Freshers as an icebreaker. I gave my 1st on-stage performance & who knew, this was the beginning of a journey to become one of the main dancers of IITK. Coincidentally, for the first time ever, the first-yearites were being selected for the dance team and I made it through!. It was an extreme pleasure to be a part of KOS, IITK, right at the start of college. I was damn excited for all the upcoming lifetime experiences of Rendezvous, Antaragni, Galaxy, and Inter-IIT ofc. Though dance is very time taking, it is worth giving time to.",
      "The first semester ended in a blink and a new semester began. Suddenly, everyone started behaving as if we were going for a world cup. It was not a world cup but something more than that (as I belong to Hall-3), it was Galaxy. Most of my second semester was spent in hall 3. Learning new dance styles, and moves, practicing a lot to devote every drop of sweat to my hall. As many of the first years do, and the seniors kinda pull you to do so (if you talk to your seniors sincerely, they do help manage too), I lost focus in academics and ended up securing the worst SPI of my 4 years ‚Äì 6.71. It‚Äôs a very common mistake a fresher makes in their second semester. Honestly, I don‚Äôt really regret it now, only because of the other unimaginable and absolutely worth it experience that I lived. I started becoming confident on stage, in front of a crowd, and then, the most special event happened ‚Äì I was the lead actress in the dance drama event of that year ‚Äì Priyanka Chopra XD.",
      "In my opinion, 1st yr. is usually the most fun because after that, one starts thinking about academics, how to manage things you f**ked up last year, and how to take a big POR (the efforts for it starts from the 2nd yr. itself). In short, how to align yourself in a good position for the next 3 years. With the same thought, I participated in the Summer of Code and also did a project under the E-club during the summers.",
      "Moreover, a realization hits you ‚Äì Yaar! I need to improve my CPI! But how? It‚Äôs Antaragni time and I have the max number of songs to perform on & that requires a hell lot of time. Well, luckily my third semester was not so tough and I focussed on getting ‚ÄòB‚Äôs in all the courses and an ‚ÄòA‚Äô in HSS. Got 8.7. This marked the highest of my college life XD. Not talking about acads much, I got a chance to dance a lot, performing in almost all the songs and representing IITK at Antaragni, moreover being the first runners-up, was an overwhelming feeling both personally as well as for the whole team.",
      "Mind you, an even bigger target was awaiting! To win the Inter-IIT in the home ground of IIT Bombay (Madrid to our Barca). The team was confident with the production we had ‚Äì and we made it, ‚ÄúOverall dance champions ‚Äì IITK‚Äù. Even after multiple tricks to keep us down, the team rose as champions. Indeed, one of the most thrilling experiences of my college life. The environment, feel, competition, people, everything was at its peak at IIT Bombay, and we emerged as Champions! A big thanks to the seniors who made this possible.",
      "For me, 4th semester was the busiest. . If I just list out the events that happened in 2 months on campus ‚Äì galaxy (I was leading this time), Counselling Service (CS) core team interviews (5 rounds), my laptop got stolen, I became the CTM and thus conducting SG interviews, and finally Covid. Sounds tough? Yes, it was!",
      "Leading the hall dance team in Galaxy 2020 (being Preity Zinta in the dance drama XD) was thrilling, but before going for dance coordinator, I decided to apply for the position of a core team member at CS. It gets unnoticed by most people, but the work done inside CS is really helpful for those who really need it. 5 rounds of interviews along with continuous night-outs for dance practice. It was hectic.",
      "But something else was yet to come. It was around 9:30 PM when I returned after finishing round 3 of the CTM interviews just to find that my laptop had been stolen. SIS guards were there. I was stunned. After 2-3 days of roaming around with local police and performing in the dance battle without any sleep, the solution was to file an FIR. To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the very next day, the thief was caught stealing a cycle at the Open Air Theatre, with my friend‚Äôs stolen phone in his pocket. FIR was filed before, so it was now a legal affair to get the laptop, that had to be done via a court procedure. My two victim friends and I had some trips to the court for the processes and paperwork. But then the worst thing happened, COVID. Our one-week holiday became 1.5 years of stay at home. On the brighter side, I became one of the CTMs-Operations team, my academics were not harmed too much as adequate grades were given by the professors due to Covid, and and and, after 3-4 trips to Kanpur high court during that lockdown period, I got my laptop back exactly after one year of it being stolen. Wohooooooooo!!!",
      "It won‚Äôt be right if the part where I failed and was really broken is left unspoken. After all the drama in the fourth semester, it was the time I prepared for the internship drive with all my heart but faced a lot of rejections. I am sure, during the lockdown, trapped in our homes, each one of us would have faced problems that were mentally challenging. Nothing different was my case. The rejections further added on to it. There‚Äôs already a blog published by the Academic and Career Council about my adventurous internship drive. You can read it ‚Äì hope it will help if you are going for internships.",
      "Link:The More You Know ‚Äì Pushpesh Kumar",
      "In between all this, the online semesters helped me interact with my department buddies ‚Äì due to obvious reasons XD. Becoming the DUGC student nominee enabled me to explore the unexplored aspects of the department. It‚Äôs satisfying that apart from clubs, societies, festival teams, etc., I got this opportunity to bond with my department friends as well.",
      "Here, I would like to give a special mention to the Counselling Service. It‚Äôs one such body that performs a lot of welfare work for the community without being in the light too much. It was a privilege to experience some and be a contributing part of it. After my episode as an SG, it was certain to apply for the Core Team Member. I got into CS while being a member of the Dance team. It‚Äôs a rare combination, and for the same reason, many of my friends were like ‚Äì Bhai kya dekh ke liya tujhe CS walon ne XD. But then, I made sure to do justice to both of these responsibilities. With time, things smoothened and I got a new pool of friends who faced similar cases being in the Operations team. Thereafter, we all organized a successful Orientation (2021) together. Being in CS, the importance of mental health and how people were affected during lockdown was an eye-opener for me. I dealt with some cases with the help of my coordinators and the counselors. This was my major involvement during the third year or we can say ‚Äì during the lockdown.",
      "Among the chaos of Covid, it is worth mentioning that a trip to Dehradun ‚Äì Masoori ‚Äì Dhanaulti ‚Äì Kanatal with the D-club guys was rejuvenating.",
      "Okay, so what did I do in my last year? I worked hard and was fortunate enough to receive a PPO from the MTX group after my internship. So the only thing left was helping my friends during their placement drive and having loads of fun. The placement pressure faced by the candidates is clearly distinguishable and I felt lucky with the PPO in my hand. After all my friends were placed, it was time to party. A trip to Corbett and Rishikesh with my CS mates and then the awaited Goa trip with my D-club friends!!! Trust me when I say, it was the BEST December of my life.",
      "Last semester was just about emotions attached to campus life. The goal was to create as many memories as I can. I‚Äôm utterly convinced you will never get to party in an SIS secured area again with such freedom XD. Hall 1 has its own feel and legacy. Every student in their last semester wants to do everything they think they won‚Äôt be doing in the future. And this is it. Party all day and party all night. No burden at all, just ensuring to pass all the courses. I explored terraces in the Academic area I had never gone to before ‚Äì IME rooftop is the best. Piece of advice ‚Äì go on walks with different groups of people, even if you know them a little or just by face, go and hang out with them once. You may get to meet some of your social media friends in person. This may also help you know people who have the same job location as yours. Try out any of your hobbies you didn‚Äôt get time to explore. I think no one will get these beautiful four years again. You might have seen posts from our alumni with a caption like ‚Äú25 years after I graduated from IITK, still, those were the best 4 years of my life‚Äù. This says it all.",
      "Undoubtedly, college days are going to fill your life with colorful lessons.It‚Äôs that phase of your life, where you can literally do whatever you want. No one‚Äôs going to check if you got a 5 SPI because you were trying out new hobbies during the second year. But, I always say this to every junior, be responsible for the decisions you take ‚Äì‚Äúwith freedom comes responsibility‚Äù. As long as you‚Äôre genuinely answerable for your actions, you‚Äôll do well. It‚Äôs all about being independent and strong enough to deal with various situations. Also, the decision on what to do post-graduation has been, and always will be, an obvious tussle of thoughts. If you‚Äôre bothered about it, you‚Äôre already on the right track mate!. Just enjoy the process, and ultimately you will find your way. College life is like a ship voyage. Being nostalgic about it is just the tip of the iceberg. The real emotions kick in when you roll back the memories you had, and find yourself sinking in the tears of love, care, and above all, friendship! So, build your network and keep rocking‚Ä¶",

      "I remember the first day I came from Kanpur central railway station to IITK, watching Kanpur city slums. I didn‚Äôt particularly like the city, but as soon as I crossed the gates of IITK, it was a different world. I instantly liked the vibe of it. I loved all the greens, with peacocks cooing, a whole new world for me.",

      "I am a person who tries to be very clear about the direction of my life every instant of time. So, when I came here, I knew I wanted to do Track & Field. Being a sportsperson has been a dream of mine for a long time. I didn‚Äôt have time to pursue it in the past as my parents wanted me to get a secure future job, anywhere, not be unemployed. So, that thing was taken care of already, and this was my time to pursue it more rigorously. I already knew there was a good sports culture here (unlike others, I had my research done :P). So, learning about the inter-IIT sports meet, I had my goals set already, and I was onto it from the first day.",
      "",
      "Performing in Inter IIT sports meets at an exceptional level is no joke. We are talking about being the best player considering all IITs in the country. It becomes more hectic because of all our commitments in the institute, not to mention all the practice that goes into it. Being exceptional at something requires an outstanding work ethic. It is a fact, believe it or not. Doing exceptional work for something leaves little to no time for other things. So, that‚Äôs why they say you can be average in many things, but you can be exceptional in just one or two things at a given time. Academics was always on my priority list because I wanted a job at the end of four years and sports was what I loved, so it became Academics and Athletics for me. I made the inter-IIT team in the first year. I saw that meeting to check the competition level because I knew there had not been enough time for me to prepare for medal performances. I did not get any individual medals, as expected. Still, it ended with a silver medal, with our relay team missing out on gold. I was OK with that. But inside me, I knew next year should be it. So, the first semester ended with the inter-IIT, and I had performed well in acads, too, so the year ended well.",
      "Experiencing the sports meet in my first year made me more focused, driving me towards Athletics, practising more and more. I tried to fit in more practice sessions whenever I got the chance. I was practising more than ever, and guess what, practising more requires you to rest more, taking more of your time, which led to my acads taking a hit. I could not do well in my studies. The second sem was the one with the least SPI for me. But at least I performed well at sports. It was a plus point :P. But anyway, I needed to readjust next semester.",
      "",
      "Summer camp came up, and I Completed it. I knew my performance would shoot up, and it did! I was happy. In the third semester, I needed to readjust myself so that my acads wouldn‚Äôt suffer. For me, readjustment was all about ‚Äúshowing up everyday‚Äù. Just show up everyday for the grind. No matter how little you do, how you feel, or what is going on emotionally with you, show up and do what you can. People these days are playing themselves short. They are afraid to push their limits.",
      "‚ÄúOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frighten us. We ask ourselves, ‚ÄòWho am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?‚Äô Actually, who are you not to be?‚Äù",

      "Winter camp was going on, which happens in the first two weeks of December, just before the inter IIT happens. And, as we all know, everything doesn‚Äôt go as we plan. I got a boil in my right ankle just10 days before the meet. I couldn‚Äôt wear my slippers, let only the shoes. Practice sessions became out of the question. But, I was not only worried about that. I knew that I had practised all year, done what had to be done, so that should be it. It should not matter that much. We went to the doctor and took the medication. It took two weeks to heal fully. And right then was the meet.",

As I went through race after race, I knew I was not in shape needed to get medals. It was heart-shattering. It was time for me to make a choice. Either I could give up or churn the cream into butter.",

I was going race after race, pushing myself as hard as possible, not giving up. Participating in the races two times a day for six days in itself served as a medium for my body to catch up and get into shape. So, the last day was the 400th relay. I was feeling quite well and performed quite great according to my capabilities at that time, and that, added with an exceptional final leg by Ajay (47.95s _/\\_), we got the Gold medal! (snatching the inter IIT record, too!). I was overjoyed at that moment. The last six days had been quite a toll on me, losing races when you aimed to win. Now, I could finally let go of all the frustration I had.",
      "It was Ajay‚Äôs final year of college; he had just had his last race at the inter-IIT sports meet, and he felt it. I then thought that at some point in the coming years, I would also be having my last race, just like him, so better make these years count. Little did I know then, it was my last race too.",
      "The first thing I did after that meeting was to take a rest (partly because of the frustration). I haven‚Äôt done it in a long time. I took a week‚Äôs break, returned to campus, and returned to business. Having more experience and more learnings aided in practice sessions. Then comes the day of 15th February 2020. I clearly remember this day. I was doing some workout on hurdles; we had their heights increased that day, and the workout was to jump over them. I did the workout, went to my room, and slept. The next day, I couldn‚Äôt get up straight. There was this extreme pain behind my right knee. Walking was difficult, let alone running. I tried to take some rest and played volleyball behind the back, which added to the injury.",

      "The condition was terrible, and Udghosh‚Äô20 was fast approaching. I was not ready for the competition, but another story twist came (Covid‚Äô19). Udghosh‚Äô20 cancelled. We were sent home and locked down. So, I‚Äôm at home, trying to rehab my injury, balancing academics on the other side and having no idea of what will happen in the future. So, the remaining 4th semester and summers prepared for internship season, different ways to rehab, maintaining my fitness for inter-IIT, and trying not to be infected with the coronavirus. As for my Athletics at the Inter IIT sports meet, I kept trying to maintain my fitness for the inter-IIT sports meet for two years, but it never happened.",
      "Next semester comes up with the internship season. I prepared well for the season. I was confident that I‚Äôd get the internship. But when the season began, it turned out that I was getting shortlisted but never got an offer in the whole semester. I took an online course to prepare my profile side by side as the season continued. The entire semester went away, and I wasn‚Äôt selected, having zero idea why. But I knew I‚Äôd get the internship next semester off-campus (I was well prepared until the end of that semester) So, yeah, the 6th semester comes, which gives an unexpected twist to the story.",

      "My interests have been very singular in the past. I usually choose to do one or two things and excel in them. But this time, I had to adapt to new things. It started with a bang of General Elections 2021, where Anshika decided to contest for elections, and I, her teammate, had to go all in with that. So, here I am, having no internship working in elections, leaving my studies aside. It was a foggy path, but I wanted to do it that way. Involving in elections demands every bit of patience and effort from the individuals. Keeping one step in front of the other does the trick in fog. It was a big step outside my comfort zone, and I was a different person coming out of that experience. This experience taught me the importance of getting outside your comfort zone. Fortunately, we won, and I instantly returned to searching for my internship (even before the result :P).",
      "",
      "I went to LinkedIn, applied for off-campus, and searched a lot. So, one day, I was searching for internships as usual, and a call came from SPO asking if you were free and Oracle wanted to give me an internship. I was utterly shocked. Apparently, I was on their waiting list from the interview they took during the SPO season, and now the seat was empty. It was something else for me. A boy searching for off-campus free internships suddenly gets an intern at Oracle. But some people reacted differently. They thought it was a fluke. He had luck, that‚Äôs it. And it ate at me.",
      "So, the semester ends well, and the internship starts. My aim going into it was to get a PPO. That‚Äôs it. So, I worked extra hard those two months. Those two months were something else. I was also the team captain at that point, and we decided to start online workout groups, where senior people gave workouts daily to keep people engaged. Those workout groups went on for six more months. Also, I was overweight until that time, as I was not able to not run due to my injury, to which doctors said everything was alright. I was working out two times, working as an intern for up to 10 hours a day (Our team pushed extra hard, that‚Äôs not how internships need to be) and giving workouts daily to the team. It went on this way until the internship ended. It included many ups, downs, happy, sad moments, everything. But we completed the project in time, and it was over. And there comes a call from my manager (which I missed at first :P) that they are offering me a pre-placement offer at Oracle, which I accepted. I remember this day clearly as I had my vaccine too. I was lying on my bed and thinking: This is it, I got a good job to start my career. My parents were overjoyed, and I felt somewhat relaxed.",
      "",
      "Seventh semester was all about helping out my friends to get placed well. We all pushed each other together, and finally, they got good offers. SPI was not a problem anymore. I went on to trip with my friends in December, which was quite fun.",
      "During the final semester, we all were called on campus. It was all about just savouring our final moments on campus, exploring more about ourselves, and enjoying every fest more, which I could not do previously. And gradually, this semester too, came to an end. Here we were, preparing to leave campus, packing our stuff. I wanted to stay on campus as long as possible, so I was among the last ones to leave. Being the last one also has disadvantages; watching your friends go one by one was difficult to carry around.",
      "",
      "It was my day to leave, packed all my stuff, called the auto, just waiting for the auto to come and take me far away from this life. Some friends were present there to bid me off. It came. I took the last selfie with them, trying to smile as hard as I could, shook hands, went inside the auto and waved my hand until I could not see them, leaving behind all the ups, downs, memories, fears, assignments, deadlines, achievements, losses, regrets and some incomplete tales.",
      "One piece of advice for my juniors:You would be very confused at this stage of your life, which is quite normal. Confusion pushes a lot of people into a state of indecisiveness. I would advise you not to stay in that state for long. Decide something and start working on it. You will get your answers on the way. You don‚Äôt wait until all traffic lights turn green.",

      "Sankalp Sharma is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Chemical Engineering.¬†In this edition of As We Leave 2022, he reminisces his time at IITK. He talks about his diverse experiences, the bonds he created and the memories he takes with him.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "",
      "Hello everyone!",
      "‚ÄúAmi Sankalp Sharma. Ami bangla jani na, tobe shikhte chai!‚Äù",
      "That‚Äôs my motto in life: I keep learning something or the other. Learning comes from exploring. I want to encourage everyone to keep exploring something or the other rather than settling down with the convenient, easier way out ‚Äì something that I have profoundly believed in throughout this journey and even in life otherwise.",
      "",
      "In this challenging attempt to pen down my four years at IITK in limited lines, it feels surreal to think of how this journey turned out. Everything that I have with me in the end, finally, is much more than I could ever ask for. I want to share my journey in 5 facets ‚Äì Padhai (academics), Placements, Music, Galaxy, and ‚ÄòFamily‚Äô- the five most important facets of this journey, if you may. I would like to keep my piece informal and just how I would talk about my journey if the reader were right next to me. Every journey involves highs and lows, and mine was no different. But the specific trails and exclusive milestones make every journey and struggle unique, with ample instances to gain meaningful lessons. Hence, sharing my journey here, rather than giving out words of wisdom based on my limited experience, makes the most sense to me. So let‚Äôs begin, shall we?",
      "Like many others, I had this persisting regret that I could have had a much better shot at JEE advanced and secured a higher branch at IIT Kanpur if, for once, things had worked out differently for me and life was easy on me. Hence I started my journey at IITK aiming for a 10-pointer (cliched, I know). The day after orientation, I ended up in the library with ‚ÄòGriffiths‚Äô, given how fond I was of Physics since JEE prep times, so it was really fun to start with. The intent and efforts worked well as I stayed above average + Std. deviation in all courses in the first mid-semester examinations. A momentary delight soon followed by a tragic downfall- an aftermath of the overconfidence and the lack of practice that the early ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô brought along. I missed the A grade by a mark in both Phy103 and Mth 101. The dejected me joked to myself ‚Äì ‚ÄòIf only the Prof could be convinced by a mail to take away even 30 marks from my Phy 103 endsem paper and increase one mark in Mth101 ‚Äì at least one A would show up on my grade sheet, but alas!‚Äô.",
      "",
      "While I got more and more involved in the Music Club (discussed later), I lost practice, especially in ESC101, which starts to get tough after recursion ‚Äì hence leading to another B. Finally, there I was, aiming for the sky, stuck in a date palm tree (aasman se tapka, khajoor pe latka :'(), with an SPI of 8.56. I rushed into calculating how much would I have to score next sem for changing my branch to Economics. However, I soon realised it was hardly feasible and decided to go with the flow and see how things unfold. What further added to the blues was that my roomie (Yashkrit) had managed to score the same SPI while playing PUBG all day long- all hard work for nothing? I thought, ‚ÄúIsse accha hota ki maze hi karliya hote, itni hi SPI aani thi to :'(‚Äú.",
      "",
      "Hence the realisation surfaced that from then, I would do everything else seriously, but studying ‚Äì this stuck along for the following three semesters. Thankfully the practice from previous years had equipped me to understand concepts, even at the last minute. Hence, I managed to get a 6+ SPI, fearing F grades but still being at the average mark in all courses by the end. But by the end of the 2nd year, when I was a 7-pointer and the internship season was approaching, I realised that I had taken acads too lightly. If not amended now, I would have to pay for it later. Hence, I diligently worked hard in the 5th semester, which was online, and even if recorded lectures could be replayed and were convenient, the alarming shift to unfair means was compelling and rather helpless aftermath. I made proper notes and studied regularly in this phase, much like the JEE prep times. Yet thanks to the downsides of the system that only raised the average through conveniently available online resources (cheating, I mean), I still ended up with an SPI of 8. Fast forward to the next semester, which caught me in the ongoing trap of conveniently scoring without caring much about actually learning something. I ended up with an SPI of 9.8 with minimal effort ( it was my tenure as a Coordinator of the Music Club, and I preferred to see the fruitful results of hard work in there at least, if not in acads that was largely a rat race now). This strategy saved the 7th semester too, and I managed to focus on placements as the topmost priority. A word of advice, if I may at this point, would be that don‚Äôt get caught up in the whirlpool of the grading system- you get a C even when you work extremely hard and an A even when you barely read anything.",
      "",
      "Following the plan, I thought the last semester would be amazing. I could conveniently focus on conducting the Musical Extravaganza offline after two years- what I was deprived of in an online semester, and make many memories, that I longed for. But the online to offline transition became hard to crack, and the course policies were atrocious. While in one course, all online evaluations were rendered null and void, in another course, a vast majority was awarded 0 in midsem, and passing criteria was 30% ‚Äì an almost impossible target for a seemingly incomprehensible course. Hence, the last semester was somewhat strained against expectations. Yet, it was decent enough in terms of all the memories we made and adventures we had while I managed to pass all courses, much to my respite and surprise.",
      "",
      "Thus to summarise this facet, it‚Äôs been an absolute rollercoaster. My only suggestion will be to remain consistent with your courses if you want to maintain a good academic record. A spikey academic growth curve like mine creates a lot of pressure and makes one easily accountable in the future. Thus, consistency and diligence remain the key and the most important values I take away from this facet of the journey.",
      "A 7 pointer and insufficient academic highlights on my resume couldn‚Äôt fetch me an SPO internship. Still, support from two of my closest friends helped me immensely (Yashkrit and Shreyasi). I got an exciting research project in SURGE‚Äô21, which had just the right combination of software development application and introduction to machine learning. It proved very beneficial for my placement preparation and was instrumental in making my resume stand out. It also re-established that when you enjoy what you do, the results reflect the fascination and the honest intent. For the first time, I was highly consistent, focused, and determined to make it work, even if I had to learn everything from scratch and decipher the solution on my own. I was very happy academically for the first time when the final presentation amazed my mentor, who excitedly suggested that we go ahead with publication. It was possibly the first time my efforts were appreciated and acknowledged. It felt like my hard work paid off! However, the placement phase also had to be prioritised without a doubt. Hence, the aim of a publication had to take a backseat. But the motivation that Salil Sir‚Äôs words instilled in me reflected undeterred confidence during my placement interviews and possibly worked as the highlight for my profile, as almost every interviewer seemed impressed and gave a nod of approval.",
      "",
      "The entire seventh semester, I made my placement preparation my sole focus. Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt that easy as the semester started at home and later transitioned to campus, still online. There were countless things that I had to balance at the same time. Thankfully, this time, the consistency stuck with me since SURGE. It helped me as I diligently followed every resourceful advice and did everything that seemed to help the preparation in any possible way. But unfortunately, being a 7-pointer cut me off the shortlists for many companies, despite my decent test scores.",
      "",
      "I had one shortlist of my interest for Standard Chartered, a day 3 company and had nothing of my interest for the first two days of placement. However, I was informed that skipping interviews was not an option. Hence, I had to appear for the interviews for the consulting profiles I was shortlisted for. I had just ten days to prepare from scratch ‚Äì obviously insufficient. But given the need for a job, I tried all I could. For the first company, I was almost rejected in the buddy session itself. I was dejected when I realised that the company had no intention to interview me, and yet they found it just fine not to inform me of anything while I stayed up all night hoping to be called in anytime. Day 1 ended in sheer disappointment and with stress brimming. Day 2 for me started at 4 am. At this point, it will be unfair to not mention how helpful and encouraging my IITK family (to be discussed soon) was. From ensuring that I woke up to having my meals, to managing to look humanly decent, to staying sane and hydrated through the interviews.",
      "My wingmate, friend, and brother for life, Yashkrit, was setting up interviews by contacting the POCs. There still was some hope there, as I could be on the extended shortlists for some companies. The day started with three back-to-back rounds for American express, where I performed decently well. However, I was helplessly honest and mere wingies toh apna sir phhod rahe the yeh sochke ki itna hi honest raha toh kya hoga iska!! Pretence never worked for me. I remember how even in the first round for Amazon, I almost gave away that the question was too easy for me as I had solved it multiple times and could have 3-4 solutions. A confused one acing it on the spot would be the mailing impression, but there I was, being myself, and being all naive about it xD.",
      "",
      "Finally, day 2 ended with two offers, and I was determined to make a well-informed decision. Thanks to all seniors and my close ones who helped me navigate this, I finally chose Amazon. The happiness that I could see in my mother‚Äôs eyes gave me the most priceless moment of my life that day and made me realise there‚Äôs still a long way to go. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the humble beginnings!",
      "",
      "It all started with watching others perform (mostly sing) during orientation sessions and wondering if instrumentalists (not just guitarists :p) could have an audience too. A power-packed performance by the Music Club inspired me to aim to perform on that stage someday. Finally, I could see a full band with synth players, besides other instrumentals, and an enchanted crowd overjoyed and singing along, from Hey Jude to Rock On! When I auditioned for the Freshers, I was intimidated by the diversity and the talent around me. The only western music I could play back then (at least I thought so) was Despacito, and I was pretty tense about being rejected. However, I was selected.",
      "Honestly, this was the place that contributed majorly to any positive transformation I have undergone in these four years. I learned so much about life beyond just music and performance. Seeing the conduct of events and the euphoria of being involved and leading the Club (at least it seemed euphoric back then) inspired me to aim toward becoming a Coordinator someday. However, that required being open-minded to ideas and multitasking. I was also involved in Photography, Aquatics, and Electronics Club, intending to attend all three Inter IIT meets at least once (sports, SnT and Cultural Meet). I thought I would get selected for the aquatics team by the end of the second year if I stayed diligent and could manage to get into the teams for the other two Meets. However, it didn‚Äôt work out as I desired. Due to academic obligations and the intent to give my best to whatever I did, I had to prioritise music. I still pursued photography and got highly fascinated by light painting. Capturing some of the shots has been beyond enriching in terms of the learning experience. I could also showcase my shots in Antaragni ‚Äô19 and ‚Äô21 and led both the Photography and Music teams for Galaxy (more on that soon).",
      "It could have easily become overwhelming to multitask with so many interests and not be able to give up on any one of them. However, I feel that exploring each of these interests not only diversified my horizons but also, little by little, contributed to building a resume with a broad scope, reflecting the person I am: avidly interested in culture!",
      "Unfortunately, my tenure as a Coordinator (2020-21) was online. Despite having aspirations to conduct the flagship events more inclusively, and lead the Inter IIT teams to victory (sadly, that couldn‚Äôt happen in the previous years due to lesser preparation times and divided teams ‚Äì something I wished to work on in my tenure), and improve online presence in new, innovative ways, the online term needed a lot more brainstorming and coordination than I had imagined. It was undoubtedly very demanding as communication was strained online. Still, I am so thankful for the team that I had. We did manage to introduce many innovative and inclusive initiatives that targeted not just the UG population but also reached out to the PG members of the student community. The Campus melodies, Instagram presence, webinars with eminent artists, national recognitions, and finally, the successful alumni meet from 1973-2011 batches indeed were major milestones that I could never achieve without the undeterred support and equally motivated vision of my fellow Coordinators (Shreyasi, Prayas, and Adarsh). I am still happy to have gotten a chance to perform offline one last time before graduating, but that came with its own share of an exhausting roller coaster ride. Yet the lessons I have learnt from the Club, the memories I made, the jamming sessions with Raju, Ishan, Vinoba, Aniruddh, and Adarsh, composing our own OC for Inter IIT and acing it on stage (Aniruddh‚Äôs growls will remain irreplaceable) and making some of the most beautiful bonds that will hopefully grow only stronger with time, make the Music Club the most worthwhile place for me on campus and the closest to my heart, in all these years, that I‚Äôll keep yearning to come back to‚Ä¶",
      "The first Galaxy GBM was instrumental in igniting the hall feeling and motivating us to give our absolute best in leading the hall to victory. I participated in events for three different Club categories. That semester, I was already academically discouraged, so I spent all my time either in galaxy events preparation or in the Music Club. The dejection came when despite trying really hard, we couldn‚Äôt win. It ignited a fire: we had to make it to the top the next time, no matter how impossible that seemed. Nobody seemed to believe there was even the slightest possibility of us winning Galaxy the next time, especially in music, considering the tough setlist we chose to cover and the manpower we had to pull off the parts. We had enthusiastic people leading all other events, and it was on my shoulders to lead the Photography and Music teams to the best level of performance. I remember roaming around all day long, going places, with no sensation of thirst or hunger at times, but just the intent to put the best foot forward. From convincing inexperienced people to pick up challenging parts demanding fundamental skills to taking up challenging songs in the setlist and ensuring every bit to keep practising for progress till the last minute, I did all I could. I am so grateful to have had people around who never let me stop and only supported me beyond words. Without these people, giving up or falling short would have been easy.",
      "",
      "I remember how hard we worked for ‚ÄòMandirwa‚Äô (thanks to Shreyasi, who relentlessly helped us with the practices, for the love of Indian Music, and faced inconsiderate criticism all along the way for helping a rival Hall, without whom we would‚Äôve possibly lost to Hall 12). When we were finally declared the Band competition winners, I couldn‚Äôt have been happier for each of us, who worked day in and day out to make that possible, despite the flickering hopes.",
      "",
      "Galaxy 2019 was an emotion and a faith in each other and in the purpose of making things happen! Later, when the results were rendered null and void following several conflicts, we might have still fallen short of the pinnacle. Yet, I am more than proud that Hall 5 did a phenomenal job in all events and deserved the victory we made happen! This shall undoubtedly forever remain one of the major highlights of my journey.",
      "The IITK family tradition worked out very well for me, as it gave me not only the best wing-mates that I could ask for but rather a group of brothers and genuine friends for life- Pal (Adarsh), Wasif, Avinash, Yashkrit, Master, Khush(deep), Divyanshu, Nim(Arunim), PD (Prasanta), Yatish, Divij and Rudram. From being each other‚Äôs undeterred support through the toughest times to celebrating like crazy when any of us got placed, to the deep conversations on issues and matters of relevance that only made me a more open-minded and empathetic person over time- they‚Äôve all been there for me through everything.",
      "This group further extends to others outside the wing, who were there just as much and with whom I hold so many moments very close to my heart- KTK (Kartikeya), Himanshu, Shobhit, Prakhar (the coolest and nicest branch mate who made CHE bearable :p), the Hall-5 HEC team, and those who gave their everything to lead the hall to victory in Galaxy ‚Äô19 and ‚Äô20.",
      "Besides this, my family here also indispensably extends to my homies from the Music Club, with whom I shared countless moments of euphoria, frustration, disappointment, pride, hope, warmth, and so many more. Adarsh, Prayas, Shreyasi, Ishan, Raju, Vaidic, Kothary (Rishabh), Gaurang, Jaya, Shivi, Ananya, Jaskaran, Divya, and others from the Y18 as well as other batches, with whom I cherish every single performance, right from our Freshers to Y19 orientation, to all the flagship events, Inter IIT preparations, and OC composition, to my tenure as a Coordinator and to the final days of unexpected roller coasters (iykwim). In these four years, I think most of us have observed, acknowledged, and been inspired by each other‚Äôs immense growth, musically and even in life. Adarsh‚Äôs growth, for instance, personally motivates me. From playing just the Tabla to learning to play the bass to finally acing it on the drums, he‚Äôs done it all despite many challenges. Believe me, my homies will remain the best people I could find to jam with and learn from. The pandemic was honestly a lot more bearable because of Raju and his jamming/production endeavours and his childlike excitement, and also the happiness I derived out of being engaged in Club activities and managing the tenure in an unexpectedly innovative way, thanks to Shreyasi‚Äôs zeal and passion that so well complemented mine (despite endless bickering to ensure we did the best thing we could :p), Prayas being so patient and focussed throughout the tenure, and Adarsh being Adarsh (damn cool and dashing!). This family also includes the seniors over the years (Bose, Vidwat, Vidushi, Kshitij, Basu, Abhinav, Pragya, Mayant, Dhruv, Aritra, Tanmay). They paved the way for us to understand and appreciate how music should be performed and the importance of the fundamentals in the process. Performing in the Inter IIT Cult Meet in Roorkee and Mumbai and staying back for Mood Indigo to see my Club perform (one of the best decisions I ever made!) shall forever remain one of my most memorable experiences so far.",
      "I couldn‚Äôt end this piece without the special mention for the most unexpectedly valuable bond I have made in these four years and that I hope to see flourishing and getting stronger by the day in the years to come, even if we are half the globe apart. Shreyasi has been the person whose growth (read: metamorphosis) in these four years has inspired me the most. From a naive, timid fresher to the strong, independent, and highly motivated person she has grown into and still strives to become each day, despite the endless challenges I‚Äôve seen her face, her resilience has been commendable. There have been so many times when I have seen her fall and break, only to fight back stronger than ever. Despite being opposites in so many traits, there still has been something so warm and unprecedented about this bond that has made it endure many difficult phases. It has always felt like ‚Äòhome‚Äô to be in it.",
      "Nobody has seen the future, but I wish from my heart‚Äôs core that every single person who is a part of this little family of mine (and has added so much warmth, meaning, and love to the treasure full of memories of mine in these four years) finds all the love, happiness, peace and glory in life, and we do keep coming back to our alma-mater, even as just an excuse to celebrate our bonds, music and the best four years of our lives that speak volumes of courage, freedom with responsibility and of immense growth and learning.",

      "The ‚Äúas we leave‚Äù series impacted me even before stepping onto the roads of IIT Kanpur, and I was eager to share my experience with the world when I finally reached this point in my life.",
      "Of the many ways to tell my story, the movie Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, derived from the German book ‚ÄúDAS PARFUM,‚Äù which highlights the concept of scent as a symbol for the soul, motivated me to communicate this narrative as the soul is the manifestation of the entity so does my IITK journey define me as an individual.",
      "Perfumery comprises three chords: head, heart, and base notes, with the head chord infusing the initial impression before giving way to the heart chord, which is the perfume‚Äôs theme, and ultimately the base chord, which is the perfume‚Äôs long-lasting trail.",
      "‚ÄúLet everything happen to you: beauty or terror, keep going. No feeling is final.‚Äù",
      "Our batch Y20 (PG) began in online mode. My interactions with the IITK during this one-year online semester centred around MOOKit, Zoom calls, WhatsApp assignments, and online quizzes, which gave me a look into the life of an IITian. It‚Äôs akin to how a perfume‚Äôs head note creates an initial impression. I felt alienated from the energising campus life I desired. Despite this, I have taken the opportunity to deliberately interact in campus activities by participating in various online workshops and trying out diverse positions of responsibility. My 1st attempt went terrible, but perseverance enabled me to occupy positions in multiple disciplines, allowing me to develop and practice my abilities as a DPGC student representative, marketing organiser at Udghosh, and secretary at CWC, along with a decent CPI of 8.00.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the size of the dog in the fight; it‚Äôs the size of the fight in the dog‚Äù.",
      "The Y20 class was called back to campus in September 2021, and the placement season had already begun. I vividly recall the freezing winter at the library for placement preparation. ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù became my second home for the entire season. After constant tenacity, I received a job offer on the 14th day. This phase challenged my endurance, perseverance, and commitment to the forefront.",
      "Throughout this voyage, I met some of the most incredible individuals and learned how the right people could lend calm to you amid the turmoil. Despite the rigorous intensity of the preparation, I could enjoy my fourth semester to the utmost, with an internship opportunity already in my pocket.",
      "‚ÄúA journey is best measured in experience, not in the destination & mine was an Eternal.‚Äù",
      "We half-heartedly shifted from Hall 6 to Hall 4. However, Hall 4 greeted us with a new year, symbolising the beginning of fresh memories. The ambience of lush greenery and our companions now being winges made us cherish the most unforgettable moments. Late-night lab days, OAT fusion sessions, wild dance mates, sleepovers, Ugadi events, 1st-day movies, exotic Holi celebrations, Hall 7 badminton nights, Doaa canteen chit chats, and the list goes on. In addition, during my internship, I honed my skills in areas like decision-making, dedication, and adaptability. IITK has served as a trampoline for my future endeavours and prepared me to embrace life with greater dignity and pride, despite the odds & gravity of the situation.",

But as Myntra is a product-based company, the interview was more inclined toward product management. This was a new beginning, and friends at IITK taught me that everything is figure-out-able.",

      "Mohd Talib Siddiqui is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. In this edition of As We Leave 2022, he tells us about the friends he made, the life he lived, and the memories he made in the four years of college.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It‚Äôs almost impossible to believe that the four-year journey has ended, and I still feel the clueless fresher who arrived on July 20th, 2018 somewhere inside me, still in disbelief that I made it here.",
      "Most people that arrive here on the first day, struggle for familiarity in the hundreds of unknown faces around them. However, I found myself lucky enough to have some of my closest friends come here with me, and trust me, it was very reassuring. I remember getting over excited when I saw Varun in the lift, and we found out when we were on the same floor. I had known Manan for four years at that time, and he was one of my ‚Äúbhais‚Äù. Probably it was then that my luck ran out xD",
      "This piece will mostly be about me and the experience I‚Äôve had with my friends because the most precious thing you take away from here is people for life. The four years at IIT Kanpur are your metamorphosis; it is you who needs to build the courage to fly wide and fast out into the world.",
      "The first semester began, and we saw great bottlenecks at gate 3 everyday, nothing less than a long traffic jam. So, I and Atin had the exact same schedule in semester 1 because most of our other friends were in the opposite batch. I will never forget the PUBG duos in the breaks and the dreaded Sundays (yes, we had a Monday TA lab). From a ‚Äúrevision after class‚Äù and ‚Äúsleeps at 10 pm‚Äù Atin, we have definitely come a long way to be going to Korea together. Seeing people participate in clubs, events, and freshers‚Äô night did give me a big FOMO. Still, I couldn‚Äôt find my way there because I hesitated. The morning HSS classes were the most painful, because we found ourselves in the wing balcony talking random stuff at 3 am, exercising our new found freedom of staying up late. Chauhan, decent guy, the punctual one, was the one to drag me to those classes. Asking for his notebook for the solutions to practice questions was usual, because of course, Chauhan is Chauhan. The first semester flew by in freshers‚Äô, Udghosh (2018 one was good) and Antaragni. A lot of my friends and I found ourselves organizing TOSC. It was a fun experience visiting schools and advertising it. Looking back it all sounds stupid, but it definitely was fun at that time, and that is what matters.",
      "The second semester was pretty much everybody realising what MTH people are gonna get in the coming years. I had a lot of fun in Techkriti show management, which is the only fest I worked in. The only thing you need to know from that is, that Shikhar might look scary at first sight, but all he is angry about is the existence of strawberries üôÇ",
      "Then there comes the summer, where you hear everybody do gazillion things in the two months that you get and you don‚Äôt know what to do. I was nobody different. I was advised by a lot of my batchmates to do a lot of things, but I simply didn‚Äôt know how. So I gathered a bunch of friends and we decided to do a CSE organised summer of code thing. Trust me, living on the top floor in the summers isn‚Äôt fun. We stayed in the worst part of Hall 3, where there was no water, it was very very hot, and you couldn‚Äôt even turn on the lights in your wing because of the bees. So pretty much, it was the worst you could get. What made it bearable was the people I spent time with, because the days went by adjusting and we were all having fun with it. From bathing in other wings, to fighting over filling water bottles, to playing skribbl.io with 10-12 people in the library because it had AC, we did it all in the summers.",
      "I had a bag full of memories already, from Chauhan being stuck in the mud waist high, to having him lose 4 pairs of slippers in 3 weeks, from Shashwat showing his dance moves he used to learn in freshers‚Äô practice, to him studying MTH102 with me a night before midsem, from roasting Siddharth supporting Delhi in IPL, to celebrating Prithvi Shaw‚Äôs miss of his century, from us learning to play frisbee at 2am to witnessing Siddharth‚Äôs and Manan‚Äôs FIFA matches by bunking classes. I could go on and on, and these might be very stupid and common incidents for most people out there, but for a person like me who did not like socializing at all, these were a treasure. I knew that us going to different halls would not be a problem, because people said it limits your interactions and you would interact with your hallmates more, but I knew this was different, and we are still here.",
      "I forgot to mention a five person trip we had just before the summers, planned with the OG and executed well; it was after that, that I took pride in planning trips for my group üôÇ",
      "The first year shenanigans were over, and we were in for a bumpy ride through the ESCs and the TA labs. From trying to get up early to attend classes, to not caring after getting locked out of the classroom at 8 am, it was again a wild ride. Many things did change though, from seeing the GC from Hall-13, to witnessing it from Hall 3, was altogether a different experience. Even though I had little or no impact on any aspect of it, I was amazed by the difference in how I saw it from Hall 13 being a fresher. From the breathless experience in Antaragni, to Akhilesh getting to know us closely, third semester had a lot to offer, which I will not bore you upon, if you still haven‚Äôt given up reading.",
      "",
      "Everybody knows what the fourth semester‚Äôs highlight was, not surprisingly, COVID-19. The cursed virus which derailed us. The first few days of the lockdown were all fun and games, in the hopes that this is gonna pass soon. But as the months went by, it became a routine. It was gloomy, to say the least, but it would have been much worse if not for the people I had. Internships, grades, and semesters were secondary, the frustration I felt was immense. I was not one to enjoy waking up, sitting at my laptop the whole day, and sleeping again.",
      "Tough times for everybody, we did manage to sneak out to Lucknow a couple times. Celebrating the success of our peers, got limited to discord calls, Rocket League lobbies, and Skribbl games. It was not as joyous as it should have been, but nobody had a choice. We were fortunate at times, and a bit unfortunate too. For me, it was the best news I had heard in 2+ years, when the Y18s were allowed to come to campus. Seeing so many people back was nothing short of emotional and heartwarming. It was not as lively, because of the limited people back, and some of my friends still decided to stay back home. There have been a very few incidents where I have been carried away, and this was one of them. It was as if I‚Äôd been let out of confinement that I just roamed days and nights without doing anything. I began disconnecting from my academics, the only thing I worked on my entire IITK life. If it wasn‚Äôt for Chauhan lecturing me for an hour straight, I would probably not have gotten back to working that time.",
      "It was soon the last semester and everybody was on campus. You could see small little groups of people all around having fun, laughing and chatting. But it was accompanied by the realization that this would be one last time back at campus. Days flew by, and we justified our every mischief as a ‚Äòlast‚Äô. It was all fun until I realized I was leaving the next day. That was the longest night on the campus for me. It was the end to all it gave me; it was the realization that I won‚Äôt get up in the morning with my best friends living in the room next to mine. I strolled all night through the campus with tears in my eyes, trying to capture every last corner of it before I went. It was hard to leave my room, to leave my mates, and exit through campus gates one last time as a student.",
      "You would wonder why I did not talk about interns, placements, academics, etcetera. Everybody talks about it; everybody knows that it is important. But as I leave this place, I am made to realize that friends, memories, trips, fun are equally as important. This is more of a thank you note to my friends, which I take away from IITK. And my advice to people who would leave after is to step out, have fun, and make friends because that would be the dearest thing to you when you leave.",
      "To Atin, for being the constant supporter and encourager to push me. To Priyal, for being my emotional stronghold. To Chauhan, for dragging me back on track every time. To Shashwat, for teaching me innumerable things. To Farzan, for all the geeky conversations. To Ankit, for showing what carefree means. To Varun, for putting alarms and sleeping through only to ruin my sleep. To Siddharth, my fellow pen fight champ. To Aditya, destroying us 1v3 in badminton. To Akhilesh, for founding the legendary discord server with me. To Manan, for giving me FOMO to study. To Prakhar, for those enlightening conversations. To Sanchit, teaching us some useful fraud tricks :p. To Shikhar, for the hype. To Shivam, for every sport we played. To Rajoriya, for political banter. To Shobhit, for not coming with us in the wing :(. To Shivangi, for the small group we found in the end. To Jiya, being the most savage ever. To Bansal, for the GOATED fusfus bottle. To ShashKEKWat, for the scam he did to me. To Bhuvan, for the 508th intern treat. To Ipsita, for being the amazing food appreciator. To Ananya, for all the pending outings we have.",
      "I celebrate this end, in the hope of new beginnings to come. Adios IITK! You will always have a place in my heart.",

      "OK, finally, comes the time of your campus life when you try to recollect your memories and just want to relive them all over again, forgetting about the Vox deadlines. You try to compress all of your experiences and learning into a brief article. It‚Äôs really tough. This is the story of a guy who started confused, gained some clarity, and eventually cultivated his own path on campus.",
      "By the way, I am Kumar Ashish Raj, a dual-degree Y17 student. Some of you may recognize me from Prayas, the Design and Animation Club, or as a Chemical Engineering Undergrad. Just a typical guy who loves to explore campus life tries a lot of things, fails at a lot of things, makes some really good friends, and is on a journey to find things he really cares about.",
      "Well, I tried to become a student guide (bapu) for 6-8 freshers by the end of my first year. Instead, I ended up being a guide for 120 students at Prayas. When I could not get into Antaragni Core Team, my passion for design led me to co-found the Design and Animation Club. Furthermore, when I couldn‚Äôt get a third-year summer internship from the SPO, I started my own design freelancing business. I weighed 92 kgs once due to poor eating habits. But now, after developing a healthy lifestyle, I weigh 75! The point is,",
      "‚ÄúThere will be times when you‚Äôll think that all the doors are closed for you. But every failure opens a new door to something beautiful. ‚Äú",
      "It was July 22nd, 2017 when I entered the premises of Hall V with great ambitions to explore the most beautiful campus I had ever seen. I met two people, Srivar Burla (my roomie) and Aditya Shivaji Yamulwad, who would go on to become my best buds for years to come. I wanted to explore as many things as I could on the campus full of varied prospects (academic and non-academic).First-year is the time when you learn how to prioritize thingsout of the multiple things that keep on happening simultaneously.",
      "I started my exploration with the dance club for the freshers‚Äô dance. Even today, when I hear ‚Äútenu suit suit karda‚Äù I just pause for a bit and smile. After that, the Takneek started, where different SNT clubs started hoisting sessions. I explored Speed Cubing and the Electronics Club and stayed there for the whole year.",
      "Then I joined Antaragni‚Äôs design team which rekindled my love for designing and photoshop. Then came The Galaxy, where I learned a lot just by participating in Fine Arts and Photoshop events. I remember the big backdrop that we worked on for weeks in the hall V Multipurpose room that was finally installed on the gate of OAT. It was the first time I witnessed the unity of a hall where everyone was trying their best to win a particular trophy and, in the process, learning new skills and making new friends.",
      "I stayed at the campus for the summers for the SNT project under E-Club, a graphic design internship, Antaragni, and Fine Arts Club. Then came a day that literally changed my life and my priorities. Shobit Jagga (Y17), a friend of mine, told me about a club calledPrayas, where they used to teach kids in the evening. I went with him that day and talked to the then-coordinator, Meghansh. He assigned me to a junior class. After taking my first class, I felt that I had finally found something I could commit to. I loved teaching in the past but did not realize that I could excel in this skill here on campus.I had the best sleep that day for a very long time. Then, afterward, I used to show up there almost every day, even when it was not my turn to volunteer.",
      "In the second year, the departmental courses started and I met my chemical engineering friends. My goal was always to get above-average marks and I was happy with that. For the Family Man fans,I was a ‚Äòminimum guy‚Äô in academics ‚Äì someone who puts in the bare minimum effort to get decent gradesand focused mostly on the extra-curriculars.",
      "During my time at Antaragni (in the design team), the most notable work was designing the T-Shirt for Antaragni‚Äô18. It took over a month to finalize the design and that too after 35-40 iterations, and finally, ‚ÄúTShirt_V_26.3.psd‚Äù was released.Having exclusive design skills was like a superpower on campus as it was in high demand but in limited supply back then.",
      "In the evenings, I used to take classes at Prayas and got addicted to the love and affection I received from the kids. Whenever I used to enter the classes, the kids would just run and hug me ‚Äî the feeling was surreal. I got along with Meghansh and Ekta, the then coordinators of Prayas and my closest people to date, and started hanging out with them more often, and those are still some of my best memories.",
      "After that, all the clubs and fests were looking for new coordinators and core team members. After two years of dedicated work, I decided to fill out the form for the Head Design of Antaragni. The interview was long and mentally exhausting. The whole evening, I sat in front of my phone waiting for the only call I needed so badly. Surprise! The phone did not ring, and that was one of the weak moments in my life when the world seemed to collapse in front of my eyes.",
      "Before the Antaragni results were announced, I was approached to apply for the post of Prayas Coordinator. I applied and got selected, which felt like a silver lining of hope in my life.",
      "While I was happy at Prayas, losing Antaragni and, with that, designing was something I was still recovering from. The story of design in my life was almost over for me, and it was eating me from the inside. One day, I heard that some of my design friends were talking about opening a new club. This was a little ray of hope for me. It was like a new door revealing itself. We joined hands, and we drafted a detailed proposal and put it in the senate. Fast forward toApril 10th, 2019, we finally got our own Design and Animation Club (DnA) approved. We used to rant a lot about the type of design and posters that are made in the fest with tough deadlines and an innate need to change them, and then God was like ‚ÄúOkay, show me what you have got.‚Äù",
      "Third-year was supposed to be hectic. This year, I came close to knowing who I really was (yet figuring out) and tested my dedication and work ethic. I was the coordinator of DnA and Prayas simultaneously, which was tough.A typical third-year day started with the regular classes and labs, followed by Prayas from 4:30‚Äì8:00 pm, and ended with DnA club meetings and activities.The days were enjoyably hectic. I did not usually spend enough time in my wing. My wingies used to complain that my room was always locked, and I wish I could have spent more time with them. They are nice people, xD.",
      "The most challenging part was laying the foundation of the DnA club. I still remember Chirag‚Äôs Room, the official headquarters for the club, where we used to discuss everything with colorful markers on his whiteboard. We gained a lot of appreciation from the campus junta, which kept us motivated. The real game-changer for our club was the Y19 orientation video which was and is an overnight sensation. It was a showreel of all of our past works combined with great motion graphics and music. Writing this down, I can still hear the screams of Y19 students on that day in the auditorium. The whole campus was talking about it and wanted to be a part of the club. Back then, everything was new and people had never seen things like this done on the campus. We laid the whole roadmap of the club‚Äôs activities, from the design workshops, freshers‚Äô events, competitions in the galaxy, and club personal projects, to the Inter-IIT Cult meet and online tutorial-based workshops during the pandemic. Lack of guidance made it challenging yet exciting. We were running a start-up in some sense.",
      "I used to be actively involved in Prayas activities too. I got a lot of guidance from the ex-coordinators on how to run things here. We used to regularly visit the kids‚Äô houses which certainly widened our perspective about society and made us realize the privileges of the campus. For me, Prayas is a small effort to give back to society. The Prayas culture is more like a family, and you kind of get along pretty well.",
      "The real setback I got was during the internship session. While a lot of my friends were seriously preparing for internships for the next summer, I did not bother much, which is why I really got confused about my career options after each failed attempt at tests and interviews. Even with a resume filled with varied experiences and a decent CPI, I could not get any internships from the SPO.",
      "I specifically remember two HR questions that I was asked during a practice session in the Departmental COM class- (a) Tell me something about yourself, and (b) Where do you see yourself in 5 years? These questions created an atmosphere of self-doubt, fear, and lack of confidence in me. I could not write a single word for half an hour. I had read about how to answer HR questions, but at that time, they all seemed artificial. I started answering the first question, ‚ÄúFrankly, I do not know who I really am. I love to teach kids and design in my spare time, but no one is going to give me a job for that. So, I am going to write several answers to this question based on the profile I might apply‚Ä¶‚Äù I left the second question blank. Tears rolled from my eyes sitting on the last row of L12.",
      "The end of the third year was really tragic due to the pandemic. It was like someone had cut off the lifeline wire.",
      "The pandemic was the first time in many years that I had stayed away from active campus life for so long. I finally got some time for myself and gained a little clarity about my future and career. I wrapped up an animation video project called ‚ÄúUnsaid‚Äù from the club, which was the club‚Äôs biggest project. Every frame of the video was custom-made by the team, and it helped me understand the typical workflow of an animated movie. The video was finally released during the lockdown, making people nostalgic about the campus.",
      "There was a huge responsibility on the team to figure out how to run Prayas online. Through distribution drives, we ensured every student had access to the books and stationery. Finally, after huge efforts, the classes went online and I volunteered for the high school classes.",
      "In the summer of 2020, I started looking for internships. Since it was a pandemic time, the opportunities were limited. This was the time when I became serious about the freelancing world. I created my account on Fiverr and posted all my past work. I figured out that new businesses require an explainer video to sell their products. It took me about a month to finally get my first client from Australia, who compensated me well for my work. This was the biggest earning I had with my animation video back then. After that, I started getting regular clients and continuously improved my animation skills through a series of self-projects posted on my Instagram. Instead of getting an internship, I found freelancing.",
      "Coming to the dual story, I had never thought about pursuing a masters in the Chemical department, mainly because I had very little interest in my department. But a very close friend of mine convinced me to pursue it by justifying it for three reasons: (a) a master‚Äôs may drive my interest in this department; (b) we may get one more year of offline semesters, and (c) better placement opportunities. Then I finally pursued it, and I think it was worth it.",
      "Staying at home for around 1.5 years with my family improved my mental health. But, the lack of movement due to lockdown seriously distorted my physique‚ÄîI weighed 92 kgs back then! I finally, on January 5th, 2021, decided to do something about it and started gymming. Yes, it was my New Year‚Äôs resolution (xD) and after around three months,I lost around 15 kgs.Gyming and a proper diet have become a part of my lifestyle now and have changed my life forever. On campus, I used to go to the gym with my favorite gym bros, Chirag and Aditya Tiwari. Having a small group keeps you consistent.",
      "Even though I was freelancing, I wanted to work in corporate for some time. So I decided to sit for the placements. I had seen the craze of coding in my internship. I had never given a fair chance to coding and decided to explore this field. I got two internships with a few online courses on machine learning, data science, and product management.",
      "Eventually, by solving problems on Leetcode consistently, I started to get good at coding.I think many people do not like coding, maybe because they haven‚Äôt tried it well.It is intimidating in the beginning, but once you get past the threshold, it serves you well.",
      "I came back to campus in September to start my thesis work and placements. My work was completely experimental and could not be done online. My friends and I used to update each other about our placement preparations. Having a group of 2-3 people around during such stressful times really helps avoid burnout. For me, they were Abhishek, Zeeshan (the man with many names, officially Jeeshan xD), Sunamya, and Anirban who were there for me at all times.",
      "Placement tests started in October. The frequency of tests started to increase as we got closer to D-Day. I got shortlisted for some SDE and product roles. After a series of interviews on Day 1 and Day 2, I finally got placed on Day 2 at VMock as a Product Analyst. The interaction I had was very friendly, and in the end,the interviewer also asked me for tips for fat loss xD.Although I was happy to be placed on Day 2, since my preparations were mostly for SDE roles, I was a little disheartened as well to land in a product role.",
      "The last semester is something that every batch deserves for closure. With things getting back to normal, we had to reinitiate the workings of Prayas in offline mode. It was my dream to see kids again in offline classes. The current coordinators of Prayas, Nishant, and Darshana really kicked it off, and finally, after lots and lots of follow-ups, on the 30th of March, 2022, we got a 2-word response from the DOSA: ‚ÄúApproved, SP.‚Äù Prayas went offline, and it was really great to see that energy as kids reentered the premises of Prayas after two long years.",
      "I really believe that this campus has a lot to offer, and it all depends on what you are looking for.Get out of your rooms and explore every bit of it if possible, because that‚Äôs the only way to figure out what you actually love.Try out different things. You might suck at those things in the beginning, but that‚Äôs okay because you will get better at things you like by staying consistent.Comparing yourself with others is the worst thing that you could do.These were the best 5 years of my life and if given a chance, I would not change a single event.",
      "Feel free to reach out if you need any kind of help. My days at Prayas have taught me that helping someone is obviously the best thing you can do for them, but the point is that it‚Äôs mutual; the best thing for you as well. This journey would not be possible without some very special people in my life. Zeeshan, Abhishek, Anirban, Sunamya, Chirag, Aditya Tiwari, Srivar, Aditya Yemulwad, Rakshit, Archit Mishra, Ashish Gupta, Ekta, Meghansh, Nishant, Darshana, and Prayas Family ‚ù§Ô∏è.",
      "And last but not least, I would like to thank Vox for providing this wonderful opportunity.",

      "Mrigya Gupta is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In this edition of As We Leave 2022, she talks about her experiences, choices and decisions that shaped her undergraduate journey throughout her stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "20th July 2018. My journey at IIT Kanpur began on a hot and sunny day. I was extremely excited to see the beautiful campus that would be my home for the next four years. I had never been away from home before, but my apprehensions faded away on meeting mybehens,and I knew it would be great fun to live in a hostel. The first week of Orientation was very memorable. I met one of my closest friends during the bank session when we were both feeling cold because of the AC xD. As the shouts of ‚ÄòIITK ka tempo high hai‚Äô echoed in the auditorium on the last day of the Orientation, I felt ready for an adventurous four years.",
      "The first semester was a time of exploring and trying out new things. I was fascinated by the vast campus and the multitude of activities always taking place. My Open Mic Performance during Freshers‚Äô Night amid the crowd chanting ‚ÄòSimon Go back‚Äô, thoroughly exploring the campus during the Treasure Hunt night out, Antaragni pronites, getting lost on my way to the TA lab ‚Äì it felt like the time of our lives!",
      "However, no journey can be smooth all the time. The first year had been filled with the euphoria of coming to a new place and forming several new friendships. But I could not fulfil one of my primary personal goals.",
      "Before coming to IITK, I wasn‚Äôt really sure about my interests and ended up filling my JoSAA choices based on my rank. After talking to seniors and understanding the opportunities within various branches, I wanted to switch to a different branch. So, I resolved to study hard in the first year and aim for a branch change. I tried to be consistent in all my courses while exploring clubs and participating in different activities. I even spent my winter break studying PHY103 and ESC101. Unfortunately, at the end of my first year, I could not change my branch.",
      "My plans for the summer break also did not work out. I could not get any summer project, despite emailing several professors. I applied for the IITK Summer of Code but was not selected. I finally decided to stay on campus and take some courses.",
      "These experiences shook my self-confidence to the core. I entered my third semester feeling rather lost and uncertain. Most of my friends had spent productive summers, while I thought I had done nothing worthwhile. I did not particularly like any of my department courses that semester. In this mode of self-doubt, I started spending a lot of time in the library reading novels. My efforts toward academics dropped considerably. I made a series of bad choices-not attending several classes, studying at the very last minute for quizzes and exams, and missing the Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy concert because I was panicking about a quiz the next day‚Ä¶the list can go on. It was certainly the hardest phase of my time at IITK.",
      "I remember receiving the grades for that semester and staring at them in stunned silence. My SPI had dropped considerably. Over the winter, I realized that I was giving up too soon. I spent a lot of time introspecting and decided not to let a few bad experiences cloud my future potential.",
      "The fourth semester began, and I was determined to make things better. Eventually, I made peace with my branch and decided to explore it further. I started working on a project with a department professor and enjoyed the experience. I went to classes enthusiastically, and my performance in courses began improving.",
      "This was a defining experience for me. I realized the importance of accepting that things sometimes go against expectations. Life is not always a smooth journey. There will be challenges along the way. The best way to deal with them is to stay optimistic and never lose faith in your abilities. What may seem like a significant setback at the moment can be a great learning experience for the future.",
      "My experiences in the third semester made me want to help others, and I felt that the Counselling Service would be the best avenue to do that. I applied and was elated to be selected as a Core Team Member. Just as we were in the middle of conducting SG interviews and excitedly deciding dress codes for the Handing Over Ceremony, the pandemic struck. The weeklong midsem break became 1.5 years away from campus.",
      "Joining the Counselling Service has been one of the best decisions that I took during my college life. During my time at home, the regular zoom meetings and planning virtual events helped me to feel connected to campus life. The interactions with several students made me a more empathetic and confident person. CS also introduced me to a fantastic bunch of friends, making the experience more rewarding.",
      "I started preparing for the upcoming internship season. I wasn‚Äôt sure about what profiles I was interested in, but I did know that I was not interested in core or software profiles. I decided to aim for data science, analytics and techno-managerial roles. The internship season can often be confusing for many as not everyone is sure about what they want to do in the future. Talking to many seniors and reading up about different profiles helped me get some clarity.",
      "I did not get an offer on Day 1 of the internship season. I continued taking several company tests but wasn‚Äôt getting shortlisted. My anxiety and impatience grew with each passing day. Fortunately, I was at home at this time, as my parents and sister helped me stay calm. I finally received an internship offer from Gartner a week later. That was certainly one of the highlights of my time at IITK. I was also relieved as I had almost not taken the Gartner test. I had been exhausted from taking so many tests, so I decided to skip the Gartner test. Fortunately, one of my friends convinced me to at least take the test. I did well in the test, got shortlisted, and eventually received an offer. This was a significant learning for me; you miss 100% of the shots you do not take!",
      "The third-year went by in a flurry of assignments, quizzes, video calls with friends and the occasional hope that we would be called back to campus soon. My summer internship at Gartner went well, and I received a Pre-Placement Offer. I was very happy, as I did not want to sit for placements. However, after talking to some seniors, I felt that consulting would be a good fit for me, and I started preparing for case interviews. I have been lucky to have met some great seniors who patiently went through my resume iterations, gave me useful advice, and helped me with the interview preparation.",
      "The interview day arrived. Bain and BCG interviews were scheduled on consecutive days. After three interview rounds with Bain, I did not get the offer. I was dejected but determined to do my best for the next day of interviews with BCG. After five interviews and several hours of nervously waiting for the results, I received an offer from BCG! I was delighted. The cherry on the cake could now only be a mail calling students back to campus.¬†And a month and a half later, we received the much-awaited email calling Y18 students back to campus!",
      "It was hugely nostalgic to return to campus after so long. I remember entering my old room and feeling that a different version of myself had left that room all those days back. So many significant milestones and changes had happened in the time spent at home. I could feel a catharsis of emotions as I reconnected with friends and hung out again at familiar spots. Soon enough, it felt like we had never left.",
      "The final semester was a perfect culmination of my IITK journey. It felt like living the entire IITK experience in fast-forward mode in four months. The pandemic made it even more special; everyone was eager to soak in every moment. With several night outs, all three fests, and two trips- it couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect.",
      "All too soon, the end was in sight. No dues forms were filled, and bags were packed. I will never forget the love, laughter and tears of the final few days. As people left, there were last hugs, promises to keep in touch and sad farewell songs playing in the background. Running high on sleep deprivation and emotion, those last days were a testament to how wonderful the IITK experience had been.",
      "IITK has been a transformative journey for me. It has taught me many things, most importantly the importance of self-belief and the power of optimism.",
      "For my juniors- IITK will offer you many challenges and present you with many opportunities. You have to choose how to navigate through them. It is time-consuming to figure out your interests, and often that process is not easy. You can make a conscious choice to learn from every experience instead of getting bogged down by them. IITK is a place filled with surprisingly helpful peers and seniors, so never hesitate to reach out for help. There may be unfavourable outcomes at times. But with resilience and patience, you will eventually emerge a stronger person.",
      "The best part about my IITK journey has been the amazing people I met. I am so grateful for the friends who were there for me through all the highs and lows. They have helped me transition from a JEE-cleared school kid to an adult ready to go out into the world. Special mention to those who taught me how to become more ‚Äòchill‚Äô about everything üòä.",
      "I will miss going into a friend‚Äôs room just to decide what to wear or going to the OAT to grab a roll at 3 AM. I will miss sitting in the mess for an hour just to talk or attending lectures together. Every bit of the IITK experience has been all the more special because of all these people. Though our journeys now diverge, I know that the bonds we share will last forever.",

      "Kaushiki Agarwal is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Material Science and Engineering. In this edition of As We Leave 2022, she reminisces about how she got to IITK with anxiety and apprehensions about arriving in a new world till leaving IITK with memories, aims and the sadness of being separated from this world.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "So, this is my journey. It begins with entering IIT Kanpur with many hopes and aspirations and some anxiety about arriving in a new world with everyone around unknown. Till leaving IITK with a big bundle of memories, new aims and the sadness of being separated from those unknowns who today have become a crucial part of my life.",
      "As I entered this campus, it was far from my imagination, and the excitement of being at this fantastic place seemed worth it. The family system of CS, one of the many unique aspects of the IITK culture, was the first thing I liked (maybe because my ‚ÄòAmma‚Äô, Esha, was just GREAT). As the orientation ended with the 1st-semester beginning, real campus life started.",
      "Recollecting things, 1st semester was just about understanding and adapting to this new place. I struggled to cope with academics, almost being on the verge of failing PHY103. From the beginning, we started hearing about various dos and don‚Äôts for bagging good placements, with different seniors having their own priority orders. Some emphasized CPI, some PORs, others coding and still others exploring and doing plenty of stuff. And the feeling of not being in the top three departments surrounded me. It took four years to realize that this place has a lot of potential to get you wherever you wish to if you are ready to work for it.",
      "",
      "During the 1st semester, I didn‚Äôt do much stuff. Still, I took part in some activities like freshers, treasure hunt, some events of clubs organized for freshers and joined the AUV team around the end of the semester. At the end of the first semester, I realized that I needed to be stable academically; otherwise, it would become very stressful. The 2nd semester was decent enough as I managed my studies better. Though I didn‚Äôt do great in courses, I was satisfied with my performance. I was only involved in the AUV team during 2nd semester. However, I did not enjoy myself much there because I was the only girl in Y18. There was only one Y17 senior girl in the team who also used to come less frequently. As a result, I couldn‚Äôt mingle with the team members much. I stayed in the summers and joined athletics along with AUV but left AUV after summers as going there felt like a burden more than a recreation and continued with athletics for the 3rd semester.",
      "Another thing that I will never forget is becoming SG. Reliving the orientation was fun, and having a sweet bond with those ‚Äòbacchis‚Äô. I could have never had such a connection with the juniors if I weren‚Äôt SG. That was a wonderful experience.",
      "",
      "Time passed, and slowly and gradually, this campus started to feel homely, and I started to enjoy the so-called campus life. One reason also is that with time I had made some friends without whom today I couldn‚Äôt even imagine my stay here. One of the best memories is just sitting and chit-chatting with these friends. No topics needed, no occasions required, no free time needed. All we needed was us. These talks could carry on for hours, even during exams (I am really going to miss these discussion sessions). As everything was going well, COVID struck. As we left the campus during the 4th-semester mid-sem break, who knew we would return only in our last semester. The online life was quite monotonous, and things just wrapped around zoom and Google meet. I still feel how many more precious moments we would have gathered if we had spent those two years on campus. As said, every coin has two sides ‚Äì one positive thing which resulted from Covid, pointed out by one of my friends, is that Covid probably taught us to be in contact. Even after being far away, this could let us be in touch even after we all will be in different places leading different lives.",
      "Thenthere was the hustle of internships and placements. That time was very stressful, but as I think of it today, it played a crucial role in making me more confident and stronger. As I said, we were in an environment that made us believe that being in the top 3 departments or coding is necessary for getting good internships and placements. I would say here that it is not about where you get through JEE, but how you do here will decide what you can achieve.",
      "Then comes the last semester, or should I call it the BEST semester (couldn‚Äôt every semester be the last semester). After two years of homestay, we finally returned to campus. All excited to collect as much as we could from the remaining four months of campus, college and student life. And to be true, we did. The start wasn‚Äôt good enough as the 3rd wave of covid took over, and most students fell ill. We dreaded that again anytime we could be sent back home. But this time, we were fortunate not to be sent back and utilized this opportunity to the fullest. This particular semester was the gist of our entire IITK duration. It had everything in it ‚Äì online classes, offline classes, Antaragni, Techkriti, Udghosh, major club events and the hostel life. Time was less, and the to-do list was too long. The memories we made during this time are very close to my heart, and I love them.",
      "There are so many things which, if possible, I would just pack and keep with me. I couldn‚Äôt do justice to all, but some things which come to my mind are ‚Äì the late-night walks, the random room talks, the mess table panchayat, OAT time pass spot, securing a seat in the library during exams, crying for grades, rushing for 8 am classes, some night outs, the 3rd floor AB block terrace, the zoom meetings with friends, some gyan sessions given to friends and also taken from them, the assignments of ESO205 and many more‚Ä¶.",
      "",
      "But of all, the most precious thing this place has given me is the FRIENDS without whom I couldn‚Äôt have survived. These lifelong friends are the biggest asset I am taking away along with me from here. Here are those SPECIAL people ‚Äì",
      "Neha Aggarwal and Aastha Ramteke ‚Äì constants since day 1, Nandita Gupta ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt have been attending the convocation if it weren‚Äôt for her,¬† Ruby Kumari ‚Äì endless talks, I think we utilized the unlimited calling feature ultimately. These people were there with me in all my highs and lows, be it courses, placements, crying with or laughing. Not to forget Shreya Kacholia ‚Äì we can just debate on anything and Ayushi Maheswari ‚Äì the best parts wouldn‚Äôt have been best without her. Each of them is very close to my heart, and I feel fortunate to have them in my life. Yet some more friends worth a mention ‚Äì Ramveer, Sanyam and Saikat, who were an integral part of my best semester. Thank you to all these people for giving me so many memories to cherish lifelong.",
      "As I leave this beautiful place, all I can say is that this place has transformed me from an ordinary girl to a confident and independent young lady. I have not only added a B.Tech degree to my qualifications from here but have added an immense amount of personality development which would have never been possible otherwise. I want to say to all reading this that being here is one of the best things you could have had in your life, so live this time as you want regardless of how others tell you to live. Enjoy a lot, don‚Äôt be worried if you are not able to perform good all the time in anything, be it academics or any other place you are involved, don‚Äôt hesitate to explore new things (I regret not doing this), don‚Äôt compare yourself with others and while doing all this do not spoil your academics to the extent that it becomes irreparable, not because CPI is important but because if academically things are not going right, it gives stress which hinders your joyful journey. And above all, make good friends because life here wouldn‚Äôt be at its best without them.",

      "Ankit Kumar is a Y18 graduating student from the Department of Civil Engineering. In this edition, hereminisces his journey from ‚Äúnot an original fresher‚Äù to accomplishing his goal of doing something unique and remarkable during his stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "",
      "Hello everyone! To be honest, I am very good at writing things like this (as indicated in my social media posts (not LinkedIn, obviously)). Still, I don‚Äôt know how to go about this piece of writing here. Fun Fact: I had dropped a course just because it required me to write a report of 2000 words while I was safely securing an A in that course. So, things have ironically happened to me in these last four years at IITK.",
      "",
      "Okay, now that I have a slight clue to write my AWL, I would start from the very beginning. I was a partial dropper from NIT Kurukshetra, so when I got into IITK, I wasn‚Äôt an ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô fresher. I predicted some things to go in a particular manner, and they did too. I wasn‚Äôt the one who would miss the home or was scared of a new place and people. I have always been an extrovert. Socializing and talking to new people has always been my strength. It made us (me and some of my wingies) go to a random wing in the initial days of orientation for an ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô, and I haven‚Äôt remembered the wing yet. Moving forward, my only (at that time) aim before coming to IITK was to do something different in my own way or do something remarkable, which now I think I was able to achieve. Coming back, I was one of the Departmental Rank Holders at NIT. So, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to academics until I got the first 0 of my life, obviously MTH101A quiz.",
      "",
      "You know there is a weird moment when your roomie gets full marks, and you get a 0? Yes, that was the day. I felt utterly shattered that day. I realized why IIT is different from an NIT. From that day, I accepted that I was an average (below, at times) student. However, I still didn‚Äôt know the importance of CPI at IITK, so my only motive was to pass the courses without worrying about my grades. This continued until I got an E in LIF101A in my second semester. Agree or not, I can assure you that it was due to the change in grading policy that got me to fail. If it weren‚Äôt, I would have surely passed. Fun Fact: I still got a C while repeating the course again with no regrets.",
      "Now, aside from academics for a while, I didn‚Äôt explore the non-academic side of IITK much in my first year. Ironically, I thought of doing this the most when coming to IITK. So, this made me push myself in different clubs, etc., in my second year. I was a part of FAC, AnC Council, Outreach Cell, Udghosh, Techkriti, and SoCE. The one thing I most engaged in my first and second years was Techkriti. The festival gave me very good friends and seniors to whom I can reach out anytime for anything. Cool, side by, I got my first 7+ SPI in my third semester, which increased my CPI to 7.1.",
      "",
      "Now, here comes Corona, too early (?). We didn‚Äôt know it then. I have performed really bad in the mid-semester exams of my fourth semester, and Corona saved my ass. Until now, I can assure you that if Corona hadn‚Äôt been there, I wouldn‚Äôt have been writing this AWL. I would have been busy adjusting my course template for completing my degree in 5 or 6 years. As we switched to online mode, I was blessed with my department wingie (Mridul) and Apes Together Strong, which helped me pass all the courses. By the end of the sixth semester, my CPI had increased to 7.8. The online mode also opened doors to me being overly expressive on social media. I don‚Äôt regret it because it boosted my confidence to face people with different mindsets and opinions. It was a good time when IITK Quarantine Posting and IIM 3.0 posts were worth waiting for. Also, in my third year, I was a part of FAC, SoCE and Techkriti. I joined SoCE as a Coordinator with a vision to take it to greater heights, and as my tenure ended, we (Mradul, Yashkrit and me) saw the change taking place. I joined Techkriti‚Äô21 as a Core Team Member because of my love for Techkriti since my first year and Namit (favourite senior, obviously). But now, I can‚Äôt deny that over time, a toxic culture inculcated in the festival, so I parted ways. But still, I cherish the good moments in the past.",
      "Now, at this point, you must be clear that I am going back and forth, so please bear with me. It is how this piece will go.",
      "WheneverI think of doing something in my third year apart from academics, it is Counselling Service. I put my utmost effort (single-handedly, a very important word here) into joining CS as CTM, but most of them went in vain. As I got to know in the coming years, I can clearly say that when we say that every student body runs through politics, CS is nothing different. People who had been a part of CS have stated it themselves to me that I was not made a part of CS based on internal politics. Still, I respect the people who have tried to maintain the culture of CS by doing their work honestly and enthusiastically. CS was my first (and only, maybe) love at IITK, so I definitely deserve closure on a sour note.",
      "Now, my IITK journey wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without this one person who I met through SOC171A/Rendezvous‚Äô19. Since the third semester, a single person has remained constant with me throughout this journey, so it is worth mentioning her (in detail, obviously). Dona and I became the go-to-person of each other in the online mode. Be it summer internship search, grades and CPI, resume making, personal life or Hunt for Success, we were there for each other. We were the first person to feel happy or sad for each other about anything. I can write a lot about her, but that is what you are not here for. So, saying thank you and moving ahead.",
      "Whenmy eyes were searching for a person like me in the wing on our first night, I saw this guy whom I can call my life saviour. Somu was the first guy I thought would be my kind of person. I was correct. He was with me in my worst on various occasions, which need not be mentioned here since some things should remain unfolded for you all. Life is a bitch, and so are some people, so you have to save the good ones out of them. He is one of them. At this point, I will say, ‚ÄúGuys, main to toot gaya‚Äù.",
      "My As We Leave can‚Äôt be completed without this. The starting quote of my blog says I have always tried to help people at IITK in any way possible. The origin of Hunt for Success was also from here. Until now, people working for several years in the industry cannot understand how a single individual can take one page to this height. I may have been the single person running this initiative. Still, thousands of people motivate me every day to continue this. Also, hundreds of people try to demotivate me every day (not now, hehe).",
      "Moving ahead, I was also living my life to the fullest in the online mode, with all the lows and highs, hoping for campus reopening. Online mode lost some old friends, but it also helped me make new friends in the department and among the juniors.",
      "One needs to know that nothing stays forever. You will encounter different people at different points in your life for small instances. You need to live those moments to the fullest without worrying about when you will be on the verge of separation, and nothing will stay the same.",
      "Wereached campus ‚Äòsoon‚Äô on Oct‚Äô21, and I lived each day on campus as if it was the last. Everyone says that your wingies will be there for you in your best and worst during the placements. I would partially agree with it. In my case, some wingies were there for me before Nov 30. However, no wingie was there for me during the interviews. And some wingies who had sorted their placements even before the placement session were never there for help. Things that seem normal from the outside aren‚Äôt the same if you look at them from the inside, and then people come and ask what our mistake is? So, always remember that only 1-2 people will be there for you during the placements. Don‚Äôt entirely rely on your wingies (unless you are the selfish cry baby, you will get the help). This paragraph must have sounded harsh, but the truth must be told. The names, even if not mentioned, are understandable.",
      "Ican cry for days over this. I have spent the best five months of my life with the best group of friends one can ever come across. As known, I am the only person to be a part of two festival core teams. But the bond I share with Team Udghosh‚Äô21 is beyond any Core Team. I had hit the lowest in my personal life this last semester, but I survived because of these people. Be it C108 or B106, each one of us was an entity. I have made uncountable cherishable memories with these people. I am really happy that this will continue further in Bangalore.",
      "As I wrap up my AWL, I will share some of my learnings at IITK with the juniors who still have ample time left at IITK.",
      "Always be the first to interact with people, make them feel comfortable and feel special even if you aren‚Äôt getting the same in return. Trust me, someday you will feel the same too.",
      "Always trust your instinct. No one in the group might support you, but if you think you can do it, you surely can do it. I got your back. Go for it, kiddo.",
      "Always feel happy about the achievements of your dear ones even if you are at your lowest, be their family and trust them more than they trust themselves.",
      "Always try to interact with as many seniors as possible. Every senior will not help you or guide you but trust me, every senior will never misguide you.",
      "Always help others.",
      "I left my last point unexplained. Still, if you ever feel doubtful about it, contact me on LinkedIn, obviously, hehe.",
      "IITK has been a blessing for me. Thank you for everything.",

      "The moment I learned about As We Leave in my first year, I knew I would write one in my final year. Now is the time. This journey of four years is too long to describe in a few words.",
      "So here is a glimpse of my life at IITK. I will focus less on my academics and placement; instead, I will share the thoughts and feelings I experienced on this journey.",
      "I entered college with a huge list of fantasies. Unlike others, I didn‚Äôt want a branch change or a dassa. Like others, I thought maintaining a good CPI was easy, but I soon realized it was much more complex than scoring good marks in school. The first thing I wished for was a group of friends I could explore campus with (sounds a little immature, right?). As usual, the first people I met were my Amma and roommates. My first reaction after meeting all of my behens was ‚ÄúYaar ye sab yahan bhi padhai hi karenge kya? Mujhse to nahi ho payegi ab aur padhayi‚Äù.¬† But aisa nahi hua, campus ne apne mahol mein almost sbko rang liya XD.",
      "So, female friends to ban gaye the but boys se interaction friendship main convert hui treasure hunt se. From the beginning, I didn‚Äôt want to stay in the room or miss anything, so the moment I learned about the treasure hunt, I asked every known person for a team. I felt, ‚ÄúYes, finally, I am creating memories here!!‚Äù. That was the first night out of my life and at IITK as well. Some team members became good friends. We started sitting together. Our seats were also fixed in the lecture hall. We used to bunk class and go to MT then cycling.",
      "",
      "Ab thodi CPI ki bhi baat kr lete h kyuki first semester bakchodi krne me hi nikal diya to CPI to kam aani hi thi. But meri CPI mere friend circle main sbse kam thi. Still, I was okay with it. At that time, I didn‚Äôt realize the significance of a good CPI. I always thought that even if I had a low CPI, I would figure out something for myself.(Try to avoid this, this is almost equivalent to playing with fire). I thought of giving some attention to academics (never actually implemented it). I used to focus on class but failed as I had stopped putting effort into understanding the concept. Nobody guided me, and neither did I ask for help.",
      "",
      "Due to many unforeseen circumstances, I got stuck in the dreaded never-ending loop of thoughts. I also wasn‚Äôt able to communicate properly. I kept imagining and over-thinking past conversations and events and used to wallow in what could‚Äôve happened had I acted differently. Most of my time went into this since these imaginary conversations made me happy, hindering my focus on academics.",
      "",
      "After that, I joined Techkriti as a Junior Executive in the second semester with some friends. At that time, I knew I needed to focus on my studies. Still, since it was a good opportunity to spend time with friends, my priorities shifted (again, a mistake).",
      "",
      "But something unexpected happened during that fest, which disturbed me like hell. I was behaving normally, but I was overthinking and crying. I found no sense in anything. I still remember I was praying just to pass two of the courses. The only fear I had at that time was how would I face my parents after failing a course because I couldn‚Äôt tell what I was going through. I got three D‚Äôs in my second semester.",
      "",
      "The first time I felt bad for my CPI was when I got rejected for Student Guide. I really wanted to be an SG. But this force was insufficient to drive me to study‚Äîmy scholarship got cancelled the second time. My father needed that. I still remember what he said after that ‚Äúmauj masti thori kam krlo, padai pr dhyan do‚Äù. I cried after that call ( and I am crying again while writing this). The only reason was that something disturbed me, and I was unable to focus on what was important. I couldn‚Äôt share what I was going through with anyone else (again, a mistake). Still, the only energy I had went towards behaving normally as someone interacted with me.",
      "",
      "So the first year went by. The only good thing I did for academics in the first year was taking a summer project in my department. I still used to overthink and cry daily since the many things I was connected with disturbed me (and I didn‚Äôt even try to stay away, again a mistake xd). Even though I was drained mentally, I still did it. I also went on a summer trip to Banaras with the photography club. That was my first college trip. It was good in a way that I met new people (which made me happy in those days XD), but it was not what I imagined. First Summer ki ek important cheez to batana hi bhul gayi. I joined Prayas. I still remember my first class. I entirely focused on making students understand the topic. I had nothing else on my mind. And after one hour, the same thoughts hit me again when the class got over again. But I was happy that at least for an hour, I did not overthink, and at that time, I realized I needed to explore more to divert my mind.",
      "With that thought, in my third semester, I joined the FMC club and Techkriti as a Technocruise manager; my friends were not there this time. Instead, I made more contacts with other batchmates, seniors and juniors. I would say my third sem was my recovery phase (After all, I am an MSE student :p). My CPI also increased a little with no D in any course.Now, I used to discuss assignments with people and try to understand the solution but khud se assignment nhi hote the.",
      "The fourth sem was smooth initially, but a few things happened before the mid-sem break, disturbing me a lot. I am thankful for the mid sem and covid break for many reasons. I found myself standing where I started. But thanks to covid, meri CPI nhi giri lekin scholarship phir se cancel ho gayi thi.",

      "Discouraged, I lost the sense of direction during the summer after my 2nd year. I didn‚Äôt think about my future and career and didn‚Äôt even prepare for internships. I had a preconceived notion that internship toh lagni hai nahi, koi project mil jayega kisi prof ke under. Moh maya se man uth gya tha mera XD.Maine kabhi khud ko itna underestimate nahi kiya tha jitna uss time kiya. Mai bss isi motivation ke sath intern mai baithi thi ki interview dene ko mil jayenge jo placement me help krega. But due to CPI and other factors, I didn‚Äôt get a chance to qualify for the interview round. I gave only one interview in which I got rejected.However, I did not feel too bad about this.",
      "Internship session ke kuch mahine baad jab un logo ki bhi intern lag gayi thi jinnse mai khud ko better manti thi tab mujhe laga ki meri bhi intern lag skti thi agar mai seriously leti. Isliye main SIP me bhi baithi and isme meri intern shyd lag bhi jati but mai frequently portal check nhi krti thi jiski wajah se kafi opportunities miss hui. Iska mujhe kafi regret hua. I don‚Äôt know why, but I only wanted an on-campus internship. So I didn‚Äôt try on any other platforms. But aisa kuch nhi hota hai. Internship internship hoti h, chahe off-campus ho ya on campus. Haare hue mann se maine other platforms pr bhi try kiya but not efficiently otherwise lag jati.",

      "",
      "So the first thing I needed to fix was my CPI. Then I had to compensate for not doing an internship and prepare for the placement tests. I did everything step by step in a planned way, but I lacked passion and had to force myself to focus.",

      "I thought I was focused on my placement until the news about ‚Äúresource constraints allowed to return campus‚Äù came. I took this news positively since I faced a lot of network and personal space issues at home (main yaha khulke ro bhi nahi sakti thi xd). But when I heard the news of all the final year students returning to campus, meri heartbeat tej ho gyi. Bahut sari cheezein flash back hui. Ek umeed jagi un cheezon ke thik hone ki jinka laga tha ki ab khatam hi ho gyi.But dar gyi main khud se ki phir se focus na kho do kyunki pta tha mujhe mai phir se disturbed ho jaungi ab. Dar lag rha tha ki khud se iss baar lad paungi ya nhi? But I had no other option than to go to campus because of resource constraints.",
      "",
      "I started preparing for analytics and consulting, leaving coding for obvious reasons XD.I talked to everyone jo mujhe laga ki meri help kar dega preparation mein. Kafi logo se bass isliye connect hui kyuki case study aur GD ki practice karni thi. Placement time par friendships test ho jati h and kafi achhe aur real dost bhi mil jate h. I am thankful to Wrishik, Samyak and Ayushi for their constant support. So stage 2 (placement tests) to dosto ki help se clear ho gaye. Maine software ke liye apply hi nahi kiya tha to companies ki list bhi kafi narrow down ho gayi thi. Test dete time apni preparation ko kafi doubt karti thi because aptitude ke questions achhe se nhi kr pati thi. But I practised really hard.",
      "",
      "Mujhe laga tha ki meri placement day three ke baad hi hogi and main iss cheez ke liye mentally prepare thi, but again I was wrong. Mujhe day one hi survive karna muskil ho gya. I don‚Äôt know yahan days itne hyped up kyu hai? Days ke hisab se kyu judge krte h ki placement achhi hui ya buri. Itna hype kr rakha h ki day three tak placement na ho to insaan khud ko failure samjhne lgta h. Let me stop this topic. I can give a long lecture on this XD. I got shortlisted just for three companies, jisme ek main GD me hi kat gya tha. Dusri me Day 1 interview me. And un dino, din nahi hote the, ghante hote the jo aap ko kaatne hote the wait karte hue. So mujhe kuch samajh nhi aa rha tha mera kya hoga, koi aur company bhi nhi the mere paas but surprisingly on day 2 mai third company mein placed ho gayi. Meri saari behne ro padi thi placement ki khushi me. Everyone was too happy with my placement, and I was shocked to see this. I was also happy because ab mai relax ho gayi thi, aisa lag raha tha ki finally ek battle end hui.",

      "I skipped many things which I experienced after returning to campus. Main disturb hui kafi baar but khud ko sambhal liya placement ki wajah se. Mai iss level tak disturb hui ki counseling ka bhi socha and maine decide kar liya tha ki placement ke baad bhi aise hi disturbed rahi to main counselor ke pass jaa rhi hoon.There were days when I felt broken. Meri placement preparation affects ho rhi thi and ye soch kar mai aur affect ho rhi thi ki mera career mere liye important kyu nahi h. Main ab aur disturb ya hurt nhi hona chahti thi.

      "I am telling this because placement ke baad mujhe yahi lag raha tha ki ye mera 100% nahi h. Agar mai apna 100% deti to kitna jyada better hota. Mujhe placement ke baad apni potential realize hui. But you don‚Äôt give one exam at a time in real life. Instead, you give multiple exams simultaneously, and you have to perform well in each of them to grow overall.",
      "Since the placement battle was over, now I was free to feel what I wanted to feel. I was free to overthink just lying down on my bed. But placement ke baad pura December enjoy karne me chala gaya. Trip par bhi gayi. Enjoyment ki wajah se mental state suppressed ho gayi.Keeping yourself involved in myriads of activities is the best way to avoid confrontation with your thoughts. But mujhse toh yeh nahi hota. I constantly wallow over a problem to understand and solve it rather than find escapades. Yeah, this is a challenge, but in my opinion, it is the only way for your mind to be at ease and free of emotional baggage.",
      "Coming to the last sem, honestly,¬† mera bilkul mann nhi tha campus wapas jane ka. Mujhe ghar ab zyada peaceful lagne laga tha. But ye last sem tha, itne sapne the college life ke, and I wanted the swan-song for my college life to be melodious. Hence I went back. But iss time priority mental health thi, try bhi kiya cheezein fix karne ka but still, wasn‚Äôt successful enough. Cousin ki shadi ke liye ghar vapis aayi thi, aur itna jayeda hurt thi ki vapis jaane ka mn hi nahi kr rha tha. I still remember telling a friend ki mujhe wapas aane ka bilkul mann nhi hai, pta nhi kyu aa rhi hu wapas.",

Ek newfound group bhi bana dosto ka. Jo sari bachi hui cheezein rah gyi thi bucket list ki sab puri ki. The last sem was full of memories. My campus journey from Feb to May was full of healthy days, jab maine ek bhi raat faltu ki cheezon ke baare me sochte huye nhi kati.

Iss umar main zindagi jeeni bhi hai aur savarani bhi hai, so invest your time wisely. You should carefully invest your emotions in the right people at the right time.Whether it‚Äôs friendship or any other relationship, you will lose yourself if you put in more effort. If you put in less effort, you will lose the person (hence, maintain equality :p).",

      "Hi everyone!",
      "‚ÄúNot all those who wander are lost.‚Äù My life has been exactly like this, both in my school and college days. I explored, chose between staying or not staying and then iterated it. I had no fixed abode and had a nomadic lifestyle, but still, I was never without purpose. In this As We Leave, I want to talk about how I explored different things and the choices I made corresponding to these things. The article may not be super fun to read, but I will try to make it a fun read and connect with as many of you as possible. It is difficult to pen down the whole journey in a small article, but I will do it and live the journey again in my thoughts. From this write-up, my batchmates can take away nostalgia, and juniors can take away some gyaan.",
      "Speaking briefly about the situation before coming to IITK, I come from a small town in Haryana. As a result, my parents knew nothing about IIT, what IIT could give me or why I should join it. Even I didn‚Äôt know much. I only had one thing in my mind: to become independent. I had to fight with my parents to get into the coaching classes. I had to justify why I needed coaching. That seems silly now, but I had to choose whether to take a stand or just go for other ordinary things. I decided to convince them. Even after I joined coaching, they never thought that I could ever get admission. They felt I was stubborn and would return home without good results, just like many others who tried. It always hurt me but never mind, they felt good after the result, and so did I.",
      "After coming to IITK, things changed. I had to decide everything by myself. My friends and seniors were the greatest support system, but eventually, you must determine what is good for you. When we came to IITK, our parents were told that you are leaving a child here, and you will get a man back after four years. At that time, I didn‚Äôt realize the transformation they were talking about, but now I can clearly see it in my batchmates and feel it within myself.",
      "I remember the days when preparations for Freshers Night were going on. I gave trials for many clubs, including dance, ELS and Hindi Sahitya Sabha. I remember returning from the dramatics club room door after seeing other people‚Äôs trials going on (LOL). I found that Hindi Sahitya Sabha best suited me, and I continued with it. My CPA was athletics. I started going there regularly for practice, but it became unmanageable to go for practice for almost 2 hours and come back tired. I decided to drop the idea of going there regularly.",
      "Then came the SnT clubs and teams recruitments. The SnT teams looked fancy to me as a fresher, and I wanted to join one. I gave the test and interview for one team but couldn‚Äôt get into that. Then the only option left with me was the Aero-modelling club. I attended their workshops and then gave an interview for a winter project which I passed. Then I gave their secretary interviews and got selected.",
      "Meanwhile, I got into the Aerial Robotics team. It was exciting because I always wanted to join a SnT team, and I got the chance here. I tried my level best to do good there. I was always on time and spent the whole summer term on the team. I even left the Aero-modelling summer project for the team‚Äôs work. Eventually, I wasn‚Äôt given the secretary post in the Aero-modelling club. Even after giving so much to the team, I wasn‚Äôt enjoying what I was doing there. I couldn‚Äôt mingle with them. One of the reasons was my late joining. Still, that can‚Äôt be a reason big enough not to feel cherished about a task you genuinely wanted to do. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt learn anything there, but the things I learned were much less than the time I gave to the team. Eventually, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt worth it, and as the time passed, I became disconnected. I never told them I was leaving, but I left silently.",
      "I didn‚Äôt fill the secretary nominations for Hindi Sahitya Sabha because I thought it would become unmanageable along with the Aerial Robotics and Aero-modelling club. But as I mentioned earlier, I left the two after the summer term. So I entered my 2nd year leaving everything behind that I did in my 1st year. I had no plans and nothing in my hand to carry forward apart from academics.",
      "Then came SPO‚Äôs company coordinator‚Äôs nominations. I filled out that form, prepared a few things for the interview, and joined the placement office. After that, I felt a little satisfied. I enjoyed the work there and liked the company of the people there. I could easily manage it with my academics. Later on, I also became Assistant Placement Coordinator in my third year. I got the guidance of seniors there for almost everything I needed. They were there in my ups and downs (mainly in the downs) to guide me till the end. I am very grateful to each of them for everything they have done for me. Sadly I couldn‚Äôt meet them personally later due to COVID.",
      "Coming back to my 2nd-year things, I started searching for projects under the guidance of professors. I got three projects for my 2nd-year summer term. But I did two of them. Meanwhile, Covid came, and we were all locked in our houses. I did a little preparation for the internship season; as I said, it was just a little. Not enough to get me an internship through SPO. I did the projects well and spent most of the time on them. I made a good resume but lacked other skills needed for internship tests and interviews.",
      "My third year started with the internship season at the door. I was in SPO, so I also had their work. Along with that, I was also worried about my internship. I was not shortlisted for interviews in any company on Day1. Then later, a few shortlists came, but I couldn‚Äôt pass the interviews. I didn‚Äôt know what was going on in my academics. Thanks to my department homies who rescued me there in the online semester. During those online semesters, I became friends with many people from my department and touchwood, we share a very strong bond.",
      "I was apprehensive and disheartened because I couldn‚Äôt get an internship through SPO. I had a fear in my mind about what if this gets repeated in the placement season. Many depressing thoughts came to my mind, including how I would face myself if I couldn‚Äôt get anything out of IITK, which has provided a sack full of opportunities, and I couldn‚Äôt take the benefits. Instead of remaining in this sad zone, I prepared well for the placements. I started my placement preparation after mid sems of my 6th semester (around the last week of March). Yeah, I know it‚Äôs pretty early according to some people, but for me, it was beneficial. Then in April, I came across an internship opportunity, gave the interview, and cracked it. Finally, I had an internship in my hand. It sorted my summers. I decided just to do the internship and prepare well for the placements leaving other things for later.",
      "After all the hard work, I was able to get placed on Day 1 at Zomato as a Product Engineer.",
      "I was more grateful than happy. I had people who were indeed a blessing in my life. They created a positive and helpful environment and guided me toward success. My people were standing beside me all that time even though they had to leave their things for mine.",
      "After the placements, came the most memorable phase of the entire four years. Those parties, outings, bulla sessions, midnight walks, OAT vibes, photos, farewell and what not. It was the most beautiful time of my life, which will always remain in my memories. I hope I can relive it once again. Here are a few lines to all my near and dear ones at IITK ‚Äì",

      "I have read ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù for a couple of years. Interesting stories have come up every year, which inspired me to jot down my four years at IIT Kanpur. Honestly, this is hard; one might sit for hours and come up with nothing. For me, I went back down memory lane and started reminiscing. As soon as nostalgia kicked in, I started writing. Well, these ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù stories have a common notion of being a ‚ÄúRoller-Coaster Ride‚Äù or ‚Äústruggles to get a decent career prospect‚Äù. For me, it was more about the experiences, the people, and the culture. Undoubtedly, these were the best four years of my life. But on the flip side, they were also chaotic, challenging and complicated. So grab a cookie, and sit tight.",
      "Let‚Äôs start with the orientation. My SG (we still call him ‚ÄúBaapu‚Äù), Debashish Reang is from Tripura. I mistook him for my roommate when I first met him in Hall-13. Well, you can‚Äôt blame me. He does look the part. Orientation was one of these four years‚Äô most unforgettable and thrilling times. I still remember dancing to ‚ÄúOh Ho Ho Ho‚Äù on the auditorium stage with my schoolmate from Jaipur, Chinmay Goyal and yelling ‚ÄúBlue film o-o‚Äù from time to time. I was so amused by that week that I wanted to go through it again (a spoiler for later). The first thing I went to see on campus was the swimming pool. I had learnt to swim when I was ten years old, continued to swim until the 10th standard and then could not. The swimming pool was ‚Äúlove at first sight‚Äù I successfully got it as a CPA (the only sport I am good at). I still feel that those 40-50 minutes I spent in the pool were soothing and peaceful. It helped me maintain my calm and composure throughout the first year of my college life.Our wing SGs encouraged us to explore campus life as much as possible, yet they mentioned the importance of academics. The first semester officially began. I wanted to participate with the freshers, so I participated in the Dram Eve-1‚Äôs Nukkad Natak. The rehearsal started at around 8 PM and went on for hours. Initially, I gave it a lot of effort and practice, and I was considered for and given a few roles. But then reality struck hard, I had my first quiz (PHY-102), and I could not even understand the question, despite studying for a couple of days. Right around this time, I started missing the rehearsals of Dram Eve-1 and devoting a little more time to academics. I could see Newton‚Äôs third law play out in from me,",
      "All my roles were cut and assigned to other participants. There were days when I had no dialogues in the entire run-through. I used to feel that the mentors had some personal vendetta against me. But once the play took place, they threw a party, blowing away all my grudges.",
      "Midsems came and ended soon after. The happiness of their ending exceeded the frustration of underperforming. During the second half of the semester, I started working in the TOSC team. For those who don‚Äôt know what TOSC is, it is the ‚ÄúTechnothlon‚Äù of IITK conducted by the team Of Techkriti. Some of my friends and I had to conduct TOSC in Jaipur. We went to many schools and coachings and could gather some participation. However, the admission test of a well-renowned institution fell on the same date; thus, our candidate pool fell well short, and we cancelled the exam. When we got back on campus, expecting humiliation, we were surprised by the sheer maturity and support shown by the seniors. Maybe, they knew that we had tried our level best. The next thing we know is another success party.",
      "When I got EE at IITK, I was more than happy. Dreaming about changing your branch is trivial stuff. My parents‚Äô expectations were a bit high, but this did not bother me much. I think you should take in the pressure and let it motivate you rather than crush you. I was not too optimistic about my grades after the semester ended, and thus I could not change my branch. Looking back, I feel that your hard work shapes your journey in this college. Not being from ‚Äúa more desired branch‚Äù does not restrict your chances of achieving greatness. In IITK, everyone shapes their journey. I started thinking about my career plans in the second semester. I got an ML-related project in ESC-101. However, this semester‚Äôs workload forced me to take a break(which was quite long) from extracurriculars. I started focusing more on my academia right at this point. I think that you don‚Äôt need to attend every lecture and tutorial to get a good grade. It‚Äôs about smart work, and knowing the ‚Äúfundas‚Äù (hacks in simple language) for each course is sufficient. The second semester was a bit lighter. I had no academic commitments on Thursdays. But this made me lazy, and I started missing classes, especially after the midterms. I used to work on the project throughout the day and then sleep late at night. This had a drastic impact on both my mental and physical health. I spent a lot of my time in my wing. Thus I took the time to interact more with my wingies and develop deeper connections. We started playing PUBG together and had a lot of bulla sessions. The discussions contained everything from ‚Äústart-up ideas‚Äù to ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù. Listening to each other‚Äôs opinions did help in bursting the bubble of ignorance.",
      "I fell ill during the endsems, and the situation was so grave that I had breathing problems during the PHY103 endsem and had to leave half of the paper. I mustered the courage to give the last exam (ESC101), as I did not want to give the makeup(seniors used to say that makeup is way more difficult than endsems). I was able to survive the horrors of this semester (talk to any senior about PHY103 and MTH102) and was preparing for my summer plans to unfold.",
      "The summers are the best time to learn something new at IITK. You can improve your skills, knowledge and even grades. However, summers are harsh as well. You can‚Äôt survive without a room cooler. Luckily enough, as Vadi sir quoted, ‚ÄúYou get to be in the pool 4 hours a day, while the other teams have to practice in the scorching heat‚Äù the aquatics summer camp did help in coping with the heat. Soon, I came to know that I had become an SG. It was a new beginning. I was as scared as I was enthralled. You are responsible for directing the college life of 5-to 6 students who you have not met once. When I met my bacchas for the first time in Hall-13, they were as clueless as I was(on my first day of college) about their college life. They eased into it as the orientation continued, and I got to cherish another orientation.",
      "A lot of emphasis is placed on getting PORs to improve your resume‚Äôs aesthetics. The important thing is the experience and the learnings you get by working at that position and how you can utilise that to benefit your personal and professional life. The most substantial POR I had, until the last sem, was managing the finances of Udghosh‚Äô 19. We were assigned a task to sell the official merchandise in all the hostels, and can you guess how many did we sell?The answer is ‚ÄúONE‚Äù. Somehow, I convinced one of my wingies to buy it. But the fest got washed by rain, and thus all the plans had to be cancelled. The next offline/in-person Udghosh would not occur until April 2022 (see if you can connect some dots).",
      "In the second year, I was baffled by the academic load of my branch. I could not manage the extra-curricular. I had to leave swimming, and I started to focus more on my studies. On the positive side, my CPI increased drastically in the second year.¬† When covid stuck, I did not know that my college life would essentially be halved. I had hoped that it was a temporary situation(analogous to swine flu) and that things would get better in a month or two. But as the lockdown extended, I started missing the freedom of the campus and felt trapped. It soon dawned upon me that internship season was about to come. I started preparing mid-July, with less than a month left in the tests. The only skills I improved during those summers were my PUBG skills.",
      "I was underprepared and overconfident during the internship season, signs of an oncoming tragedy. On Day 1, I could only crack two interviews and could not clear more than a couple of rounds in both. The 5th semester had already started, and frustration and anxiety began to kick in. As more and more of my batchmates were getting offers, these feelings intensified. I had long conversations with Utkarsh Gupta, where we both used to condole and motivate each other. In the next week, I faltered on two more tests and one group discussion. Then came the company I had the most hopes to get into. Adobe had its test scheduled on Wednesday, right after the test of Gartner. If I did not clear any of these tests, I would not have any interviews until the weekend. So, taking a considerable risk, I left Gartner‚Äôs test and gave my all to Adobe‚Äôs test. Their interviews were scheduled on Saturday, and they had not released an interview shortlist by Friday midnight. I was a bit sceptical by this point, but at 4 AM on Saturday, I saw the list with my name on it. I took a proper nap and prepared myself for the 1-hour interview. I felt positive after giving the interview, and rather than getting my hopes up; I started watching a movie. Amidst the film, I received a phone call from Utkarsh mentioning someone receiving an offer from Adobe. I tried to log in to the internship portal but could not (since it deactivates after you get an offer). I fell off the bed, and tears rolled into my eyes.",
      "I feel that internships and placements are a time of stress, qualm and self-doubt. Getting through it is not an easy task. It is essential to maintain calm and composure and, rather than feeling jealous, learn to appreciate others‚Äô achievements. During the online semesters, I took a heavy course load(>60 credits) in all the semesters. I chose the courses where the workload was not too much, and there were enough new things to learn. A significant achievement during this time was to get my first ‚Äúdassa‚Äù during the fifth semester. Another interesting series of events happened during the end of the 6th semester. The situation was grim and horrifying with the onslaught that the second covid wave brought. I lost some of my loved ones and was not in the right state of my mind to give the endsems. This was also the situation of many of my friends(batchmates). However, I was surprised by the kindness and considerate actions of the profs to relax the endsems; some even cancelled the endsems (there were some exceptions, obviously).",
      "After the semester, my internship did help me in coping with the stress of the 2nd wave. I also got a little taste of the corporate world. But the best thing this intern gave me were some new friends, people from my batch I did not know before, Priyanshu, Muskan and Vishesh. I could not sit for on-campus placements as I had accepted a PPO from Adobe. I had mixed feelings about this decision. The placements are a tough time. There are 2-3 tests scheduled each day before the endsems, so you don‚Äôt have time to relax properly. It takes a heavy mental toll. I tried to encourage and assist in preparing some of my friends sitting in the placements. The placements were a huge success. My close friends got placed in decent companies, which motivated me to search for better job opportunities off-campus. I started my off-campus hunt on LinkedIn. After about a month of tests, interviews and salary negotiation, I finally got an offer from Zomato, which I accepted.",
      "This brings me to the last chapter of my story, the final sem. It was an extraordinary denouement to my four years at IITK. I met all my friends (including those I made during the lockdown). I wanted to spend as much time with them as possible. I went to the mess with my wingies, had long walks with a different person each day and enjoyed the view our serene and beautiful campus had to offer. The days ended with playing cards while listening to AP Dhillon‚Äôs and Diljit Dosanjh‚Äôs music. My Spotify playlist improved drastically in these four months.",
      "As you might have guessed, I also got to be a part of the core team of Udghosh‚Äô 21 as head security. The role did not require too much commitment, but I got to see the hard work and the dedication put into the conduction of a fest. We were able to conduct a pronite as well while having a tight budget. I appreciate the efforts of my fellow heads as the security work mostly went smoothly. Participating in a fest, especially in the more active cells, does help you improve your managerial and decision-making skills.",
      "Looking back at my college life, there were a lot of missouts and things I could have done differently. But, the friends and the memories I made here are worth a lifetime. The struggles and challenges helped me learn to look at things practically rather than subjectively. It makes me delighted, blissful and a bit emotional to graduate from this esteemed institution.",

All right, enough of this crappy wannabe mini pep talk. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase.",
      "I came to campus on the sunny and incredibly humid afternoon of July 20th, 2018. Being a pampered kid, I had no idea what the hell of a ride I was in for. The orientation week was rejuvenating after two monotonous and lifeless years of JEE preparation. As promised by our wing baapus, they were indeed one of the best days in our college life (though I will never forgive CS for not conducting the HR Kadim story for my group). However, the fun was short-lived. On the second day of classes, I fell while riding the bicycle and somehow fractured my left wrist. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, like how the hell is that even possible, but anyway, it happened. That was the beginning of a lot of things going wrong. When everyone was busy exploring clubs and interacting with new people, I used to sit in my room most of the time doing nothing at all. I still remember missing the auditions of the music club for freshers‚Äô night due to this, something that I had dreamt of for years. When entire wings used to be out for AM classes and CC/NCL visits for ESC lab preparations, I just cried on my fate. This vicious state of seclusion slowly started harming my academics, bit by bit. I did feel that I was missing out on a lot, but it never occurred to me that this would be affecting my acads so severely. When the results of the very first MTH101 quiz came, the damage was heavy and very evident. I spent the rest of the first semester trying to play catchup with acads, never being able to figure it out. At this point, it may look like the scene was very gloomy, but trust me, that was not the case! I spent my time watching movies, having bulla sessions with friends, which frequently turned into night-outs, enjoying fests and participating in events without care. I even got rid of my earlier FOMO by performing in my department‚Äôs freshers‚Äô night andOdyssey,my hall (12) ‚Äòs intra-hall cult competition for freshers.",
      "The result- I had my first backlog after the end of the first sem. I was never the one who had dreams of a branch change or maintaining a high CPI before coming to college. This ‚Äúchill hai‚Äù attitude helped me avoid depression. Still, it did not do much for my miserable way of handling my freedom on campus. The following semester, things did not change much except that more of my friends gave up on acads and were now sailing on the same boat. As sadist as it sounds, It was relieving to know that you‚Äôre not alone! That booked the ticket for my first and last summer stay at the campus. Summers were arguably the best time I spent on campus during the entire four years. The workload was less, and you could involve yourself with activities which allowed you to recover after the torturing lectures of the day ‚Äì pubg sessions for the win. This difference from a regular semester made me realise that some of us struggle due to the sheer madness and the unreal pressure of doing everything, everywhere, all the time in freshman year.",
      "Enter the second year. Having done well academically in the summer term, I felt I should indulge in fests/clubs, especially after missing out in the first year ‚Äì a thought that occurs to the most junta in every batch. As it turned out, I overcompensated by holding 4 PORs in 3 fests at a time! I thoroughly enjoyed working in Udghosh that year. Interacting with seniors in hall-1 during the time was an experience I will cherish. I made new friends, some of whom went on to form the support group that I would need badly in the challenging days ahead. I also worked with SPO during the winters as a company coordinator for the placement season, which was another great learning experience.",
      "Alas, when everything seemed to look merry, I flunked another course. This time a core course for my department. But something felt different now. I was mature enough to realise that I had messed up unnecessarily this time, giving complete disregard to academics again. I genuinely thought it was my fault and had my first brush with depression. After a month of opening up and discussing my issues with some close people and working on them, I returned for my 4th sem. The plan was simple ‚Äì get all focus on the courses this sem and prepare for the fast-approaching intern season. This also meant giving up on all non-academic responsibilities. Frankly, I can‚Äôt say it was the best decision then, but it did seem to work. Midsem results revealed that I had done reasonably well in all courses, particularly in the one I was repeating, which gave me a lot of self-confidence. I would end up getting an A in that course this time. The feeling of finally being back on track, as it appeared, was comforting, to say the least. And that, of course, is when covid struck.",
      "The semester result revealed that I had scored my best SPI ever(and that would remain the case till the end). The sole focus was on intern prep ‚Äì mainly consisting of competitive programming, which had been a big thing in my wing since my first year. Still, I had always swayed away from it. Slowly and gradually, the initial enthu of giving contests, practising questions and completing Coursera specialisations gifted to us by the institute faded away. Spending entire days scrolling social media, making goofy memes on my Redmi note 5 and bingeing stuff became the new norm. In addition to this, the first online semester started. In a desperate attempt to replicate the academic vigour of an offline semester, the administration introduced means of continuous evaluation, which was a disaster, in my opinion. My entire week was flooded with assignments, presentations, quizzes, and instructors trying to complete the whole coursework in a much smaller semester. My below seven CPI and not-so-great coding skills (or any relevant skills for that matter) ensured that I did not get any intern offer. All this chaos was distressing. It felt like being back to square one. Consecutively, I decided to keep my 6th sem relatively free. I did not take any challenging CSE courses in the hope of projects, mainly due to the fear of losing out further on my CPI.",
      "In the summer that followed, when most of my friends were engaged with internships they had landed, I was cold emailing professors whose work was remotely related to ML/DL as it interested me then. I must have written around 50+ emails to profs across departments and, in some cases, across institutes. No prizes for guessing, the majority of them did not reply. If any of them did, it was generally on the lines of a cold-hearted ‚Äúsorry‚Äù. Somehow, I connected with two profs from the IME department and was lucky enough to get projects under them. I tried to go back to coding again, which didn‚Äôt make much of a difference, but peer pressure gets you there.",
      "It was August, and the start of the penultimate semester called for switching priorities again. I minimised my coursework and emphasised preparing for the placement season. After discussing whether we were made for coding and whether a coding role was made for us with some friends who were equally and, in some cases, even more uninterested than me in coding, I decided to prepare for other profiles as well. The entire process was exhausting, from resume preparation to giving 4-5 tests daily, sometimes back to back. But the thing that would take its toll on everyone was the interview process that was yet to begin. I wouldn‚Äôt bore you with the details of how many times I got rejected, how many rounds I had to give and so on. I had two offers from decent companies in my bag on the same day, and I was content with them. Not having friends around on that day with whom you had done everything for the last three years was a bit stingy, but we made up for it by going on a long-awaited wing trip. To see those happy faces again, with the same energy as with which we came to campus for the first time, was a moment of immense satisfaction.",
      "I could not return to campus early due to being sick of covid and later due to the admin‚Äôs closing of entry into the campus. But when we finally reached IITK again, life became as we intended it to be. After almost four long, arduous years of ‚Äúengineering‚Äù, it was finally the time to party. This is the time that you long for when you get in. Trying out any substances that you could get your hands on, lurking in the academic area at 3 am for absolutely no reason at all, trying Maggi in every canteen on the campus, realising that they change the name everywhere, doing that circle waala dance for one last time in the final Antaragni pronite after which you stand quietly and gaze at the big screen trying to relive everything that you went through for one last time. The trip is for real.",
      "If I say now that these four years were the happiest years of my life that I would cherish for life, and it was all merry, I couldn‚Äôt be lying more. And I see no reason as to why that is necessary. Perhaps the correct adjective here would be impactful. What you learn here will transform you into a better version of yourself who understands how much of what you do and think about its worth. You find friends who had you in the first half, only to realise that life changes people and you are not as lucky as you thought. At the same time, you meet friends who cry and laugh at the same things as you, sometimes at you. Some of them will be with you until the very end, and you will know they are for life.The quote that comes to my mind here is:",
      "Living your life precisely like it was by someone else does not guarantee you being in their place after all. Neither does not doing it that way mean you would never ‚Äúmake it‚Äù. It is about trusting your gut that eventually, everything will work out, one way or another. It is about connecting those dots from Steve Jobs‚Äôs famous speech at Stanford. You can never connect the dots looking forward. That is to say; you can‚Äôt live your years at IITK carefully planning out everything as if it were an algorithm and despair if that doesn‚Äôt happen. You can only connect them looking backwards after being there, doing everything you had to do and sitting with a cup of coffee to pen down your ‚ÄòAs We Leave‚Äô.",

      "Well yeah, starting an AWL itself seemed like a difficult task for me. It‚Äôs tough to pen down those innumerable experiences you have had in 4 years. At this point, I find writing technical paper drafts much easier than an AWL draft. Being involved in research, I tend to read between the lines and with some effort in doing that for the AWL of my seniors, I could interpolate a bit, and here we are. As an abstract, the title ‚Äúcrossovers‚Äù could be a technical jargon for a basketball move, it could be a switch in your interests, or it just could be some random word which popped up in my mind when I sat down to write this draft. Well, keep on reading, you‚Äôll know what it means. I know this draft would be incomplete without the experiences that paved the path to the one I‚Äôm on. Still, as I sit down, there is a vast lot, some of which are on top of my head at the moment, some of which I can remember vividly, and others have faded into the distant horizons of my memory. But anyway, I‚Äôll pen down the ones that are on top of my head at the moment.",
      "The first year is hands down the best time you‚Äôll have on campus. From the orientation when you meet entirely new people to the end of your second semester, make sure you have loads of fun and memories. I won‚Äôt tell you exactly what to do, I‚Äôm sure you will figure out your way of having fun, and that‚Äôs the good part, we tend to do things differently. That being aside, I can maybe polarise myself a bit towards academics. I know PHY 103 will be a pain for most of you, and you‚Äôll complain that the absolute grading in MTH 102 and TA 101 isn‚Äôt meant for most (at least it wasn‚Äôt for me). That‚Äôs alright, we‚Äôve been through the same, but the good thing is there are your friends to help you out, highly educated and established profs to clear your doubts. Most of us tend to have certain perceptions about professors; maybe we judge them based on how they grade, but trust me, give the professor‚Äôs office a visit before you judge. I‚Äôm sure your perceptions would change. As a personal note, I was passionate about Maths in my first year and used to talk with our MTH 102 instructor frequently. So once, when I didn‚Äôt have my Identity card on the day of MTH 102 quiz II (nor did I check which section I belonged to and ended up in L18 instead of L19) and Prof. Arvind Lal refused to take my attendance, the MTH 102 instructor turned up with ‚ÄúHey Spandan, it‚Äôs all right!! Just relax and give your test, I‚Äôll take care of the rest‚Äù. Prof Arvind probably took me for a careless brat, but when we met at the tea party of inter-IIT sports felicitation, he tapped me on my shoulder, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the guy whom I refused to take attendance a few days back? Hi, I‚Äôm Arvind‚Äù. I was slightly surprised, but we had an excellent informal conversation that day. Profs can be as good as your friends sometimes :P. Prof Arvind is no more, but I‚Äôm glad I shared such a fond memory with him.",
      "I was at the tea party not because I was a part of the Inter IIT contingent but because I used to play basketball on a serious note and had practice sessions daily, and our seniors invited us all. At that point, when people from all four years were together on the court, you could see some hierarchy in the sense senior players would be playing matches, and the freshies and sophies would be put aside doing crossovers and handles. I guess that‚Äôs how it goes. When I was in the court a few days before leaving, I couldn‚Äôt see the same hierarchy anymore. Unusual timelines of Y21 owing to COVID ruined it partially. If ever I had a BT about anything, my roommate Sachin is probably the most chilled-out guy I‚Äôve ever met. You can‚Äôt just stop laughing after having a conversation with him. Things slowly started becoming a routine: basketball, bakchodi with wingies, late-night canteen visits, and night outs (which force you to miss classes) when the only full-fledged year we were on campus ended.",
      "During the summer, I was involved in the Basketball Summer Camp and undertook a Bayesian ML project that Aniket and Yatin offered. Aniket is a damn dedicated and helpful senior, more like a friend to me and has been my next-to-reach-out guy whenever I face academic issues. Towards the end of summer, there was the Orientation Process and being a Student Guide, I got to relive the experience once again. I‚Äôll never forget how we lure the ‚Äúbacchas‚Äù with the self-cooked HR Kadim Story. During my second year, I found people more considerate about academics. I undertook a few more ML projects with a friend Avinandan to explore the subject more deeply. The CS coursework tends to become somewhat rigorous towards the 4th semester, which is partly one of the reasons I became irregular in Basketball practice sessions. Avinandan and I were busy applying for ML interns for the upcoming summer.",
      "I did land an internship at the University of Oregon, Eugene, but thanks to COVID, travel regulations were strict, and I couldn‚Äôt travel to the US. Well talking of COVID, the short 2-week midsem break turned out to be a long 1.5 yr break from campus. Those years we spent away from campus, friends and studying in a dull online setting were undoubtedly challenging. Still, we went through it, and I‚Äôm sure it came up as a learning experience to go through several such hardships in the upcoming stages of our lives. To compensate for the UO internship, I undertook a project on Graph Representation Learning. The subject was new for me, and despite numerous attempts, we couldn‚Äôt make much progress. Eventually, the professor called off the project with the excuse of GRL being a stagnant and challenging area to contribute to in ML. My confidence in research had reached a local minimum around this time, and I was starting to get the vibes of ‚Äúwell, maybe ML research just isn‚Äôt the thing‚Äù. I decided to take a break and explore industry-level ML. Thankfully my internship at Microsoft IDC the next summer gave me the chance to do so.",
      "Oh wait, how did I forget the third year in between. After all, for a CS undergrad, it‚Äôs the year which decides whether you‚Äôre the one who is going to have the next breakthrough in CS, isn‚Äôt it?. Arguably the most stressful one and yet the most fruitful year, you‚Äôll get to evaluate your real interests in the subject. The continuous evaluation induced a bit of extra stress due to the online setting. Thankfully ‚ÄúValorant‚Äù came as a good way of being in touch with your friends regularly. I miss the five stack queues I used to have with my wingies. That being aside, the ML courses kept me sticking to the field for some more time. Although my experience as an intern at Microsoft was incredible, I didn‚Äôt get the urge to pursue industry as I found the routine I followed as an intern mundane and the work redundant/trivial.",
      "Around the 7th semester, I decided to let go of ML and start exploring something different. Thankfully for me, there wasn‚Äôt any Placement pressure due to the Microsoft PPO. I was occupied with a theory project for an advanced convex optimisation course I undertook that semester. I had explored the field apriori but took this course as a good way of evaluating my interests, given that I had decided to let go of ML. In the final presentation of the same, our work seemed quite impressive to the instructor, and he persuaded us to get the work published. Deep down, I wanted to pursue math-intensive theory, and optimisation was the perfect fit.",
      "During Jan ‚Äô22, when we were all called back, we spent the initial days in isolation owing to the third wave of COVID. I caught COVID for a second time. Combined with relationship issues I had at the same time and a wholly fucked up timetable owing to paperwork, my health got affected seriously. I started getting anxiety attacks. I hardly believe there is any Hospital in Kanpur where I haven‚Äôt been in the HC Ambulance with Utkarsh / Harshit. My friends Utkarsh, Harshit, and Shivam were the ones I could hit up any time during the day, and they would be ready to help me out. I‚Äôm thankful for such awesome friends who stand by your side during tough times.",
      "I took a good one-month break around Mid-February from campus to get back to having a healthy life. When I was back in March, there was a month left, and everyone was back on campus. You could see the joy in students, meeting their fellow friends after a long break of 2 years. Enjoying these few days was probably the only thing any graduating student was concerned about. I was least concerned about my work; it was just making the most of your last few days. People have ways of having fun (if you get what I mean :P) and reiterating the important part about life, and we tend to do things differently. We mostly spent time strolling across the streets of IITK or doing random shit in Yuvraj‚Äôs room or just going on late-night movie shows. And well, there were these photoshoots that made you formally realise that you‚Äôre graduating xD. As we approached the final days and everything associated with the campus had a ‚Äúlast‚Äù term ahead of it, things became harder. The last time I visited Hall 13 a few days before leaving, I felt envious of the freshies for the first time. First-year is the only full-fledged year we spent on campus, and there‚Äôs a lot associated with it. While some of your friends bid happy goodbyes, you could see gloomy faces and teary eyes for some others. But eventually, all good things come to an end, and a good ending had an incredible journey.",
      "Well, it‚Äôs been long, and I am grateful if you‚Äôve been to this point. As some of you would have figured, my journey in these four years has been quite non-convex. There have been local minima and maxima. However, the good thing about minima‚Äôs is there‚Äôs always growth around them. Just take these four years to develop and grow yourself as an individual. You‚Äôre no longer in competition with the one million candidates; these four years are meant for you to pave a path for your own. Explore everything within your reach before you converge on something. It‚Äôs never too late. If you couldn‚Äôt find your interests in these four years, chill; there‚Äôs a lot ahead. Rather than just ‚Äúgoing through these years‚Äù of college, try ‚Äúgrowing through these years‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure the global maxima will be pretty high for you :).",

      "I always thought that Vox chose the candidates who would write the ‚Äúas we leave‚Äù articles, and I was sure I won‚Äôt be the one to be picked for this. But it seems like that ain‚Äôt the case, so let‚Äôs go üôÇ",
      "",
      "Most people reading this article might not know me or might not have interacted with me. I have always been an average person, one who doesn‚Äôt enjoy the limelight much, I‚Äôve always liked keeping a low profile. And being the introvert that I am, I believe I didn‚Äôt connect with many people on campus, but with whomever I did, I‚Äôm truly grateful to them for being a part of my journey.",
      "",
      "As I said, I entered IITK as an introverted girl who wanted to explore every bit of the campus and notions of campus life, unaware of the vast experiences one can have here. I knew I was entering a new place away from home for the first time, that I would have to interact with new people and all, but the IITK culture of behens and ammas and bapus made this a bit easier for me. Right from the start, it gave me those 6 people (Ritika Ajmera, Sonali Gupta, Ipsita Mohanty, Shreshtha Agarwal, Nidhi Hegde, Shivangi Singh) I knew on the campus. Now I just had to expand my circle a bit, and through different club activities such as the treasure hunt, I was able to do so. I participated in many clubs initially but then didn‚Äôt continue for some reason or the other. This might be one thing that I have missed, being associated with a club throughout the four years at IITK. I was always more inclined towards acads. As has been the dream of most of the freshers, I also wanted a branch change to CSE at the start, but it was rather challenging to get a single dassa üôÇ So yes, I did complete my B-Tech in Chemical Engineering. The first year was all about becoming a part of IITK culture, absorbing different bits of it, making friends, learning that ‚Äòmaths‚Äô and ‚Äòmth101 & 102‚Äô are worlds apart, being introduced to Mr. C, missing the Local Train concert, and becoming a part of the Techkriti team.",
      "Then came the first and the only summers that I spent at IITK. Now that I look back at it, those were the only summers that I spent on campus, I‚Äôm more than glad that I did! I took up a project with Somu and a course hoping to have a productive summer. I also planned on taking up swimming. Summers indeed turned out to be great.. sleepless nights, all-nighters, night outs, RM and CCD discussion sessions, and the Banaras trip. The project went on to continue in the next semester as well. Shubham was our mentor‚Äì the coolest and the best we could ever get. Apart from some technicalities, what more I learned through that project was how to manage time and resources and make the most out of them. In that semester, I also joined SPO as a company coordinator, which I suppose was one of the most wonderful experiences at IITK. It gave me a first-hand experience of the offline internship and placement drive. The moments when everyone is eagerly waiting outside the interview rooms for their friend, all tensed up as to what will happen, and then the tears of joy, that placement hugs after he/she got the offer, that vibe it was all just mesmerizing and spellbinding. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see myself in their shoes with my friends and live those moments for myself.",
      "The fourth semester started with me attending the CODS COMAD conference to present the project we had been working on since the first-year summer. I missed the starting few days of classes and went to Hyderabad, all dressed up in formals for the first time, filled with stage fright, with butterflies in my stomach, ready for the presentation. That was a really delightful experience. Somu and I were able to attract the attention of quite an audience. That was my first experience with public speaking, and I was pretty happy with the job!",
      "Then back on campus, I struggled a bit to cope with the acads, midsems came on, and then the 7 days of midsem break, which extended indefinitely, marking the end of the 2nd year, all thanks to covid! Soon we landed in 3rd year with the internship drive in front of us. I had prepped really hard for the intern season ‚Äì back a good internship and then aim for a PPO, that was the plan. Given the situation at hand, Covid meant staying indoors at all times, online sem led to losing contact with many people, unlike what we used to have back on campus. I was now talking to only 3 people from campus, Somu, Sonali, and Sumit. I was in constant contact with these 3 people, we prepped together, shared our BT,¬† and in the end, apart from my family, they were the ones who were more than excited when I got the internship at JPMC.",
      "‚ÄúWhatever you do in this life, it‚Äôs not legendary, unless your friends are there to see it.‚Äù",
      "I must admit I‚Äôve found some great friends at IITK and will always be grateful to IITK for it. The two online semesters were a pretty different experience. It was tough to stay motivated and be there for people. Mental health did take a resounding hit for everyone. Lost contact with a few, but stuck by the ones who mattered. I may have a very small circle, but they were always there in all the ups and downs. Irrespective of what happened, we always picked up where we left.",
      "Something that I learned in my second year and yet again in the third and fourth year is that things don‚Äôt work out the way you thought they would most of the time. Whatever may happen, you don‚Äôt have to stop. Life still does go on. The ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù cliche is, in fact, true. If things aren‚Äôt going your way, then take a step forward, don‚Äôt stop right there. Stand up for yourself because, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just you who‚Äôll be most affected by your decisions. You just have to keep moving forward. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt grow when things are easy, we grow when things get difficult.‚Äù Another thing, ‚Äúvibe‚Äù is really important. The people who you spend most of your time with play a great role in shaping your journey. Surround yourself with people whom you get positive vibes from. Keep a positive vibe yourself, after all how you make the people around you feel matters too. With the right people around, you‚Äôll get through whatever comes your way.",
      "The fourth year started with the dilemma of whether we‚Äôll ever get to live the campus life or it‚Äôs just ‚Äúdegree.pdf‚Äù now. With the placement season coming up too, I was waiting for the PPO results to be declared, coz as planned, I won‚Äôt be sitting for placements then, and I hadn‚Äôt prepared for the placements. While everyone was giving coding contests, practicing for GDs, etc., I felt intimidated that I hadn‚Äôt even started anything, and that I was far behind the rest of the lot. So I started the prep, and in a day or two, the PPO results were out, and yeah, I got it! It was a big day for me. Everything fell in the right place for the first time. And this time too all my friends were more than excited, after all, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt win alone. That‚Äôs just how it is.‚Äù Soon, we, the graduating batch, were called back to the campus. The placement season was going on, and with the sem continuing in online mode, all my friends sat for the placement drive. I was glad for what I had once wished to witness in my second year and lost all hopes for it due to covid; I was going to live that. I was there with each one of my friends at their big moment. I remember being up for 3 days straight till everyone‚Äì Somu, Sonali, Sumit, was placed; those 3 days felt like an eternity. So much stress, tension, excitement, and those feelings of ups and downs, I can only imagine the state of those who actually sat in the placement drive. I was so very tensed up and excited that I just could not sleep. To give you an instance, on Day1, Somu had an interview; I stayed up all night waiting for the call for the results, hoping that everything should go well; and as soon as he got the offer, he came to GH to break the news to me all excited. That was a different feeling altogether when you are so so excited for someone else that you are literally just jumping and dancing around lol. The placement drive added more people to my circle. I won‚Äôt be lying when I say that I‚Äôve met and bonded with more people in my last year, especially the placement drive and the last sem, than in the rest of the three years. Kohima, Ankit, and then Samyak, Milind, Anubhav.",
      "The last sem ‚Äì I was very excited about it; I had a bucket list of last sem things that I wanted to do before leaving ready in my mind. But not a single bit of it went according to the plan. The last sem was divided into two phases ‚Äì pre-midsem and post-midsem. In the first phase, I kind of secluded myself from everyone and spent all the time in my room ‚Äì social anxiety. It became so bad that I‚Äôd skip meals, I wouldn‚Äôt go to the mess or the canteen. This being the last sem didn‚Äôt have much load on acads side; I wasn‚Äôt involved in any project or internship or anything, so I didn‚Äôt have anything to do. I started reading books and started playing the uke more often. Sonali and Kohima came back to campus, they helped me step out again. They made sure that I went to the mess- at least one of them came with me. I started going for a run every evening, thanks to Samyak. I started going out again for random strolls in the academic area, the oat road, or the director‚Äôs bungalow road. Things got normal eventually.",
      "In the second phase, I joined the Udghosh team. I worked just for the last 15 days before the fest, but I never felt like I joined the team too late, not even once. It‚Äôs more than a team, a family, I would say. All the people were so welcoming; I got mixed up so easily. Hall-1, this place has so many memories associated with it ‚Äì we worked, enjoyed, laughed, and cried together. Udghosh gave me some new bonds and played an essential role in strengthening some older ones. The moments on the pronite stage, dancing, singing, smiling, crying, the proud moments that we finally did it, all of the hard work was totally worth it. It was a pleasure to be a part of the team, where everyone was working passionately towards one goal and not merely for a POR. On the individual level, I‚Äôd say I became more confident as a head, handling and managing the team under me, worked with Y19s, and Y20s, we sat together all day long making something, or discussing something, and some of them started recognizing me for who I am alone, and not as someone‚Äôs friend as used to be the case earlier. It was something everyone must experience at least once in the four years, being a part of the organizing team, you‚Äôll never forget it.",
      "Now that I‚Äôm finally writing this article, I‚Äôve left my hostel room ‚Äì empty and taken some 4-5 bags filled with memories back home with me. This place, the people, the campus, and the experiences I‚Äôve had have made me the person I am today. If I were ever supposed to go back in time, I might not want to change a single thing because I am happy with the person I‚Äôve become, and all the experiences that I‚Äôve had here play a significant role in it. It was a journey full of changes, some good, some bad, and it transformed me into the person I am today. As I leave, I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôd always miss the familiarity of this beautiful campus and that IITK, you‚Äôd always be the home I have away from home and the memories, love, comfort, and peace that you‚Äôve given me in your environment and the people I‚Äôve met because of you shall always remain unparalleled.",
      "Also, my story, this journal isn‚Äôt complete without thanking these important people whom I met right in the first year and who became such an important part of my life that I can‚Äôt imagine them not being a part of my life. Somu, Sumit, Sonali. And the people that I met along the way, Shubham, Ankit, Kohima, Shreyasi, Devansh, Samyak, Kshitiz, Milind, and Anubhav. And in the end, the Udghosh team‚Äì Mradul, Jasmine, Deepak, Pruthvi, Shivangi, Ankit, Sujay, Ashray, Ayush, Harsh, and Somu.",

      "Akanksha Biswal is a Y20 Master‚Äôs student from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering. In this edition, she recalls her journey leading her to IITK, the struggles the pandemic brought and her experience as a postgraduate student at the institute.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny how each day you wake up and never really know if it will be the one that will change your life forever.‚Äù ‚Äì The Secret World of Arrietty",
      "It is the most cliched story in the world ‚Äì you spend your life preparing for a moment, and then the moment comes and leaves, and it just feels so feeble. Almost like the storm arrives and you are sleeping, and when you wake up in the morning, it is gone, only the weather, a faint reminder of what had transpired. I‚Äôve imagined this for quite some time ‚Äì how I‚Äôd churn out this one story that captures my time at IITK and leaves behind no detail. And today, as I write this, I realise I am caught up trying to find a beginning. But when you sit a little longer with this thought, do you start to understand that nothing ever really begins, does it? One story is a story picked up amidst tonnes of interwoven stories. Who even knows where it started and where it‚Äôll end.",
      "This story that I‚Äôve picked up to tell you goes way back to the year 2018.I‚Äôd freshly gotten out of my undergraduate and was looking for opportunities to pursue a Masters. IIT Kanpur then had begun offering an MS in Cognitive Science. I remember coming to the campus for the interviews. I did not know what I was looking for. I did want to pursue further studies, but I wasn‚Äôt too sure what I could bring to the field.",
      "Nevertheless, I had come for the interview to gain experience and, in the process, learn some things. They‚Äôd scheduled my interview for the second day. I do not remember which lecture hall it was, but I followed some routes, made my way to the CCD here on campus, and then took a long route back to the hall I‚Äôd been allotted for my stay. My undergraduate college was located in this busy area of Delhi. Numerous colleges are scattered here and there along the roads. The hustle-bustle of Delhi traffic often drowned the excited cheers from within the colleges. Evenings, we‚Äôd spend in cafes and other street food joints. It felt like you had wings, but you could never stretch out your arms enough. IIT Kanpur‚Äôs campus was a stark contrast to it. On my way back to Hall 6, I remember standing in front of the basketball court adjacent to the athletics ground and telling myself:",
      "‚ÄúIf there were any place I‚Äôd like to be, it‚Äôd be this.‚Äù",
      "I did not make it through the interviews. As the years poured in one after the other, the IIT Kanpur dream kept getting buried. When in 2020, I‚Äôd sat for the GATE examination, I barely remembered this little wish I had made once upon a time. It was mostly an attempt at moral support for many of my friends applying for the examination, and I thought it would be good fun. I ended up making it through the examination with a decent rank. This was the time when the pandemic had freshly struck. We were swamped with online coursework, illness, anxieties, and an abrupt shift to a world devoid of physical touch altogether. I rarely got to myself those two minutes of peace to think about what I could do with my GATE score. The counselling had started late. Everything had been chaotic. But one day, I woke up in the morning and checked the choice locking page to see that I‚Äôd gotten IIT Kanpur in the first selection. I‚Äôd locked. BSBE. I hadn‚Äôt informed my parents or my friends. It was almost like I knew. That was my moment. This was the one story I‚Äôd been waiting for ‚Äì a dream that caught up to me when I was barely looking. Happiness that finds you suddenly like a faint breeze that floats in from underneath your door.",
      "I haven‚Äôt spent a year on the campus yet, so while I did have the strong urge to begin this with ‚Äúmy years in IIT Kanpur-‚Äú, I‚Äôll stop. My months at IIT Kanpur have reinstated my belief that there is more in the journey than the destination. I felt like a kid lost in a fair for the first month. However, because of my tryst with Japanese, I‚Äôd met some undergraduate folks in the online class, and a couple of us had stayed in touch. So, when on the second day, I searched for an ATM using Google Maps and landed in front of E-shop with nothing remotely close in sight, I had to call a friend from Japanese class. They guided me to the ATM while on the video call. Desperate times call for desperate measures! When I look back now, what felt like a giant maze that I‚Äôll probably never get around, now feels like a city I‚Äôd been in all my life. That is how most things in life are. The unfamiliarity is soon replaced with comfort. You learn to navigate better. It gets tough before it starts to get easy. And I know no person on earth can convince you of this, and you will fail too. But it helps to have this thought at the back of your mind for days that might seem a little too difficult than the others.",
      "Somedays, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve caught my feet on two boats. Am I the pandemic batch, or am I the post-pandemic batch? It‚Äôs like experiencing both worlds. We‚Äôve written our exams sitting in our homes for three hours with our cameras and mics on and having our parents call us out for dinner in the middle of it, and we‚Äôve also danced till we dropped at Antaragini! I remember there was a point during that month where I felt like Vicky Kaushal in the movie ‚ÄúMasaan‚Äù crying ‚Äúsaala ye fests kaahe khatam nahi hota be?‚Äù I know I‚Äôve gotten some mental daggers drawn. Still, it was overwhelming to be thrown from the mundane life you had thought will be the norm for quite some time to buzzing activity all over again. This, I feel, demands discussion. I always felt like the transition from a pandemic to a post-pandemic culture was never given its due. It is notorious ‚Äì every change. It wrecks your mental health. I felt like a fish out of water for a long time when I landed on the campus. Everyone was a stranger around me, and in all that hustle and bustle of faces, cliques, and canteens, I almost felt like I did not belong. I was living the dream I‚Äôd once had, and in that dream, everything wasn‚Äôt as rosy as I‚Äôd pictured it to be. Everything felt like it was stagnant, suspended in time. During the first couple of months on the campus, I faced some personal setbacks too. I was insanely lucky to have two very close friends who made me feel like I deserved a lot more fun in my life. And this is another big lesson I learned in college. That, often we forget the good in ourselves. Even though we‚Äôve internalised the idea that we should put ourselves first, it doesn‚Äôt translate too well into our actions when facing circumstances. It is easy to get lost in the middle of so many people here. What is difficult to achieve is your foothold. To stand up for yourself and for things you believe.",
      "For a long time, I had difficulty opening up to people. I would be throwing my head back and laughing but in my mind, I would be floating somewhere else. I‚Äôd be working on my thesis but not really putting my heart into it. But with some great support, I was able to find my step. One of my biggest complaints about not being motivated to wake up in the morning has been replaced by a phase where I wake up early. My friends and I either go for a run or hear each other crib about muscle pain. I got back to painting and writing. I started to spend a significant part of the day in the lab. I realised how I‚Äôd put myself in the backseat in all of these interactions. The most challenging climb you‚Äôd probably have to do is regain that confidence and belief that you can and will feel better in some time. But get a bunch of reliable friends and do things that make you happy, say, paint a picture or sing a song or watch someone skateboard, and I tell you, you‚Äôll make it. While I say this, I also want you to know that checking up on your friends is equally important. As the student community in IIT K, we shoulder this responsibility to make the campus a safe place. And all of it starts with us. It begins with kindness.",
      "Undergraduate folks are a significant part of my social circle on campus. And it was primarily because of the Japanese class I‚Äôd taken in my first year. Sometimes, some friends would talk about an incident, and midway I‚Äôd finish the story for them because I‚Äôd already heard it from the folks in my Japanese class! But the account has been a little different for many of my batchmates from MTech. PG students have very heavily dominated their circles. While I acknowledge that many factors may contribute to this, I still find this a little unsettling. It is a vibrant, buzzing campus, and if there is one thing I felt needed to change, it would be to remove the ‚Äúbarriers‚Äù that make this interaction between UGs and PGs difficult. I believe we have a lot to learn from each other. I wanted to join many cultural clubs, but often, my hesitance came from the fact that I barely saw any PG students on the board. And I was confused for a long time as to whether the clubs even entertained PG students. Many things like pre-registering for courses were completely new things for us, and it felt like we could‚Äôve done with smoother navigation",
      "But I‚Äôve had a lot of fun here. I have laughed till I cried, spent evenings on rooftops, attended the Japanese class from OAT, discussed conspiracy theories while making our way to the Environmental Science building, named dogs, eaten every special dinner at each hall, planned things that haven‚Äôt materialised yet, made people hear the trashiest jokes they will ever hear in a lifetime, been a TA in a course and read some really interesting assignments, spent entire days at CCD sometimes (read: most of the time) not really working on the thesis but hearing stories about campus life and people and definitely ranting, helped set friends up on dates, gotten my hair coloured more number of times than the seasons I‚Äôve seen on this campus, encouraged and been very successful at getting others to dye their hair too, obsessed over corn and ‚Äúmess ka khaana‚Äù at some point (trust me, there is a phase in everyone‚Äôs lives where they desperately miss mess food no matter how much they‚Äôve hated it), cried when people started leaving campus, switched from coffee to tea to water to coffee, painted rainbows on beautiful, beautiful people, played Valorant with a team and beaten some asses and gotten ours beaten too, found the highest points on the campus, been broke at the middle of each month without fail and met some terrifically amazing people. I named this piece ‚ÄúRound Trips‚Äù because as college ends, I realise that some bookings are one-way. Your college life isn‚Äôt a round trip. It‚Äôll never be the same people or the same time again. So when you pack your bags and leave this campus, you must ensure you do not leave behind what-ifs. The sad part about your what-ifs is that they‚Äôll probably never be found. They‚Äôll probably gather dust in the corner of the room you last occupied on the campus or hide behind the paper bills at the CCD counter. Nobody writes your story after you. So make sure that whenever you want to try something and feel like you‚Äôll have time later, perhaps you‚Äôll not. It feels like it was yesterday I reached campus. As I write this article, I know how dangerously close I am to having my last day on campus. I wish I could stay longer. I wish I could get some other people to stay longer, too, because what will this campus feel like without the familiar faces?! I‚Äôm also extremely grateful to a bunch of people who I can‚Äôt imagine the campus without ‚Äì Tarish, Ruchira, Vinay, Shahid, Abhijeet, Ratnangshu, Akhilesh, Subham, Avisha, Pratham, Adithya, the Decision Lab, my supervisor, the pups of the campus who grew up too soon and every other person who I‚Äôve gotten the chance to interact with during my time at the campus. I‚Äôm also indebted to the Japanese class fraternity (special mentions: Tarish and Yash) for giving me a glimpse of campus life way before I was here.",
      "Time will zoom past you. So do the things that bring you joy. There are tons of things to do on the campus and tons of facilities that you‚Äôll never get in one place. So make use of it. And even better, talk to the crazy talented people here. We hold ourselves back so often because we make assumptions in our heads. The world out there is beautiful. Give people a chance. Let the sunshine enter. Things may go wrong, but you‚Äôre stronger than that. Someone has got your back. And more importantly, remember your life isn‚Äôt a round trip either. We rarely get to re-live moments. So what we have right now, let‚Äôs make the most out of it!",
      "As I leave, I carry this warm feeling in my heart. It reminds me of this poem I‚Äôd read way back in school. It said:",
      "‚ÄúToday the world is a little more my own-‚Äù (Punishment in Kindergarten, Kamala Das).Today, it is.",

      "Ritwik Vashistha, a Y20 Masters student from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. In this edition, he talks about his journey that led him to IIT, and how he chose what his future would hold for him.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "My time at IIT Kanpur has been amazing, albeit short. I learned a lot of things and not just statistics. As I leave IIT Kanpur, I would like to share some experiences in the hope that they might help future students decide about their future. However, before I talk about the experiences, I would like to share a personal story about getting into IIT.",
      "The desire to get into IIT has been a long one. I got into the rat race to prepare for JEE after class 10. Contrary to many people‚Äôs experiences, no one really forced me to pursue engineering. At that time, I was really fascinated by programming, and computer science engineering at some IIT seemed to be the best possible outcome for me. However, I really didn‚Äôt study well in the next 2 years, and seeing some of my peers perform at FIITJEE made me realize that I am never going to be as good as them at solving those PCM questions. I kind of gave up on getting into IIT and decided that I‚Äôll settle for some NIT/IIIT/BITS. But life had a good lesson in store for me, and I didn‚Äôt perform well enough even in mains to get into a decent NIT/IIIT. Fortunately, I got in touch with a professor of statistics from IIM B, and he recommended I go for statistics and not pursue engineering. I took up his advice after seeing my situation, and luckily it worked out very well for me. I enjoyed studying Statistics at Delhi University and managed to get into IITK for my Master‚Äôs. This was not what I had imagined in high school, but I fortunately still got what I wished for earlier, albeit in a different way.",
      "One of life‚Äôs difficult decisions is deciding a career path for yourself. During my Master‚Äôs, I decided to take a shot at this decision and contemplated various possibilities for myself after completing my Master‚Äôs. Initially, I was interested in becoming a diplomat and an IFS officer because of my interest in International Relations/policymaking and the push from my parents to become a bureaucrat. Then, I also considered working in the industry after my Master‚Äôs as a data scientist or Quantitative Analyst. Most of my peers were interested in working in the industry. Finally, I also thought about going for a Ph.D. and becoming a researcher. Deciding between these 3 options was a difficult task, and I learned a lot in the process of finalizing what to do.",
      "My strategy was to read and learn in detail about each option, talk to multiple people about these options and then compare the pros and cons. This didn‚Äôt happen in a day; it took me around a year to make the final decision. Regarding IFS, I remember attending a talk by Mr. Rajan Singh (ex IPS officer who‚Äôs an alumnus of IITK) and realizing that a government job won‚Äôt be a good fit for me because of my nature. This wasn‚Äôt the sole reason behind my decision to not pursue IFS, but like a final nail in the coffin after considering the option for months. In the case of industry, I talked with lots of alumni of my course about their job through the help of LinkedIn. I started realizing that joining the industry right after my Master‚Äôs won‚Äôt also be the best option for me because the jobs available to students in my course don‚Äôt seem to be interesting enough in reality. This doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt exciting jobs in the market but that it would probably be challenging for me to land that job right after my Masters‚Äô.",
      "Then finally, I was also considering doing a Ph.D., and I talked with my seniors and professors. I very clearly remember what one of the professors told me about Industry vs Ph.D. ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou seem to be an above-average student to me, and my recommendation to all above-average students is to go for Ph.D. because they will get bored soon with the daily tasks in ordinary data analyst jobs‚Äù. This resonated with what I had observed while talking with multiple alumni working in different companies. Finally, my Pfizer internship helped me in making a decision. While working at Pfizer on an applied research project, I realized that I enjoyed the work there ‚Äì reading research papers, understanding different statistical methods, observing where those methods might run into problems, and working on solving them. This was the exciting work I wanted to do in an industry job. However, I learned that Pfizer and many top research-oriented companies now hire only fresher Ph.D.s or Master‚Äôs graduates with 5-6 years of experience for such applied research-oriented roles.",
      "Additionally, I realized that I am more interested in working on problems where I might need to develop a new method rather than just working on repeated applications of widely used popular methods on different issues. This realization, combined with the fact that a Ph.D. might be needed for ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô applied research roles in the industry, pushed me to consider going for a Ph.D. where I could focus on methodological or applied research problems. Therefore, I finally decided to apply for Ph.D. programs in the US and sit for placements as a backup. During placements, I got placed at a bank for an analyst role. In February, I got to know that I have been accepted into my dream Ph.D. program at The University of Texas at Austin.",
      "This may sound trivial but the main takeaway from this experience is that if you are confused between multiple options, talk to different people about them and get a good idea about some options by trying them out. Doing both things will help you understand what will work for you and what wouldn‚Äôt. But remember that in the end, no outcome can be 100% correct; you‚Äôll always take a risk by going for one option over another. In my case, I am definitely taking a risk as it might turn out that I don‚Äôt enjoy research as much as I had hoped and if things don‚Äôt work out, I will try out something else. However, something that I have realized over the last 2 years is that we shouldn‚Äôt be too afraid of failing. It‚Äôs okay to be a little fearful of failure but it shouldn‚Äôt stop us from trying to fulfill our dreams even if it‚Äôs risky!",
      "In the end, I would just like to say that I feel elated to have been a student at IITK. I enjoyed being here and I am now looking forward to being an alumnus. In case anyone is interested in knowing more about applying for Ph.D. abroad or any other thing, feel free to connect with me viaLinkedIn.",
      "PS ‚Äì It would be wrong of me to not acknowledge the favorable situations that helped me decide about the future. First of all, I was fortunate enough to have a great CPI at the end of my first year, which allowed me the flexibility of thinking about applying for a Ph.D. during the summer holidays. Maybe, if I didn‚Äôt have a good CPI, then I wouldn‚Äôt be very enthusiastic about applying for Ph.D. due to its perceived importance in the application. However, having gone through the Ph.D. application season, I think CPI doesn‚Äôt matter much. If anyone is having doubts about going for further studies due to their low CPI, then my suggestion would be to not get discouraged but focus on highlighting other parts of their application, such as research experiences. Secondly, I was lucky to get an internship at Pfizer and have a great experience. My mentor at Pfizer was great, and he agreed to extend my internship to help me do my MSc project with Pfizer. He also gave me a great recommendation letter and an informal assurance about working with Pfizer if my Ph.D. plans didn‚Äôt work out. This helped me not worry about the future and apply for a Ph.D. with a backup option.",

      "",
      "When I started on this journey of pursuing a BS in Chemistry at IIT Kanpur, there were a lot of things I was very excited about but equally intimidated about: Staying away from home for the very first time and dealing with life on my own, getting to be amidst some of the best young minds of the country while secretly battling theImposter syndrome since day 0, exploringChemistry- the subject that I was fascinated by, that majorly got me through all the nine entrance examinations that I had to appear (thanks to my parents who thought their daughter should be a doctor, but why not try engineering and research too!), and the plethora of possibilities that lay ahead of me; the list of all such things, that gave me sleepless nights before joining IITK with a dream to graduate one day with flying colours, is endless. For me, college life was very idealistic, both academic and non-academic. The pressure of living up to those expectations while coming from a‚Äòlower branch‚Äò (which was made very clear during orientation itself and repeated on several occasions throughout the first year) got to my head.",
      "Hailing from an interior area,without any coaching background, having been bullied for several years since childhood and through school, and eventually ending up in a place like this where every person was better than another, in some aspect or the other, shook my self-confidence to the core. Some very unexpected series of encounters and confrontations got the best of me in my first year at IIT Kanpur. Iwent from being a forever-enthusiastic, ready-to-mingle, fun-loving teenager to a timid, cocooned-up fresher.I was actively trying to avoid confrontations, interactions, and even participating in events out of my comfort zone (something that I was never afraid of since early childhood). I also felt guilty that I had no control over external situations that changed me in ways I didn‚Äôt like. However, I didn‚Äôt feel capable of battling these changes at this point.",
      "I wouldn‚Äôt want to delve deeper into the details of those difficult circumstances that I had to live through. Still, all those challenges somehow got stuck in my head. I almost started using them as excuses for my academic underperformance or inability to do justice to my potential while also suffering physically and mentally. I am incredibly thankful to a few generous seniors who stood by me and Shivangi, who lent a shoulder whenever needed throughout those tough times and helped me believe in myself when I almost gave up.",
      "I realise that most of my readers here might not relate to the idea of such challenging times for a fresher after anti-ragging measures had already been enforced. However, there is still a section of people in every batch, who have to deal with a lot of challenges because of the established hierarchy, traditions, stereotypical perspectives, ‚Äòjudging-by-the-cover‚Äô attitude and unempathetic intentions of their peers, sometimes even owing to factors totally out of their control.Beyond the rainbow tainted aspirations of a teenager who came with the expectations of everything warm and vibrant at the place of her dreams, I learned many valuable lessons, the hard way mostly, from those failures, mistakes, and challenges. It made me stronger and firmly determined to turn around my academic graph and social presence. At the end of my first year, I had started breaking out of this vicious loop of self-doubt and pity. I began to grow the courage to stand and fight for myself.",
      "Right after the end semester examinations of my first year, I tirelessly wrote 108 emails to Professors all across the country, seeking any training or internship. I sought a real taste of Chemistry that I was so eager to explore but was not even introduced to in any worthy sense in my first year. Deriving passion and inspiration from everything that I wanted to amend from my first year, I ensured that each email was specific to the Professor‚Äôs research profile. I honestly highlighted that I was just an inexperienced fresher, but with a genuine interest in learning even the most challenging tasks required of me. This determination fetched me myfirst summer internship at IISER Kolkata at the Theoretical and Quantum Chemistry Labwith just a six-pointer CPI. All I had to do throughout my summer was explore, practice, and implement complex algebra and quantum mechanics, which were dreadful for me during IC courses in the first year. But this time, I resisted giving up. Instead, I realised that my shattered self-confidence kept me from studying with complete focus and intent, which led to my poor performance in those courses. The words of my mentor at the end of the internship will forever continue to inspire me ‚Äì",
      "‚ÄúThose grades on a sheet of paper cannot define the potential you hold and the place where you are meant to be, but your courage and persistence do. You have proved yourself and everything that you are worthy of!‚Äù",
      "However, I did not pursue quantum mechanics for very long after that. I felt a strong inclination toward the chemistry-biology interface. Still, this internship shall continue to be the most inspiring phase of my life. I faced several setbacks in learning complex algebra, considering my concepts from the introductory courses weren‚Äôt clear. Yet I managed my way out and performed pretty decently while also finding a direction for how to determine my areas of research interest in Chemistry.",
      "I carried forward this inspiration and determination to make the best of my times ahead, and those efforts paid off. Despite the overloaded semesters, interdisciplinary courses, and everything else that I was afraid of still being around, my career graph took an ascent. I had grown to be immune to those factors and started to work on my flaws, little by little. It worked as a great feedback loop, in which the result of the last semester only made me work several manifolds harder for the next. I was no longer afraid of exploring challenging and demanding courses, of underperforming or failing.All that mattered now was my intent to learnand identify which research field would be my perfect match. All my department-compulsory and elective courses in Chemistry went exceptionally well. Although the foundational preparation and understanding these courses ought to provide are yet to bridge a huge gap, these courses nevertheless inspired me to explore different research domains. They introduced me to a mentor without whom I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to decide my future motivation for research. I was allowed to participate in lab training, group meetings, presentations, and seminars from early on, which revived all the valuable qualities that I lost in my first year. I started taking an active interest in current chemistry research trends, and even my inexperienced questions opened the doors to some unexpectedly wonderful opportunities. Because I wasdetermined to pursue higher studies in Chemistry, I worked on channelling all my energy and time in that direction. I am thankful to so many inspiring people from very diverse domains who identified my enthusiasm, sat down with me to organise my template, discussed internships and graduate school protocols, and helped me understand how to build a good portfolio for the future. Thepandemictook a significant toll on my health yet again. Being confined at home for almost 1.5 years wasextremely stressful as I lost some very important national and international internships and opportunities. Also, I had previously decided to participate in the ongoing research of a group I joined during the winter of 2019. Instead, all I could do was attend online lectures and eventually online laboratory classes too, which, honestly, were hardly of any practical use. However, the concepts did widen the knowledge space.",
      "It would be unfair if I did not mention the contribution of a few people who were my pillars of strength, a powerhouse of care, warmth, and inspiration through the disheartening phase of the Covid19 pandemic. As I had previously mentioned, many of the attributes of my personality and interests changed when I joined IITK. Still, theone thing that stayed constant and has been my saviour all my life was music. The pandemic was bearable despite many challenges and constraints that I faced at home, majorly because of music and the bonds that it brought forth. I joined theMusic Club, IIT Kanpur, during the Freshers in 2018. It was possibly the only thing that I was unafraid of exploring and giving my best in.",
      "My faith in music and love for the art was way above everything else. It helped me continue with the Club and eventually become aCoordinator during the 2020-2021 term. I met some very talented and passionate people at the Music Club, who made me realise the immense scope of growth by exploring different genres of music. These people will continue to inspire my musical journey wherever I go. I feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to jam and bond with such a vibrant group. I have grown immensely, not just as a musician but also as a person, since the first time I joined. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful to every senior and Club member who contributed to this process.",
      "",
      "The one name that deserves mention in my AWL is Sankalp Sharma, a fellow batchmate from Chemical Engineering and an equally passionate and talented member of the Music Club. Without him, I would‚Äôve never realised thegravity and value of friendship in true essence. Sankalp has been one of the kindest and most generous of all people that I have ever come across. I can‚Äôt thank my stars enough that music in my life could foster a bond so invaluable as the one I shared with him during these years. That empowered me like never before and led to some very essential realisations of my flaws that needed work and of the stronger and braver versions of myself that I strived to become every day. I can not imagine surviving through my Coordinator term without him as a fellow Coordinator by my side and through all the thick and thin in all these years at IIT. I only hope to see this bond growing stronger at the core, despite time and distance, in the years to come.",
      "Managing multiple positions of responsibility and juggling several interests at once was also a challenge. However, my academic results and performance in all such PORs and additional commitments were the best in the semesters I had many of them. Hence, I would say thatwhen vested with multiple commitments, undoubtedly set a priority order but never try to avoid such opportunities. With time, you will learn to manage all your roles efficiently. You might even manage to give your best and achieve unexpected heights with practice, patience, and dedication. My term as a Coordinator of the Music Club involved a lot of challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, which forced all the student activities to transition into online mode. Still, we managed to find new and innovative ways to expand our horizons. We managed to bring together alumni from as long back as the 1970s in a celebration of the musical heritage of IITK, only to inspire the upcoming generations to lead the path of glory ahead. This event, called the‚ÄòEvergreen melodies 2021‚Äô, shall continue to be a major highlight of my journey at IITK. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to accomplish this without my fellow Coordinators, Sankalp, Prayas, and Adarsh, and the support of my Y18 MClub batchmates. Despite the loaded semester and commitments being a Coordinator, both the semesters of my tenure proved to be quite decent and inspired me to perform even better ahead.",
      "Academically, by this time, I had started exploring different areas of interest while maintaining a constant interest in Chemical Biology. To ensure that the lost internships during the pandemic (overseas- at Munich, Germany, and national- at TIFR, Hyderabad) would not deprive me of my share of learning and growth, I enrolled in a plethora of detailed online courses, religiously read endless papers. I tried to understand what ignites the fire in me and what doesn‚Äôt work for me, and I also took up online projects and the SURGE 2021 Summer internship. These proved to be highly beneficial in building a strong resume for graduate applications. Meanwhile, being disheartened at the absence of practical experience, Iconverted my BS into a Dual Degreeprogram. I overworked through all the semesters to complete higher courses to prepare for the graduate school requirements. However, by the end of 2021, I realised that a Dual degree‚Äôs course and program objectives did not align with the goal that I had set for myself in the upcoming year. In the moment of that realisation, I decided to give my best and start applying to Graduate schools with whatever knowledge and experience I had, without any fear or self-doubt coming in my way andrisking dropping my Dual Degree- a risk that eventually paid off!I wrote countless cold emails and started appearing in in-take interviews as early as August, which continued until February 2022.",
      "This entire process was indeed very stressful, but more importantly, lonesome, as most of the batch of 2022 was preparing/ sitting for placements. Therefore, most of my friends/acquaintances were overwhelmed with their preparations. I didn‚Äôt have any peers in the same boat as me who would relate in real essence and provide me with a shoulder of empathy that I needed. Even though this phase, Sankalp was the most resourceful and encouraging guiding light that I could ask for, despite his overwhelming preparations in profiles and domains completely disjoint from mine. This phase made me see the absence of support from the institute, lack of empathy and motivation from peers for those taking the courage to walk the ‚Äòroad not taken‚Äô, unlike those who choose to sit for placements having the SPO there by protocol, throughout the process, if not anyone else. It was also the phase when for the first time, Iquestioned if Chemistry was the right fit for me? Or were the last three years a sheer mistake?Did I give up on financial independence and instead chose a path of sheer uncertainty for myself?",
      "Once I made up my mind and held onto the courage through all the thick and thin, I managed to answer all those questions of uncertainty that had clouded up my mind back then. I got support from Sankalp, Prayas, Shivangi, Ayushi, Sonali, Sumit, Kothary (Rishabh), Pal (Adarsh), Wasif, Arunim, Yashkrit, Swadha, Basu (Ayush), Naskar (Wrishik) and so many others from my friend circle and even my seniors. In the end, the process has been unexpectedly rewarding. I could‚Äôve never imagined being selected for a PhD position at the institute, which was my first preference, under a researcher whose work genuinely inspired me. It has given me sleepless nights, trying to think how I could learn and contribute to the fascinating research that her lab focuses on. Once again, my belief that handling multiple responsibilities honestly and with dedication only makes us more efficient proved correct. The parallelly ongoing semester proved to be the academic peak for me, with an SPI of 10. The moment of the result brought happy tears as I had finallymanaged to live through one challenging rollercoaster ride from a six-pointer in the first year to finally an 8.5 pointer.",
      "With an offer in hand and many engagements related to Visa processing, I ensured that I continued to avidly follow the research and not become content with just the offer. I made memories that would last a lifetime in the last semester. Finally, I enjoyed the aftermath of not giving up and holding on tight through all the high and low phases of my journey at IITK. Bidding goodbyes to my friends, who have now become a family for life, was the toughest part of this journey. But I believe that our stories and connections still have a long way to go, and I wholeheartedly wish for the most deserving places and zeniths for all of my graduating colleagues in the years to come!",
      "In the end, I am happy to think of all the bonds I made and the lessons I learned, irrespective of the easier or the harder way. I am proud of theincredible metamorphosisthat I underwent, from the first year to the final year, without giving up on my fascination for Chemistry and the million dreams that still keep me awake!",
      "My final words for any fresher or current student reading this piece would be that ‚Äì",
      "‚ÄúYour journey through college need not be defined by the craziest of acts that you managed to pull off, the number of popular groups that you succeeded in being a part of, or by the transformation into a daring ‚Äòchill‚Äô person that you ought to have become. Beyond the idealistic perceptions and stereotypes,let your college life be a victory anthem of your transformation into a stronger and better version of yourself, now skillfully prepared to face the odds of the world with a treasure full of diverse experiences.Let it be an anthem of your undeterred courage of hanging in there, through the failures and the rock bottoms, and of not giving up the faith in yourself. Let your college life bea celebration of ‚ÄòYOU‚Äô‚Äì the transition of a timid, naive first-year student into whoever you have become today. Owing to your own unique set of struggles and choices, failures and successes, mistakes and learnings, memories and voids of heartbreaks and unabated love, and so much more on this journey, that has added a lot of meaning and provided you with a direction for your future ahead.‚Äù",
      "Here‚Äôs an ode to the place that will remain my home forever, the best four years of my life to date, and some of the most invaluable memories and precious bonds that I could ask for!‚Äù",

      "Debarsho Sannyasi is a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He pens down his time at IITK highlighting his decisions and learnings.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I arrived at IITK with an open mind and a ‚Äògo with the flow‚Äô nature without preconceived expectations. My sole goal was to make these four years worthwhile and be academically ahead of the curve. The competitive nature of JEE days left a deep imprint on me. To be honest, I arrived at IITK with a similar mindset. I was not interested in any specific branches, and I got into the electrical department only due to my JEE rank. This article will highlight the most critical phases of my journey, decisions, and learnings.",
      "Having studied Computer science in Classes 11 and 12, I had a gut feeling that computer science subjects would interest me. I learned that branch change to CSE is only possible with adouble dassa. On the bright side, IIT Kanpur does not consider the JEE ranks (unlike some other IITs) for branch change. Also, around 10-15% of students receive an A grade in each course. Thus I started believing in the possibility of branch change. The most challenging part of achievingdouble dassais that one can not slack off even slightly. It requires performing considerably well throughout the semester in all the courses. Still, somehow I felt that being in the top 50-60 students in a class of 450 students is realistically possible.",
      "We are taught many courses in our first year, and most of us have personal preferences during our JEE days. I have seen many people having a biased notion of some courses at the very beginning itself due to their JEE preferences which usually leads to disinterest and poor results in those courses. On the contrary, I believe that we should approach the courses at IITK with an open mind as they have stark differences from the ones taught during JEE. Seeing the courses as a means to expand our knowledge will surely help to drive away from the monotonous nature of some courses. But that is how things are because for adouble dassa,you have to score well in those courses in which you are not interested.So why not approach them positively. Also, please do not take any course component lightly, no matter how small its weightage is. I know cases where an A grade is missed by the barest of the margins. Revise the course materials such as slides, lecture notes, assignments, etc., as much as possible so that the content is at your fingertips. The majority of the questions are from these only. Having followed the above steps, I performed pretty well in all my courses in the first year. Another essential factor is to try and not give up till there is some chance left, however slight. There have been instances when I initially lacked behind in a course. Still, I could eventually make up for it because I believed in the slim chances left. The day when I received my second-semester grades, which confirmed mydouble dassawas genuinely enthralling. The best feeling in life is succeeding in things you have worked on the hardest.",
      "Despite scoring well, my first-year journey was not as smooth as silk. From the initial days, I wanted to maximise the possibility of gettingdouble dassa. I used to think of any other activity as an element of time waste that would eventually decrease my likelihood. Therefore, I did not participate even in a single event organised for freshers. I was not involved in interhall competitions like Galaxy and Takneek, and none of the clubs or societies. The hall meetings addressed by the HECs for such events were a complete bootless errand for me. I spent my maximum time either attending lectures or in my room. My interactions with my roommate and wingmates were minimal, and I was almost always engrossed in my acads. And these pretty much set the tone for the rest of my journey at IITK. Was this the correct decision? Looking back, I now realise that it was my inability and lack of confidence to manage things simultaneously. But there are very few who can get themselves actively involved and maintain stellar grades in the first year, and I was not one of them. For me, branch change had the highest priority above anything else. I could not experiment with it, as it was only a one-time opportunity. I would still consider this to be among the good decisions I made. My gut feeling proved correct by getting a branch change to CSE, and I enjoyed most of the CSE coursework. In fact, I have done almost all my OE credits in CSE courses. It has also helped immensely in my internship and placement season, as some of the required preparation overlapped with my coursework. Placement preparation alongside the hectic curriculum of the electrical department is quite daunting. I still won‚Äôt change my decision if given a chance. One cannot do everything. There are always things left behind. What is essential is to be confident in your decisions/choices and not be scared to let things go. Having said this, I have learned quite late the importance of good friends and healthy relations in our lives. Hence, I have realised that one should learn multitasking and efficient time management as early as possible and should always set priorities.",
      "I want to emphasise an aspect that I feel is important. The first-year interhall events witness massive participation from freshers. Most of them are either forced or persuaded by seniors or peers. The preparation for these events is weeks before the event. It is highly time and energy-consuming, which almost always disrupts the academic flow of a student. Despite the large footfall of participation, very few of them can pursue it forward or gain something fruitful out of it, damaging their first-year grades. Although a good CPI is not a key to everything, still it does not make sense to screw up your first-year CPI due to over-participation and involvement in random activities. The first year is the best and most accessible opportunity to score big for most. Poor first-year CGPA leaves very little time for recovery for the internship season after the 2nd year. It is best to participate in selective events that actually interest you and not get swayed away by pressure from seniors and peers. It will help laser focus on only those particular activities and not hamper academics.",
      "The mistakes during my internship season have prepared me well for the placements season. I had kept my 7th semester very light. For the internship, I had practised CP from Codeforces, but it did not help much. Having studied the theory well in my algorithms courses, I mainly focused on hard questions in Leetcode for my placements. Unlike CodeForces, Leetcode contains more algorithmic questions whose pattern is similar to the company tests. But CodeForces might help you get familiarised with the time-constrained environment. You can test yourself periodically on this platform. As there are so many things to prepare within a limited time, I did not hesitate to refer to the solutions to the Leetcode problems regularly. However, I made sure I completely understood the problem and its solution before moving on. This method helped me cover a large number of problems in less time.",
      "Along with the software profiles, I also aimed for the Quant profile in HFTs. For these, probability, statistics, and puzzles were much more critical than CP. Most HFTs conduct separate quant and software profile tests, and CP is not present in quant tests. I started with the book ‚Äô50 Challenging Problems in Probability‚Äô, then moved on to brainstellar.com, and ended with the first few chapters of the book ‚ÄòA Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews‚Äô by Xinfeng Zhou. These are the best resources for quant preparation and almost cover everything required. Many companies ask similar questions in their tests and interviews, so it is crucial to solve these problems repeatedly. Mark the critical problems or problems with a unique solution and visit them periodically. The preparation helped me a lot. I got shortlisted by many companies on day one and successfully got offers from my topmost preferences. The best advice I would give is to remain calm during the whole placement season. Do sufficient preparation in a time-efficient manner, and always look forward to the following tests and interviews.",
      "We were called back to the campus during our final semester. By then, I had realised that I needed to make the best of it and do things that I had missed during my first year. It was difficult initially, and I often felt the sense of missing out on so much fun. Eventually, I had some best memories of my time at IITK. IIT Kanpur and the CSE department hold a special place in my heart. I still remember being awestruck seeing the grandeur of IITK during orientation. In the last few days, I would roam around the campus, visit those spots I had not visited yet, and relive the moments for the last time. My journey was full of ups and downs but, most importantly, of learnings and humbling experiences. Over these years, there are a few things that I wish to have approached differently, taken more risks, and gone out of my comfort zone at times. But overall, I am pleased with the outcome. I had achieved the things I prioritised the most. Still, I learned that some things that I did not prioritise also have significant importance in that process. I will try to incorporate these learnings into my life in the future. IIT Kanpur is a place that provides an ocean of choices and opportunities. Still, you must be aware that your time is limited. Every time you complete one thing, there is always a thing waiting with open claws to gulp you up. So make your decisions and set your priorities carefully. Till then, adios IIT Kanpur. Feel free to reach out or ping me if you feel I can help you in any way:)‚Äì All the best for your journey at IITK.",

      "Our lives do not always proceed the way we plan or predict. Life is very unpredictable, and we should always be ready for something that is not intended, something that is not expected.",
      "We always have some expectations from ourselves. At every stage of life, we have a plan to execute, and when we achieve the goal, we feel relaxed. When everything in our lives goes according to plan and according to our expectations, and when we achieve what we set out to do, there are times when we simply cannot accept the fact that we have failed at something that we worked so hard to achieve. We cannot get over it, and we get deep into it.",
      "Similar is my story, and I know it did not only happen to me; it happens to many. For all of us, life was very smooth till we got admitted to IITK. Smooth, because we were achieving our targets, we were fulfilling the expectations of our parents. We had done good in school, scored well in 10th and 12th, cleared JEE, one of the most challenging examinations, and got admission to one of the most prestigious institutes in our country. When we moved into IITK, we were introduced to a new set of people and a new peer group. We had some plans, some expectations from us, and our families had some expectations. It happens with many that they could not perform up to their expectations. They couldn‚Äôt get good grades and couldn‚Äôt perform like what they had done in the past. It grew more difficult for them to go over it, and they dove deeper into it. They started feeling hopeless and defeated because they hadn‚Äôt been to such scenarios. They had never expected that they might ever feel any problem in their academic life.",
      "The course of a person‚Äôs life is influenced by a wide variety of causes and multiple variables. Life is highly complicated; it does not always continue in the way we want it to, and we cannot control every variable in its course. We just need to have faith in our capabilities. We have done the things in the past, and we can do them later on as well.",
      "At every stage of our life, many unwanted and unanticipated things will happen. Our life is not only governed by us but also by our environment and by the people around us. Be ready for unexpected things and accept them with open hands. We can control what is in our hands, but not everything. Focus on controllable, keep following the process and leave the rest.",

It‚Äôs the time that I summarize my four years of IITK and pack my four-year memories with me and cherish them for life.

On my first day of college 20th July 2018, I was homesick and was crying for home and now after 4 years, when leaving college on 12th May 2022, I was campus-sick and cried for the campus with the song in the background playing ‚ÄúKabhi Alvida Na Kehna‚Äù, hugging, crying and making promises that we will meet again soon.",
      "These four years had changed me as a person a lot. Before joining IITK, I was very confused because I was getting a chemistry branch and IITs are supposed to be BTech degree programs but mine was B.S. When I was allotted B.S, in Chemistry I thought of taking a drop and sitting for JEE again. But then somehow I dropped the plan and felt like ‚ÄúJo Hoga Dekha jayega‚Äù and believe me this was my best decision of not taking a drop. I entered IITK as an introverted kid, I remember my first day here at IITK. My parents were there with me and everything was new in that hot summer. I met my Student Guide and Behenas together in the evening for 10-15min. I left with my parents to stay in a hotel with them as I was not ready to leave them. On the next day, orientation started and my parents left for home in the night. At that time I cried a lot because this was the first time in my life when I was away from my parents. I was homesick for almost a month. I started getting involved in different activities(Freshers, Fests, SnT club activities, etc.) and finally, I became part of the Election Commission as an Election Officer and that journey went on to finally becoming Chief Election Officer.",
      "As I am not too good at making friends, It takes time for me to get comfortable with someone and share things. But I met some of the most amazing people in my four years during Elections whom I won‚Äôt be able to forget in my life. Every person taught me something and helped me improve myself, some people became my family for life.",
      "I still remember in my first year there was a session on ‚Äúknow your department‚Äù and 3 seniors took that session. In that session, we were told that there are very few companies that open for the Chemistry branch and those companies too prefer other branches over chemistry in placements. At that time I thought chemistry would not give me a job so I should start taking interest in research and would need to go for higher education(in which I was not interested), but during the CHM102 course, I understood that chemistry is not for me and I didn‚Äôt have enough cpi to change to the good branch. Then I heard ‚Äúcoding Karlo, job mil jayegi‚Äù but when I was doing ESC101, I felt coding is not my cup of tea. I was very worried about the future but thought let‚Äôs go with the flow and I continued working at various places. But after seeing my first year CPI I understood that I need to prioritize what I want to do. I can‚Äôt do everything and focus on academics at the same time.",
      "So, at that time I prioritized the Election Commission and Udghosh to work for the second year.",
      "Then in march during Holi break most of the people went home, I stayed back at the campus during vacation but then we received a mail on 13th March 2020 that we need to go home because of covid, and then who knew that Covid will take 1.5 Years from our college life, during that time there were very few people with whom I was in contact regularly because I was not good at maintaining bonds through calls and texts but there were some people who made efforts to maintain that bond virtually too and they made me come through that covid time by being in constant touch through calls and texts(Thanks to them).",
      "In my third year, my involvement was only as a manager of the Election Commission from where the actual change in my personality started showing up. I started becoming an ambivert from an introverted person, I was not afraid to talk to anyone. This change was seen by my parents and they became confident too that I can handle myself now. Then in my 4th year, I wanted to be the core team of Udghosh because I worked for Udghosh since my first year and always wanted to be the one conducting it as well as Chief Election Officer obviously because EC is my family and I enjoy working as an EC member, I can‚Äôt leave the one thing that is very close to my heart(There are many who criticize it, but idc it‚Äôs my family :)), but taking both positions was not possible for me because of Placement season and also a conflict of interest in two positions. So, I was confused between the two but then CEO nominations were out before Udghosh and I applied for CEO. Then finally the journey took me to the Chief Election officer which gave me a lot of different experiences and made me realize many things that I myself didn‚Äôt know I am capable of handling. My tenure as a Chief Election Officer was one of the adventurous journeys for me where I faced much criticism and went through various situations. There were times when I didn‚Äôt eat a single bite in a whole day, I was awakened for almost 48 hours to ensure everything is going smoothly at election time, and I was needed to take every decision very carefully because many out there were just waiting for me to make a small mistake and they again start criticizing the EC. There were times when I cried too because it was getting too hectic for me to handle various situations and pressure at the same time but obviously I couldn‚Äôt show it in front of anybody otherwise my team would have lost their motivation and I wanted to look strong in front of everyone. If someone had told me that I would need to face all of these situations if I become CEO, still I would have become the CEO because of things that I learned in this journey, I couldn‚Äôt have learned anywhere else. I was able to handle those situations because of my team (I love you all my 007s) without whom elections were not possible for me. I especially want to thank those people who supported me at that time of Elections and motivated me to go on. If I sum up my CEO tenure then it was one of the best experiences I had in my college life where I learned a lot and this made me a strong person both mentally and emotionally who will not be afraid of anything anymore.",
      "My fourth year flew away in the blink of an eye. 7th semester went on worrying about placements. Then the 8th Semester started with Elections till mid-February then Holi, Techkriti, Udghosh, and Antaragni back to the back, Batch Video, DE, photoshoot, EndSems then finally Hall-1 ki baarat was an amazing experience before leaving, With all of these four years flew away. And as this was the last semester, I had only 3 courses with 28 credits so I totally neglected the academics but then we received mail about offline classes and EndSems. At first, I got worried because seriously I didn‚Äôt study a word this semester, then I thought ‚ÄúAbhi enjoy kar lete hain, baar baar yeh din Nahi Milenge‚Äù but when EndSem started approaching I got panicked because there was one course in the IME Department where I was worried that I may fail this course but I don‚Äôt know how I received a ‚ÄòB‚Äô grade even after giving a disastrous End semester exam‚Ä¶xD. If I speak about placements, I was not sure what profile I want to apply for. But I knew I definitely don‚Äôt want a Software profile, so at that time I decided to go with a consulting profile. That time was one of the toughest times yet exciting, from not getting placed on Day-1&2 to getting placed on Day-3 in the profile I was interested in after many rejections.",
      "I finally got placed in a Consulting Firm, there were a few people who supported me and helped me to get through with whom I understood the actual meaning of friendship, staying up for me the whole night so that they can wake me up at the time of interview to coming to my room for checking up if I had eaten anything. I would never forget the support and motivation that I got from those people.",
      "Then the day came when people started leaving for home with nostalgic Goodbyes and finally I was leaving for home that ended with meeting some people a day before leaving and a perfect nostalgic night out with beautiful sunrise.",
      "‚ÄúThe bad news is time flies. The good news is you‚Äôre the pilot.‚Äù",
      "I just want to advise my juniors that you don‚Äôt need to be scared of anything or anyone, if you are right nothing can happen wrong with you just believe in yourself and keep on moving ahead in your life. You will not get these opportunities to explore your interests and learn anywhere else, Don‚Äôt lose these golden four years. Also, it is very important to make good friends while you are in college. I don‚Äôt think you can ever find such a great peer group in your life. Some people will get hurt because of you, you will get hurt because of them, and people will get distant in the journey but still, always cherish those moments that you spent with them because at some time they were a special part of your journey. With this, I want to wish you all the best for the future and feel free to reach out if you feel I can help you in any way possible",
      "‚ÄúYour future is an unwritten symphony just awaiting your creative, daring, and unique talent to make it a masterpiece.‚Äù",

      "Disclaimer:- This is just a story and what I have felt in my time here. The intent is not to sound too preachy but to just lay out what learning I could garner cause we all are learning each day, and I may be wrong at some points.",
      "‚ÄúHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.‚Äù",
      "As I sit here in my home(no, not IITK), I‚Äôm about to do one of the most challenging tasks any student would have to do, i.e. write in words the journey of IITK. Pouring out the emotions we feel during this time in a few words is almost impractical. However, I‚Äôll try to make it as brief as I can.",
      "Almost two years ago, I was appointed to look after the ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù article series as the Vox editor. I remember talking to seniors who were hesitant in writing the piece, wondering if they hadn‚Äôt done something special or hadn‚Äôt got the biggest job, or felt like they were irrelevant to the campus in regard toAs We Leave.",
      "I told them that, in my opinion, we, the students of IIT Kanpur, are just too special to have an ordinary story. I am saying this with 0% boast and exaggeration, but plain honesty. Every person here has a story to share, act as a guide for our future legacy bearers, and one to look back on and be aware of how things went about in these four years. Thus, even if not forAs We Leave, everyone should write their story and, if things align, get them published for people to view.",
      "I joined VOX in my first semester but didn‚Äôt work on something significant until one day when I got a call from a senior asking if I would like to work on an article related to election coverage. At the same time, a friend had asked for my id card to campaign for a candidate contesting for the President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana. And to get away from the campaigning (I mean, why should I campaign for someone I don‚Äôt even know), I agreed to be a part of the article(de-mock-racy). This article was not only big on paper but also opened my eyes to the ‚ÄúVox feel‚Äù. It made me understand how much power not only Vox but any general body member has. It made me realize that our campus can be dynamic at times, with hundreds of activities. There is not only learning everywhere, but you also meet seniors and people you connect with who would be of help in one way or another in the future. Hence, one should try not to sit in a room, watch series, play games, etc.",
      "When I came back to college in my second year, I thought of trying some other body, and thus I joined the election commission. Since I worked on the De-mock-racy article, I got a sense of excitement for elections being very dynamic.",
      "There too, I learned a lot, mostly around people. I also learned that trust is crucial in terms of who you trust and how much faith you bestow in that person. The exact amount of trust in various people can have very diverse consequences. It reminds me of something I would like to tell (entirely my opinion):",
      "Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Hear out their advice and suggestions, but don‚Äôt make decisions only for the sake of not hurting them. You never know if that person genuinely wants good for you or thinks of something else.",
      "There were a few moments during my second and third years when I felt like the biggest loser.",
      "I went to a Bollywood night at Antaragni in my second year with one of my friends. As we both entered the pronite ground, he ran away at the speed of the light to his friend circle distant in the crowd. The worst part was that since almost everyone was busy, he was the one who asked me to go with him. There I was for around 10 seconds, standing still, wondering what had happened. The fun music of Shankar Mahadevan, to which everyone was dancing, was not so fun for me. I wanted to run back to my room as fast as possible, change my clothes and go back to sleep. But I guess sometimes things happen for a reason. As I came to my room filled with disappointment and a tinge of existential crisis, after about an hour, one of my other friends called me up and asked me to come to the events ground. I said I am going to sleep, and he replied with some sweet sentences in Hindi, which I can‚Äôt quote here, and there I was at the events ground.",
      "That night turned out to be way more fun than I had expected. Trust me, Antaragni was right there at that moment for me because whatever you do in life, it‚Äôs not legendary unless your friends are there to be a part of it.",
      "Third-year, in my opinion, is one of the most significant years of college, as there is stress for bagging an internship (which I didn‚Äôt get, so I got no advice for that). Also, the students are heads/coordinators of bodies where they manage and take the lead over the members and the body‚Äôs activities. Being a Vox editor, I was also pretty excited about it. But Covid had other plans, and things didn‚Äôt go the way I expected/planned them to be in terms of the series and articles I had in mind. In the end, I was not completely happy. Still, I was satisfied with the work I could do as I felt that I was honest in my responsibility.",
      "When I looked after AWL a couple of years ago, I could not have been happy with the destiny that fell over. I got to meet one of the gems of a person through her AWL, whom otherwise I would have never met. A simple question of ‚ÄúHow were you able to manage your time and get the motivation to do so many things‚Äù turned into two years (and counting) of a beautiful friendship. When in lockdown, people needed someone to be there to listen to your everyday rant and BT. Even though she had a full-time job and home chores to do, she was there. She was still a senior who had many other juniors and colleagues to talk to and help, but she was there for a random Y18 like me. That made her special to me. She made me realize that sometimes, a few extra hours with someone can be enough even to cancel a trip to Banaras.",
      "And it hit me that Naina from YJHD rightfully said,",
      "",
      "2020 ended, and I was yet to understand what changes had occurred in me. It felt like nothing changed when almost everything had changed. The fourth year began with the stress of placements, and since I hadn‚Äôt done a proper internship, I was pretty worried. Still, I was sincere in devoting my time to preparing during the summers and a few months later. Though I didn‚Äôt like coding much, I would still spend a few hours on it, which made me feel optimistic.",
      "As the placement tests began, the administration announced that students could come to campus now. While it gave many people too much joy, I was hesitant. The question of how the bonds I‚Äôve developed with people online shall transcend into offline, how people have changed, how I‚Äôve changed, all this represented too much fuss, especially during the placement season. As Newton‚Äôs First Law stated, I needed some force to change my current state. And that force came in the form of advice, ‚ÄúGhar pe ruk sakta h, lekin wahan jayega to dosto ke physical presence mein support milega.‚Äù And there, at that moment, I packed my bags for Kanpur.",
      "As I reached there, the person who was amongst my closest people during the lockdown, with whom I sat for hours on zoom discussing the placement strategies, with whom I could share anything, who could do the same with me, seemed to disappear. This bond which felt the strongest and unbreakable for me broke, and there I was, stranded alone amidst the placement season.",
      "The fun part of these bonds you make with people is that you may be having the best of times, but the next moment you see that person chilling and alright without you. That shit hurts cause you don‚Äôt have a problem with that person‚Äôs happiness, but the fact that we are sad. We, too, should be happy, especially when this transition from being in the best moments to almost forgetting is unclear. But one must make efforts only until a certain point, after which you should not think of why that person left, but rather cherish the ones you have right now. At the same time, one must focus on oneself and aim at improving each day.",
      "‚ÄúSometimes things have to fall apart to make way for better things.‚ÄùThis was true for me as I found friends who helped me in my placement tirelessly, though they knew nothing about what turbulence I had in my head.",
      "On Day 2, slot 1, I was shortlisted for two straight interviews, about which I was confident, but I wasn‚Äôt able to give even a single round in both. As Day 2 slot 2 started, I gave interviews left, right, and centre and reached the last round in almost each of them but couldn‚Äôt crack them. My mother asked later that night, ‚ÄúHo gaya kya ?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúNahi, kal dekhta hu.‚Äù I could also feel the sadness in her tone as she said, ‚ÄúKoi na kal accha hoga‚Äù. I quickly ended the call by replying, ‚ÄúHa chalo, good night‚Äù, and I just broke down, and tears rolled down my eyes endlessly. But again, placement is a game of patience. I woke up the next day with new hope and zeal.",
      "Two of my friends, Anubhav and Harshit, were from another wing, and I used to go to their wing for random bulla or to ease off my stress. They got placed on day 2 when I wasn‚Äôt. The next day, they visited my room twice to check up on me and calm me down.",
      "The second time they came, I received a call from SPO about my confirmation of placement at Redseer, and they shouted more than anyone else. That‚Äôs what placement is about, but if you think that‚Äôs how placement ends, then you‚Äôre wrong.",
      "Hence for placement, all I can say is that study material is almost the same: coding, aptitude, case studies, etc. (depending on where you want to go), but the most important thing is friends. Make good people your friends, and at the same time be a good friend to them because the mental support these friends can provide at this crucial time, nobody can.",
      "The last sem was nothing short of a rollercoaster, where frankly, lows were low, and highs were damn high. I wouldn‚Äôt want to change a single event that happened to me this sem. I know this is hard to digest, but somehow, I was the luckiest guy. I met people who became family. We created moments and stories which are not the best for this AWL but will stay close to my heart forever. Two people to whom I want to express my gratitude are my friends Rohit and Nisha. They helped me in ways I can‚Äôt describe. They helped me get through the not-so-good phases of my life and never made me feel left out.",
      "There are few other notable mentions without whom this journey here at IITK wouldn‚Äôt have been possible: my C2 wingies, friends I got by my good luck ‚Äì Sonali, Samyak, Kohima, and Ayushi. Without them, I wouldn‚Äôt have known how you should manage time to maximize productivity(socially XD) and why bringing maggie at 2 in the night is important:-P.",
      "And yes, that‚Äôs the story of how I lived my life at IITK, it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but frankly, I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs ideal cause I would not want to change anything in this chapter of my life. The people it connected me with, the life lessons it taught, I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds or what kind of people I will meet, but I know that the future is promising.",
      "Tomorrow may be dark, and even the day after tomorrow might be filled with utter darkness, but the day after that shall be bright.",

      "",
      "Here I am not sharing my entire professional, academic and social life. You can easily glimpse it on different media platforms and archived articles by different student and institute bodies at IITK. Besides, it‚Äôs not feasible to write down everything out here. Maybe one-to-one interaction is more suitable.",
      "",
      "My primary focus here would be on some thoughts, crucial practices, and questions you should ask yourself often as you sail through your journey at IITK. These components form part of my thought framework, which I rigorously applied whenever I was in doubt or when I had to make a consequential decision.",
      "",
      "You can practically apply this to any situation or problem you face. It has worked quite well for me. I hope it helps you as well. Although, I would suggest you all build your framework questions and refine them with every failure, success, and unique experience you get along your way.",
      "",
      "Let‚Äôs begin! I would list out five components here and leave some parts of them open-ended. You can think over and fill them up on your own, based on your life experiences till now.",
      "What do you like? Make categories, and list them out.",
      "What do you want from your life? Maybe you don‚Äôt have an answer now, but keep thinking. What are your superpowers and privileges? Everybody has some of these. Identify!",
      "Are your current actions taking you towards or away from what you want?",
      "What are your constraints? Maybe your CPI, family conditions, or anything else. Think!",
      "Most of us are quite hesitant in our behaviour when we enter the campus. I believe it‚Äôs the system‚Äôs fault. We, as students, are rarely encouraged to ask questions or ask anything from anyone in general.",
      "But from my personal and my peers‚Äô experiences, the habit and courage to ask, what you want to ask and from the person you want to ask, is something that has exponential returns. It can disproportionately enhance your chances of success in any field you aspire for.",
      "",
      "On the other side, your ego pacifies you, that you can do things on your own. Maybe you can, but the reality is that it is practically much more difficult to discover things on your own. It is much easier to ask. So do reach out whenever you genuinely need anything. Never hesitate to ask for help.",
      "One truth you all need to accept is that life is unfair! We all are born under different circumstances, and we all have a different past, which decides our present and our future opportunities to some extent.",
      "But we all aspire for success like anybody else, disregarding the fact that we have different superpowers, privileges, and backgrounds. The only thing that can give you a considerable shift is a calculated risk!",
      "",
      "Never take a risk with a¬† downside that considerably harms your health, career, and your most important relationships. But if the downside is quite bearable, do go for it. In the present world, where things change so rapidly, the only strategy bound to fail is not taking any risks. So do take risks, bet on yourself, or lose your chance.",
      "From my personal experience, 80-90% of all worries which I had never actually happened. ML and AI have advanced, but the world is still highly unpredictable!",
      "Whenever in doubt about any crucial decision where you have to make choices, ask the following questions:",
      "What am I optimizing for?",
      "Is the choice a need or a want? There is a difference.",
      "How will this decision matter to me in the next 5-10 years?",
      "Will I regret not going for any of the options in the next 5-10 years?",
      "Is the choice a short-term instant gratification or a long-term beneficial sacrifice?",
      "There can be many more follow-up questions as well that you may add. The main crux is to try to think long-term. We highly underestimate the power of today‚Äôs decisions on our future.",
      "Now the last and final big question to ask yourself:",
      "Are you living your life the way you wanted to live? Or it‚Äôs the checkmarks of the society and your peer group which you are fulfilling to gain their acceptance?",
      "It‚Äôs hard even to realize that you are not living your own life, and it‚Äôs even harder to begin living your own life. You may have to start things again, lose friends, make new connections, and whatnot. But the final reward is even more pleasant than the pain of all the suffering you will go through. Finally, you may not need an escape because you will be in love with your life. You will be in charge of every moment of your life. It‚Äôs totally up to you!",
      "Optimize yourself every day. Academics, career, CPI, people, society, everything is essential, but not at the cost of your true well-being and happiness. Nothing will be worth it if you are not happy. Also, remember that you will never get everything in life. For every choice you make to have something, you also lose something. So next time, whenever you feel left out, try having a JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out) instead of FOMO (you know the full form).",
      "",
      "I hope thinking about these questions helped you get a better position and hold on to your life. All I would say is that it‚Äôs the best time for you to do experiments in your life. It‚Äôs totally fine even if you fail. Because by the time you fail, you would have already learned a lot more than those who did not dare to try! It‚Äôs your life, explore it, design it and start living it out on your terms.",
      "",
      "Finally, I would like to say that here at IITK, you have got one of the most precious slots of time to explore, experiment, and learn about your life. So, do use it efficiently. Believe in yourself because nobody else is going to do that for you. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. Everything else is secondary.",
      "With lots and lots of love and care!",

      "It was the chilling winter of January, the 4th semester of my degree when things changed for me. I started thinking about why I am here and what I am doing with my career. I started getting worried about where my life was leading. At the start of my IITK journey, I was an introverted boy who knew nothing about IITs, except that you get a high package job after graduating. I knew nothing about engineering except that there are a few branches, and you have to choose from them. When I came here, things were slightly different from my expectations. I was in a place where everyone was helpful and supportive in everything. Yet, somehow, I spent 1.5 years in my room doing nothing significant. I had a bad academic record. I had done nothing in any club or other activities. I had no idea what I wanted to do in my life.",
      "Then I started stepping out of my room and making friends. I started enjoying my coursework. That semester, I got an A grade for the 1st time ever, and the following summer, things started changing for me. NowI had ALL pass grades IITK offered on my grade sheet. Starting from a CPI of 5.1 in the 1st semester, I reached around seven just before my internship season. That summer, I explored research and UPSC. This exploration helped me plan my career somewhat by the end of the summer.It‚Äôs never too late to figure out anything.All of this was possible because I had a good network of people this time. Having a network of people always helps you, whether in academics or your problems in the professional world. So I guess the moral of the story is:",
      "In my 3rd year, I joined EC directly as a manager. There were a lot of challenges. Dear Recent batches, NO EC wasn‚Äôt the same always. It was a long way to go from changing the election system to building a team from scratch. And YES, I canPROUDLYsay weBUILTit.",
      "Working in a body that could punish students, we had many responsibilities. In the beginning itself, we failed; many things happened at that time. Many students were sent to SSAC, and the public reaction against us was apparent.You have to work for the people while they are criticizing you for the same.",
      "Soon, EC came up with a new system and started preparing for the General Election without any 4th-year members in our team. All of us were from 3rd year. Just one day before polling, we experienced something unique at an IITK; we faced a crowd of more than 50 people shouting at us, and we had heated arguments. At this point, when we were only a 3rd year and below student body conducting the election for the 1st time, we had to think about every word we said. Although there were more than 50 people, none of them was aggressive. It is the beauty of IITK that we had heated discussions and arguments, but no one went violent.",
      "Somehow we conducted that election, and that was the rise of a new election system at IITK. I became the CEO (Chief Election Officer), and COVID came; everything went online. I was ina position with administrative, executive, and judiciary powersin a single place. Usually, this is not the case with any system, but this is the most efficient that we can have with a student body. My idea for conducting an election is thatyou have to stop misconduct before it happens, and I was able to do that in the general election because of my team. They were just brilliant with their work. When600 people are live at 2 amto see the results of the polls, it means your team has done a brilliant job. Online elections wereone of the most engaging electionsthat I have seenin the history of IITK, and all of this success was because of the team. Everything changed during these 1.5 years in EC. We had a new system to conduct elections and a team truly dedicated to their work.",
      "It is easy for people to criticize the body because they are getting punished for their misconduct, and that‚Äôs fine. The people who know the body is right won‚Äôt speak up.But you must have the courage to hold a position attacked by the people you work for. You have to be honest about your job. No one knows what wrong you have done other than you, so you HAVE to be a man of integrity.",
      "I am not the only one who has gone through the feeling of losing people in their life or failing in love. I am sure many like me have lost people in their lives for some reason or sometimes without any reason. I have lost people at various stages of my IITK journey, and I have had new revelations every time. I have cried too much for the people, overthought many things, and countless times I tried to resolve things, but somehow things ended, somehow some things didn‚Äôt work out. You won‚Äôt always find a reason why things end. They just do. You have to move on after a point in time becausemoving on is life.",
      "The biggest lesson I learned in this journey is that you can‚Äôt be dependent on anyone. You have to be dependent on yourself only, and you have to understand that your happiness lies in you.You are the king/queen of your life.Don‚Äôt give this power to anyone. Don‚Äôt let them make you sad. But even keeping all these things in mind,never stop being social, always try to make new friends, step out of your room and do something. That something may be in academics, clubs, fests, anywhere.",
      "It‚Äôs OK to be sad sometimes. It‚Äôs also OK to cry sometimes for someone. Butdon‚Äôt forget that you have to be there for yourself.",
      "I am a big fan of Zakir Khan, so whenever I feel sad about relationships, I remember this line he said :",
      "Har Rishte ki ek umar hoti hai. Jab woh umar khatm hot hai toh wo rishta bhi khatm ho jaata hai. Isme koi sahi nahi hai, koi galat nahi hai, koi acha nahi, koi bura nahi hai, koi VILLAIN nahi hai. MAGAR TUM HERO HO.",
      "From the above paragraph, you may think my IITK life is like the life of Devdas, but it‚Äôs not true. I had lots of friends supporting me at every stage of my IITK journey. A wing that has always helped me whenever I needed them. They have always celebrated my happiness and supported me in my lows. A team that I call my family was with me, and lots of friends from my batch, seniors/juniors, without whom this journey wouldn‚Äôt have been possible. So, step out of your room, talk to people, and make friends that will make your life in IITK a memorable one.",
      "When I look back at my journey, I find that this place has given me things I haven‚Äôt even thought about. If I have to name the people am taking from this place with me, they would be; seniors who guided me and helped me figure out things, juniors who worked with me in EC and many who were not part of EC, my wingies who were always there for me, and some special people who helped me at my lows.",
      "I also take myself with me; this journey has evolved me into a person who has the confidence to face anything in this world.",
      "I call this place a goldmine; you can dig as much gold for yourself as you want, but you have to put some effort into finding gold.",

      "Kshitiz Chaurasiais a graduating Y18 student from the Department of Chemical Engineering. He explains how he handled various ups and downs during his stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It‚Äôs harder than I imagined penning down my journey at IITK, it makes me realize once again that it‚Äôs over.¬† Like most others, I arrived here expecting a voyage full of highs, only to discover that there are also lows. While we all want our lives to be perfect, it only takes one difficult discovery to realize that it never is. We all want something to change, something that would transform us into the perfect person we imagine ourselves to be, so it‚Äôs easy to feel like we‚Äôve failed if it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the frame of mind I brought with me, and it‚Äôs proven to be an annoyance several times throughout my journey. The graph of my journey turns out to be non-linear, there are lows and there are highs, and that I think is what makes for this beautiful rollercoaster ride.",
      "In retrospect, there are a lot of things I was able to accomplish while I was here and a lot of things I missed out on. Nevertheless, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn‚Äôt likely alter a thing.",
      "It was a sunny morning on 20thJuly 2018 when I stepped into IIT Kanpur as a student. What followed was a week of excitement I would never forget, and I doubt any of my batchmates can either. I remember my student guide telling me that this week would be something to cherish in my college life, and it turns out it really was.",
      "Unlike most of my peers, I was not thrilled about switching branches during my first year, nor was I eager about maintaining a perfect academic record. All I wanted to do when I started this journey was enjoy my time with my new friends. Everything went so nicely, from playing kabaddi on the Auditorium stage during orientation to hearing the H.R. Kadim story on the airfield (each word seemed full of gibberish, but surprisingly everyone believed it), that I didn‚Äôt miss home at all. My wingies, on the other hand, didn‚Äôt waste any time in transforming from strangers to family. Those late-night PUBG matches, with the relentless battle to score more damage than the next player, that loud laughter, the MVP tag, and that last chicken dinner consumed me for the first semester. For the Udghosh‚Äô18 competition, I also joined the institute handball team. Even though we didn‚Äôt win, I liked rehearsing with my friends every day for it, and it turned out to be a fantastic experience",
      "I didn‚Äôt bother studying much throughout my first year, like most of my close friends. Those late-night bulla sessions, along with ‚Äúek final round‚Äù of PUBG, didn‚Äôt allow me to focus on my academics, or even consider it. So, when I glanced at my first quiz copy, it was a hard blow in the face. However, my melancholy was short-lived when I discovered that my friends had comparable scores, so we naturally played more PUBG to relieve our collective pain. I studied for endsems at the study rooms in Hall 13 a week earlier. That those group study sessions finally turned into bulla sessions is an understatement, but it did allow me enough time to finish the curriculum. I was pleased with my 8+ SPI in the first semester, which I achieved with little work and while having fun. Then came the winters, and due to the Electronics Club‚Äôs workshop, I was able to have a few more friends, and I loved playing around with electronics devices during the workshop, despite the fact that the technical nuances always flew over my head, not that I paid attention anyhow.",
      "As the second semester approached, things began to spiral downward. I recall getting a dismal 5/60 on the MTH102 midterm exam. It was a rude awakening to have a score this low when most of my friends were in the mid-20s. Then it dawned on me that I might flunk this course, resulting in the loss of my MCM scholarship. I recall contemplating the possibility of dropping the course for quite some time. I eventually opted against it, preferring to work hard for the endsems. I started going to the NCL with my friends every day to study, and it was the first time I had genuinely studied since enrolling at IIT. As a result, I was able to preserve my 8+ CPI by scoring surprisingly well in endsems.",
      "Before long, all I could hear were individuals chatting about their plans for the summer. I recall how lonely the hallways were when most of my friends were back at home when I stayed here for the winters. Furthermore, I never felt like working on projects to add to my r√©sum√© or performing any competitive coding, so I decided to spend the summers at home. I‚Äôm not sure how things would have turned out if I had stayed, maybe I would have found a new social circle, or gotten more involved with the film club, and boosted my resume with some cool projects, but I think everything turned out fine in the end, even though my decision was rushed; there‚Äôs no point in dwelling on it now.",
      "When I arrived back on campus after the summer break, I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to give being engaged in extracurricular activities another shot. I became associated with Udghosh and Antaragni during the third semester, which I quite loved. Late night work for Udghosh with seniors in hall 1 turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than I had anticipated. Academics became a little easier when I stopped entirely disregarding it. I had some misgivings about ignoring extracurriculars during my freshman year, but I was able to come to peace with it. From coaching freshers for a film as an FMC secy to becoming a Workshop Manager at Techkriti, I tried it all. Then came the most trying period of our college life. When Covid struck, we had just gone home for mid-semester vacation, stranding us at home for an extended amount of time that lasted roughly two years. It was enjoyable at first, much like summer vacation, but I gradually began to dread campus life. My natural stance prevented me from studying or learning a new skill, so I spent my days playing video games or watching tv shows and movies.",
      "The campus started our fifth semester in online mode, as was to be expected, with a hazy promise to switch to offline mode as soon as it was practically practicable. Then came the internship season, which is known to be one of the most stressful times in a student‚Äôs life. I was aware that the choices I had made in the past may potentially have significant repercussions since I was left with a r√©sum√© that had no projects, just a few PORs, and nothing major. The only redeeming factor was my CPI. In the same vein as my friends, I simply worked on a few self-projects, diligently studied many ML courses on Coursera, and hoped for the best. I was fortunate enough to be shortlisted for a few well-known companies, but my nervousness caused me to perform poorly during the interviews. Nevertheless, I was aware that even if I was unable to secure an internship, I would not allow myself to become dejected. To say that the preparation for the internship was difficult and exhausting would be another way of understating the situation, especially when hadn‚Äôt done anything to be ready for it in advance. I remember having a conversation with a friend, where we discussed how improbable it is to land an internship and how it would be better to get some summer projects in the CSE department. Not much later I got shortlisted at another data science company. Despite the fact that my r√©sum√© did not highlight any particularly impressive projects, I was able to perform really well during the interview, which left a favorable impression on the hiring managers. In the end, I was successful in finding a decent internship, which marked the end of that stressful period. What followed were two exhausting and monotonous online semesters in one of which I received one of the lowest SPIs ever simply because one of our course instructors decided to send an email to our chemical department professors about rampant cheating by their students, prompting them to give all students the lowest possible grades. By the start of the placement season, I was lucky to still have 8+ CPI.",
      "Even if we all knew it was coming, the arrival of the resume submission email from SPO still managed to send cold shivers down our spine. It was time for an emergency meeting with my friends when we pledged to join the zoom call every day for coding sessions. Naturally, it didn‚Äôt happen as smoothly as we thought it would. I remember paying less and less attention to coding down the line as I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with any coding role. The administration happened to call us back in October, and with several reservations, I decided to go too. Upon reaching there, things didn‚Äôt go exactly as planned. I was allotted a room far away from my wingies, I wasn‚Äôt able to study for even a single hour for the initial week. After giving it a lot of thought, I decided it was best to return home for placement preparation. Soon placement tests began one after the other. I remember waking up at 6 for a placement test and by the end of the day, I would have given five tests. Fortunately, the interview phase didn‚Äôt last for long as I was able to get placed on day 1.",
      "We were all back on campus for our last semester. Despite the fact that covid cases were stacking up, I was overjoyed to see all of my friends on campus. I recall that our entire wing became infected, but we didn‚Äôt bother obtaining an RT-PCR test because it would involve temporarily relocating to the community center. We all chose to stay in our rooms and wait it out, and it only took three days to get everything back on track. I remember completely ditching studies and enjoying my last semester. In one final joyride of a semester, I managed to make a lot of memories by attempting everything I had wanted to do since my first year. I had made a pledge to myself not to spend too much time in my room, unlike in my first and second years, and I was able to keep that vow. I was able to cross several items off my to-do list from completing the arduous Kedarkantha hike to receiving two A*. Even though we didn‚Äôt get much study done, those all-nighters at the library were unforgettable. I was relieved that the endsems occurred offline because it meant we could study together diligently one more time. Those late-night hunger pangs with doaa canteen as a savior, and then hanging around the academic area for an hour just because we need one ‚Äú10-minute‚Äù short break, were all the moments I wish I could remember forever.",
      "The memories and happiness we find here are just irreplaceable. It involves those late-night walks with your most close friends, while one of you carries the speaker playing ‚Äúpahadon mein‚Äù on full volume. It is sharing the already cramped room that once seemed dreadful with the roomie of yours. It is lying down in your friend‚Äôs room for the whole day for no reason at all. It is shooting random embarrassing videos of each other and sharing them on the wing group. It is holding on to that tight hug with friends when you get placed, only to be awarded a GPL a few seconds later. It is strolling down the dark hallways of the academic area late at night discussing the meaning of life. It‚Äôs climbing up the trees in the academic area and being scared to death on the way down. It‚Äôs just you and your friend sitting in the RM building in silence for two hours after his first big heartbreak. It is randomly remembering and laughing hard on that shenanigan you pulled off a year back. It is that group zoom-call while you miss each other back at home during covid. It is arguing about the perfect dance move for the batch video. It is helping each other grow over time, and promising to stay in touch and meet regularly after graduation, even knowing deep in your heart it won‚Äôt happen. It is the final ‚Äúbabul ki duayein leti jaa‚Äù song playing while you are taking the final walk leaving campus after graduating while your friends carry your luggage behind you. It‚Äôs funny how those little things find their way to that deep corner of your heart and just manage to make their home there.",
      "As we leave, I make one final glance at the adventure I had. You don‚Äôt realize how hard it is to say goodbye until you are doing it yourself. There were times I wished for college life to end, there were times I was hopeless. But on the other hand, I experienced moments of absolute joy and occasions when I went outside my comfort zone. There might have been many downward shifts on this curve, but every minima has one beautiful thing about it: there is no way but up right after it. IITK taught me to embrace calmness in face of adversity as things will be better in no time.",
      "These four years are incomparable in terms of both their duration and their influence. It incorporates the memories, the ‚Äúek aur question kar lete hai‚Äù just one night before that 50% weightage endsem, that ‚Äúgaram frooti and thanda samosa‚Äù at NCC, that late night ‚Äúdoaa canteen waali chai‚Äù, and that painful GPLs. As much silly as it might have seemed in the first month, the words ‚Äúchaapu‚Äù, ‚Äúbakait‚Äù, ‚Äúmaggu‚Äù, ‚Äúfakka‚Äù, invoke more emotions than you may realize, and the fact that soon they would become distant hits hard. But birds aren‚Äôt meant to be caged, so fly we will.",
      "My final piece of advice to my juniors is to avoid trying to replicate someone else‚Äôs story. It‚Äôs entirely yours, and that‚Äôs what makes it unique. Your struggles, failures, and successes all boil down to one question: are you satisfied with it? So, try saying yes to things you would typically say no to because you are afraid of failing; you will be glad you did. Quoting Marianne Williamson, ‚ÄúBehind every fear, there is a miracle waiting‚Äù, so go find yours.",

      "The identity of the interviewee has been kept confidential by Vox Populi in order to safeguard their privacy.",
      "I will start my story from the time I was in school. My school life was rather ordinary, but the bullying I went through changed me as a person. Its severity varied, from being called slurs like ‚Äòmeetha‚Äô to being cornered by other students who would pass comments on the way I walked, talked, and essentially carried myself. All of it was traumatising for me. I did not have enough self-respect or pride to retaliate at that time, and I would go through all of it silently and try to correct the ‚Äôflaws‚Äô that were pointed out to me by my peers. I would have been okay if this was limited to my school and coaching, but when people would come outside my house to yell slurs at me, the entire thing became much more terrifying because I did not have any place where I could go to escape from all of this. Friends would keep asking me if there were any girls that I liked or why I hadn‚Äôt dated anyone, but I would always try to avoid such conversations. In 9th grade, I thought I liked a girl, and we dated for some time. Throughout the relationship, I realised that between us, was just an aesthetic attraction and I broke up with her soon after. The realisation that things were not working out with a girl was terrifying, and I was confused about my sexuality. But seeing the way my peers reacted even to the idea of someone not being heterosexual, I thought it was best to hide this part of myself. Even at home, homosexuality was looked at with disgust, and the overall environment felt unsafe. So, when I developed a crush on my best friend while preparing for JEE, I chose not to acknowledge my feelings, which was painful for me. Because of how things during my schooling were, I am only in touch with four people from school right now.",
      "After coming to college, I kept myself extremely busy during my first year. From Freshers to introductory sessions of any club that seemed even a tad bit interesting to Galaxy, I devoted most of my time to extra-curricular activities, and I loved it. I also volunteered at Unmukt because I was interested in educating myself about the LGBTQIA+ community. In retrospect, I might‚Äôve been keeping myself busy to avoid thinking about crushes and relationships and my sexuality. I remember, right after orientation, almost every single boy around me was talking about girls, objectifying them, talking about sex and whatnot.¬† I wasn‚Äôt interested in these discussions and tried my best not to participate, but when nudged with the question, ‚ÄúWho do you have a crush on?‚Äù To avoid any more questions, I would simply name any one of the popular girls whom many had a crush on. I remember having a crush on a senior, but I obviously could not admit to it because he was a guy. With all this chaos in my social life, I paid no heed to the clutter in my mind. The longer these feelings of confusion were left unaddressed, the more disturbed I started to become. Still, I chose to ignore these things because I was not ready to deal with the consequences of admitting to being confused. Why make my life more challenging when I can pretend that everything is fine, right? First-year was tough, both physically and mentally.",
      "When the lockdown got imposed, I finally had to face all these feelings that I had been suppressing for years, whether while studying for JEE or simply having a very active social life. The situation at home was not very good; I was not on very good terms with my father. The only time I would interact with my parents was during meals. I had started becoming more vocal about societal issues that troubled me, leading to disagreements and arguments. Lockdown had brought a sense of isolation, wherein I was left alone with the mess of my feelings, and the only option I had now was to think and sort things out. And that is what I did. I spent most of my nights overthinking and would always try to think of the possible endings of my coming-out story. That is if I ever chose to come out. I still was not quite sure what to label myself, or if I even wanted to label myself. With the ongoing pandemic, I became hyper-aware of my loneliness. I started feeling this need for a person, my person, and I really wanted this said person to be a boy. This realisation was very disturbing for me. Having seen how society reacted to anything that did not fit its idea of a relationship, I would try to picture scenarios in which I would end up having feelings for a boy, and would always come up with two possible courses of action:",
      "Whenever I would go down this train of thought, I would end up crying. After the first couple of months of lockdown, this had become a daily occurrence. Even if I tried to go out to freshen my mood, I would see couples doing their daily chores and being happy, and I would end up thinking about how I would probably never have this happiness in my life.",
      "This entire episode was very suffocating! All I wanted to do was talk to someone, to somehow let go of this weight I had been carrying around in my heart. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs and vent out all this sadness, but I had no one. I found my escape in movies. Specifically, queer movies. I would watch queer romcoms. Watching all these queer characters have happy endings made me feel hopeful about my own fate. It started with ‚ÄòCall Me By Your Name, which I initially thought was a romcom, but the ending broke me. As it turned out, I related more to this sad ending than I did with all the romcoms I was watching before. Thus began the tradition of watching sad queer movies every night. This phase gave me a temporary release from the suffocation that had been building up for years, but I eventually ran out of movies too, and now I was sadder, compared to the beginning of lockdown.",
      "I was still in touch with my best friend from school, whom I could talk with about anything, and both of us respected each other‚Äôs opinions. With this phase of sadness that only seemed to get more intense, I decided that I would come out to her. I remember how that conversation started off. I texted her at midnight, and started off with the classic ‚Äúlisten to whatever I am going to tell you, but please don‚Äôt let it ruin our friendship.‚Äù I was very hesitant, but I went forward with it. Her response was very comforting, and she made it very clear that she has no problems with my identity. Meeting her for the first time after this was pretty awkward, but things were back to normal in no time.",
      "I still wasn‚Äôt fine though. As a straight person she had quite idealistic views about queer issues, and she didn‚Äôt relate to them. I had to explain a lot of stuff to her, which I did not want to. This was because I myself could not accept this part of me completely and it became a reason for my poor mental health. Moreover, I had a whole storm inside my head and explaining or defending myself was mentally draining and exhausting. The last thing I wanted was to be questioned in those moments because I had already been doing that to myself for a pretty long time.",
      "After Unmukt, I had also started connecting with queer circles inside as well as outside campus and had managed to find a social circle where people could freely discuss their issues. By nature, I had always tried my best not to trouble people with my problems, but I decided to speak up about my problems, to feel some sense of relief. And it did make me feel better.",
      "Still, there was this unsettling feeling that all of this is an alternate reality since all this interaction was virtual. That the moment I stepped away from social media, I was back to the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô, where a boy-girl relationship was the norm, and being queer came with terrible consequences. But for now, this had to make do.",
      "During the lockdown, I decided to give Blued app a try, which is a gay dating app. My experience with the app was dreadful, to say the least. The main purpose of going on these apps for me was to find someone who I could talk to without any hesitation, who could relate to the kind of issues I was going through, and someone who would care about me. But most people on these platforms were only looking for hook-ups, and that was not something that I had expected, and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. To top it off, everyone wanted to be very private, almost anonymous, and the constant fear of having your identity leaked was very stressful. I had realised that it was more or less impossible for me to find something in line with my needs on dating apps. Thus I gave up on them. In retrospect, my discomfort towards these dating apps arose out of my internalised homophobia and my conditioning to feel disgusted by any sexual activity before marriage, especially when it is between men. With time, by educating myself, by the practice of learning and unlearning and interacting with people, I have defeated a major part of my internalized homophobia. I also do not see sex in a derogatory manner.",
      "Around the same time, I was still talking to my best friend from coaching, whom I once had a crush on. His openness toward discussions, made me feel that maybe we could be together. After a long time, I felt that I should confront him about my feelings. Having a serious crush on your best friend is often upsetting because upon confessing there are usually two possibilities ‚Äì you can either get into a relationship, or your friendship will be ruined. The third possibility, however unlikely, is that both of them are mature and they put in enough effort and maintain the bond, which is not easy. While I ended up confessing to him, it did not work out ‚Äì thus I ended up losing his friendship. The trauma that followed still haunts me ‚Äì it took away my confidence to ask someone out and rebuilding my morale took a lot of time. This experience gave me a clear realization that my love life is not going to be as easy as that of heterosexual people. The reason I was rejected was because of my body, that I am a man and for the first time in my life, I cursed my body and God. I felt alone, and nothing seemed to replace that loneliness. That loneliness was and still is suffocating.¬† People told me that my life was set, just because I was studying at IITK ‚Äì unaware of what was really going on inside my head. I had realized that the chances of having a good ending are insanely low and to live with this realization every day is draining and often made me suicidal. I have to fake it all, act like everything is okay, put on a fake smile and just‚Ä¶.pretend.",
      "I had also been active in terms of showing my support for the LGBTQAI+ community on social media, whether it was by posting stories, joining Facebook groups, or connecting with people and getting to know about their experiences. This made me the perfect target for a certain faction of people on campus, who enjoy hating on anything and everything they can hate on. These people expected me to defend every absurd accusation and answer every question they had regarding the movement. In an attempt to ridicule me, one of my acquaintances first asked me in a mocking tone, if the pride parade participants are ‚Äòchhakke‚Äô. The same people started calling me out with names such as ‚Äòchhakka‚Äô, ‚Äògay‚Äô, ‚Äòmeetha‚Äô and whatnot in a derogatory tone. During the pride month, one of my wingmates asked me what it was in a mocking tone, and another wingmate replied with answers like ‚Äúthis is the only time when they feel proud!‚Äù,¬† ‚ÄúThisis the only time they have when they do lots and lots of sex.‚Äù, and ‚Äúthis is the time when they are allowed to feel proud and respectful‚Äù, and laughed about it. Another wingmate of mine ridiculed the LGBTQIA+ community by addressing them as ‚ÄúLGTV Folks‚Äù, ‚ÄúLGBT L*uda L*ssan People‚Äù etc. In my wing, I had identified three or four people who were the ones who passed these comments and tried to provoke me. The others were understanding when I would talk to them in person but were too hesitant to speak against those select three-four people. They did not want to cause fights in the wing, even if it meant that they were choosing to be a part of a group that was creating a toxic environment for marginalised communities on campus.",
      "A few months back, after returning to college, I had painted my nails pink, and was really happy with the way they looked. I went and showed it to few of my wingmates, who always claimed to be allies. The moment they saw my nails, one of them grabbed my hand, crushed my fingers, and mockingly said they wished to cut them off. To them it didn‚Äôt seem to be a big deal but I was shocked and ran into my room and started removing the nail paint with sanitiser because I did not even have a nail-paint remover.¬† Soon after, we got to witness the Valentine‚Äôs week when the privilege of the heterosexual people was at display in the form of dates, exchanged gifts, chocolates and roses ‚Äì where everyone was enjoying a ‚Äònormal life‚Äô. People often don‚Äôt understand how fortunate they are. I feel this need to clarify everything I do or don‚Äôt. I have to make sure that my actions are not too ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô or give away this part of my identity. I constantly have to hide my phone and laptop. If I‚Äôm giving my phone to someone, I have to make sure that they see nothing that reveals everything to them, that my character does not break and that I don‚Äôt cause a problem. I try to be very strong, I try to stand for myself and my pride, but after a point, I lose it all, and valentine‚Äôs night was one such night when I broke down.",
      "I have a lot of queer friends with whom I can rant a lot, and I can share things, but I‚Äôve always respected people‚Äôs boundaries so I tried not to bother them much. It was suffocating no doubt, but I was glad to have them around. So there are friends with whom I generally connect. I realised that a lot of people have the same kind of stories, and they are using education and career as a solution, because when you have that stability, you have the power to deal with such rubbish and shitty things, and it acts as a backup, that if everyone leaves you, you still have materialistic support. So when I finally decide to come out to people, that would be at a point when I‚Äôm financially and socially independent.",
      "Back at home, it was a bit triggering, but being in college is better because you‚Äôre alone, yes, but you also have the freedom, and it‚Äôs easier to be invisible here. In general, in my life, I do not like being a¬† topic of discussion ‚Äì whenever I enter a room, people expect me to have some discussion about LGBTQ issues. I am challenged to defend and speak for myself on several related topics with baseless arguments being relentlessly thrown at me. People need to understand that ‚ÄòSexuality‚Äô is just a small part of me, not my whole personality and I really want to enjoy and explore this part of mine, but constant questioning pulls me down and dismantles me piece by piece. I‚Äôm generally up for healthy respectful discussions but at times I feel like I can‚Äôt fix everything, not if they‚Äôre unwilling to learn. In the end, it‚Äôs not healthy for me to take the responsibility for educating others. I am not Google but google can actually do wonders.",
      "I cannot come out to the whole world right now, because even though my wingmates are intolerant, being in the company of these people is better than being alone. Also, considering the situation in my family right now, I am not sure if they will accept this part of me, and I am not ready to lose these connections. So, I speak half-truths. When asked about marriage, I say that I don‚Äôt want to marry a girl without mentioning that I want to marry a boy. I don‚Äôt hide my tracks anymore. In the end, even though I can not come out to everyone, I feel extremely exhausted and have become numb towards what other people are perceiving of me. As of now, I have come out to a few trustworthy friends, and am actively trying to learn about LGBTQ issues and now even trying to learn more about intersectional feminism. So yes, life is not so bad right now and I am still quite optimistic for my ‚ÄòCall Me By Your Name‚Äô moment, but one with a good ending!",

      "An alumnus of IIT Kanpur (2003), Prof. Akshaya Kumar is an Assistant Professor in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Indore. He did his Ph.D. in Film and Television Studies from the University of Glasgow, UK. His research Interests involve Bhojpuri cinema and the nuances of Media Studies.From being a Materials and Metallurgical Engineering undergraduate at IITK to being a researcher in the field of Bhojpuri Cinema, we take a look at his scholarly journey and his transition to Humanities in the article.",
      "1.What was that turning point during your engineering degree that motivated you to pursue research in films as a full time career?",
      "I entered IIT Kanpur just like most of the undergraduates who crack JEE, after years of struggle with themselves and with expectations around them. Then, you enter a new system, expect great things from a great institution, and meet people from very different backgrounds. In that sense, my journey was very similar to anyone else.",
      "However, shortly afterwards, you begin to see disappointments emerge. At least I did. It takes you a while to realize that you are not the only one. It takes more than two years to realize that many of us are in the same boat. The fact that you cannot cope, it is not giving you the kind of pleasure that education has given you all throughout your life, and it‚Äôs not what you thought it would be ‚Äì these are all the emotions you struggle with privately. They are the ones that you accumulate and work with for a long time while behaving as if everything is perfectly fine.",
      "I was in the same boat. After a while, you realize a majority of us are in this boat. We are disappointed not getting what we came here for and so on. Maybe we need to find a different route and work something out eventually.",
      "To put it simplistically, it becomes a journey of two halves. The first half is this reconciliation and realization, going from a personal disappointment to building public solidarity around it. Also, overcoming the fact that others think you are not good enough to be here. Over a period of time, the metric of peer evaluation expand, and your peers learn to respect you for attributes outside the common perception. It does take a while for hard-wired and competitive batchmates to appreciate you outside your academic performance. Then in the following half, things begin to take a different shape.",
      "I isolated myself towards the second half of the third year because I was really in the thick of things. You guys are perhaps unaware of Galaxy and how politically intense IIT Kanpur used to be in terms of student activity. I was deeply involved in all those things. While disappointment in academics was taking shape, it‚Äôs not that one was sulking and sitting in a corner. The rejects of the system eventually get together to realize that they are in unquestionable majority, and there is a resounding legitimacy to their collective disappointments. Of course, you are also in the thick of various activities, you are enjoying it, but at the same time, you are thinking about what a different future could look like. In the second half of my stay there, I began to prefer more solitude, and worked on aspects of my personality that needed refinement. That‚Äôs when films crept into my system, and interesting ideas began to ferment.",
      "2.What was your journey of film exploration and appreciation like? Did you first start appreciating films from an academic perspective through courses or via some club you had joined, like films or dramatics club, that gave you a bend in your trajectory?",
      "I think it was called SFS back then. It was a Student Film Society that I was associated with from the first year itself. But I didn‚Äôt come from a background where I had any exposure to international cinema. I still remember watching Godfather for the first time in the auditorium and wondering what the hell it was all about! If you don‚Äôt have a background in appreciating or understanding cinema, it is not common sense, and it takes a while to appreciate it.",
      "I think the real breakthrough happened with the Internet. I joined in ‚Äô99. It‚Äôs the year the Internet really broke through in India. Around 2001, the bandwidth we had in IIT Kanpur was probably quite exceptional in the whole country. And films weren‚Äôt my singular pursuit. I remember my seniors who had built a collection and hosted exciting FTP servers. Communities were built around shades of film appreciation. In the beginning, of course, it is more about ‚ÄúOh, this guy really likes this film,‚Äù so let me catch up; but when I watched that film, I mostly didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. There are some such films that you begin with. You watch a movie, and you say no, this simply didn‚Äôt click with me, so you go on the Internet and try to read about it. It doesn‚Äôt begin academically, but when you take a deeper interest in something. Mostly, the first few films don‚Äôt lead to a major breakthrough, one must ease into the process. Still, maybe with one of those films, it clicks when you read about it! You can suddenly see what you couldn‚Äôt see over those two and a half or three hours. You suddenly view it in a different light, and that‚Äôs magnificent ‚Äì you wake up to the power of cinema.",
      "I think it began just like that. The SFS film screenings were very not helpful to me. What turned things around was more of a private activity, where you sit in front of a desktop and watch films non-stop for long hours, and some of those films seem magical, and then you discuss them with your friends. The academic side of the interest comes from very private motivations. I don‚Äôt think we had a community around discussing and appreciating films. It was just the fact that there was so much material available to you through the Internet that you could learn; also including petty stuff, such as downloading subtitles. We didn‚Äôt speak English very fluently, so most of us didn‚Äôt understand Hollywood films easily. Subtitles were a big deal, once I found them! These were things we never even knew had existed. By now, I think it‚Äôs all elementary Internet awareness. Back then, it took me an entire day to figure out the best video player to run subtitles with the film, adjust the time-lag in subtitles and change font-colors etc. A lot of these things were learned privately. These may be petty issues, but they made the route to international cinema accessible.",
      "3.Alumni across various fields boast of the impact that the education at IITK had on their professional lives, which helped them grow and succeed eventually. What role, if any, has IITK‚Äôs technical education played in shaping your understanding of humanities and your research career so far?",
      "I would be lying if I said that a lot of my technical or otherwise learning came from the Academic Area. I think most of it came from outside the academic area. I think that becomes obvious to you as an IITK student in the first and a half years. It does however make a difference as to which department in IITK you went to at what point in time. Remember, we are talking about ‚Äô99, the time of the IT boom. So anyone from the Electrical or CSE would have a totally different experience. They would learn technical skills that would be instantly useful in their lives, or at least their careers.",
      "For the remaining departments, there was a sense of doom on the core learning aspects, to a great extent. There was a feeling that we were doing something incommensurate with the times ‚Äì perhaps even irrelevant. My department was Materials and Metallurgical Engineering. A particular aspect of that core learning was relevant to steel-making. Still, one struggled to find much excitement about the relevance of steel-making, the industry, and where one could fit in there. In that sense, we all felt that we were doing something that was not so desirable, and this added to the alienation. So, hardcore technical education isn‚Äôt something I took much interest in. Neither did most of my batchmates, as far as I remember.",
      "Of course, a huge proportion of the learning came from outside the arena of technical education. The thing that affected me the most was that some batchmate you met in the first year, who may have seemed rather ordinary, really turned a corner around the third year. People had grown so much as individuals. Exceptional talent exists on IIT campuses, which was especially on display in Galaxy, where people did miracles. Sometimes just witnessing those miracles felt special. Realizing what and how much you can do, and how little your struggles in the academic area matter was very significant. Towards the end of the program, you see people going places, so some of that magnificent talent one witnessed was realized straightaway. But in my case, just finding my feet took six years.",
      "I passed out in 2003, and my Humanities journey began in 2009. So there was a long gap during which I worked at a steel plant and then in the Software industry; also, I traveled a lot across the country. The shift to Humanities was not something I had in any corner of my mind when I left IITK.",
      "4. Being from a technical background, did you ever feel overwhelmed when you started out to occupy the same stage as those already having a BA and MA degree, which is a strong foundation in the field of humanities?",
      "In 2009, I joined JNU for a Master‚Äôs in Arts and Aesthetics. Most of my batchmates there and the students one met across Delhi had done at least three years of a BA program. It‚Äôs not like you won‚Äôt feel the weight of those extra years. People had read so many core texts, they knew how to build and present an argument, and they knew how to read copious amounts of text. As engineering students, we are used to solving problems. We are not used to reading and extracting value from reading texts. That itself takes time. Although I had built a reading habit over the interim six years, the gap in core habits and skills still hit me hard. It was overwhelming, and I was as troubled as anyone else would be. Then it‚Äôs another matter how you work things out ‚Äì whether you read more, or concentrate on some key focus areas. You know your disadvantages, so you need to learn how quickly you can extract value while competing with those around you. Of course, I had been through the rigors of the education system, as anyone joining the IITs would. So I was aware that I had the skills and ability to make sense of ideas, as long as I participated in the grind.",
      "5. Your thesis at Glasgow university explored the explosive growth of Bhojpuri cinema alongside the vernacularisation of north Indian media. We would love to understand the development of your fascination towards Bhojpuri cinema and the thought that went behind choosing this topic for your thesis.",
      "I have received many interesting comments on my thesis-work through the research career. But one of the first things you realize after entering academia is that the ‚ÄúQuality of your topic does not determine the quality of your research.‚Äù You can write a brilliant thesis on sleaze, about pornography, about anything, and just because the thesis is about sleaze, it does not become a bad thesis. To deliver a good thesis, you need to do solid research work, which is fundamentally about analytical insights, not merely describing the material. Even though this is a plain fact, it takes time to reconcile with it. I began my doctoral research in 2012, but my interest in the subject began during my Masters at JNU. There was a Seminar course with six students in that class. The idea of the course was to develop a mini-dissertation around any subject of your choice; for me, that‚Äôs where it started. Generally during MA programs, the design is teaching heavy; you don‚Äôt get time to think about further research. The suggestion about researching Bhojpuri cinema came from a classmate. I was not very convinced about it till I came across the book by Avijit Ghosh, published in 2010; that‚Äôs where I began to make sense of the complexities criss-crossing within the subject.",
      "Bhojpuri films have been around since the 1960s, but what we now identify as Bhojpuri cinema, a particularly recent variant, emerged in 2003. The way to this period of Bhojpuri cinema goes via the explosion in the popularity of Bhojpuri music, which started in the 1980s with the coming of audio cassettes. Among various other vernacular forms, Bhojpuri song cassettes and later music videos became very popular and led to the emergence of numerous singer-performers out of which came the crop of film actors. Key to these transitions are the overlap between music and film industry, the coming of the multiplexes, the slow decline of single-screen theatres where Bhojpuri films started to make a grand appearance, and the working class people who came from the Bhojpuri speaking region to cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Nashik, Ludhiana. There is a lot that can be said here about urban reconfiguration, the suburban vs. urban conflict and labor migration from northern and eastern India towards western and peninsular Indian. But the foremost issue with Bhojpuri popular culture has been the gender question. So, when you go to any theatre playing Bhojpuri films, there is no female presence anywhere. Among other aspects, one of the core issues in my research has been the history of all-male working-class audiences engaged in the scandalous exhibition of female bodies.",
      "But at the same time, I also observed that many people watching these films are there just to relax and unwind with the cheapest mode of public entertainment available. They may just go to sleep in the film theatre. It is, after all, a leisure palace available in the heart of the city with affordable entry tickets. So, the interest in all these aspects of cinema‚Äôs intersection with leisure, infrastructure, desire, migration, labor and gender began in 2011 at JNU, and then I carried it forward to Glasgow as my Ph.D. research.",
      "6. We have learnt that any form of research is carried out in quest for some knowledge or truth. Looking at the engaging topics of your research papers, we would love to understand first: Whatmakes a particular topic of your research interesting to you, what is your vision associated with your choice of topics in your work?Also,How did your academic research help in your understanding of society?",
      "In academia, some of this gets done automatically because you are often working on multiple papers together. Also, you put some of the papers on hold, when you feel you don‚Äôt have the momentum or enough substance at the moment. So, the most recent paper that I published, on caste in a Marathi film,Sairat, took me five years and was rejected multiple times. So a lot goes into the process of academic publishing, revisions in particular, which itself is a long drawn process. A core understanding of society comes prior to this, primarily from reading, teaching, learning from your peers, learning from your seniors; the understanding of the truth that you seek happens more organically than what a research paper can show you. Research papers are fundamentally about your core expertise and training. But there are times when one experiments with new areas, ongoing debates or different styles. Academic publishing, however, has its own complexities which make the experimentation more arduous and perhaps even unrewarding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just bureaucratic, complex, and often petty, like everything else in life.‚Äù",
      "The aspects of society you want to wrestle with emerge more organically, not just in academic dialogue, but in conversations with peers, students and during informal chatter around conferences. When you find a productive solidarity with other scholars, that‚Äôs when you know you may be ready to work towards an argument. For example, I‚Äôve written a paper onSatyamev Jayate, a series which a friend of mine really loved and I absolutely hated for some reasons. Our debate spurred me on to work out an academic critique, which I thoroughly enjoyed writing of course. So, it takes a lot of time to organize and structure your thought process in such a way that is worthy of academic scrutiny.",
      "7.In modern times, research is often perceived as an instrumental thing. In this existing climate of instrumental/ ‚Äôtangible product‚Äô based research, how do you envision the importance of humanities research in engineering schools?",
      "Engineering/STEM and Humanities research works in somewhat contrasting ways. Natural sciences tend to have a strong recency bias and therefore create a vertical pile of publications, in which only the top-portion, which has been or can be instrumentalized more easily, matters. The Humanities are spread a lot more horizontally, and can appear dated and irrelevant to students trained in such a modality. But more importantly, the instrumentalizing part comes from the ranking systems in which institutions, personnel, labs and departments are all entangled in a vertical system. In this system, students position themselves by selling one institutes‚Äô rank to another for higher studies. Often in this transaction across technical institutes, the role of Humanities and research is a non-issue; Humanities are instrumentalized just for the sake of diversity. What Humanities otherwise brings to the table is an environment different from this process. Also, what the undergrads are often taught are hardly topics of much research consequence; very often, it‚Äôs about basic blocks of critical Humanities thought. Research is something that comes into the picture only if you want it, with personal and sustained motivations. STEM tends to be a lot more collaborative, hierarchical and centered around power relations. There is a lot of hierarchy in Humanities, too; one needs to understand that research has always been tied to power. Institutions are themselves manifestations of power, but global ranking systems create more transactional networks. So if somebody is doing good research outside the elite quarters of the academy, and is seen as a valuable addition to the brand value, they are often bought even across continents. This is how academic transactions work, regardless of Humanities or STEM. Therefore, the question is how technical institutes can continue to avail of competitive global rankings and the deeply hierarchical systems of institutional power, while also allowing the Humanities‚Äô critical thinking to flourish beyond mere embellishments. The two can‚Äôt easily go together, and that is why those teachers in the Humanities who try to offer critiques of power are often seen as soft alternatives to hard ‚Äúrealities‚Äù. Personally, I think there are no limits to what the students can learn from both Humanities and STEM, or to how they reconcile otherwise irreconcilable approaches, but I‚Äôm not hopeful about whether institutes themselves are capable of being sensitive to those critiques, let alone inserting them into program/curriculum design.",
      "8. With the introduction of National Education Policy in 2020, we are expecting an increased emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach in imparting education in India, wherein students will be encouraged to study subjects from different disciplines simultaneously thus removing the existing rigid separation between them. What in your view, will be the impact of such kind of education on future technocrats that our colleges shall produce?",
      "I think there‚Äôs a strawman thesis being projected to sell us false dawns and horizons. Interdisciplinarity is nothing new or pathbreaking. What students are sold every few years is a shifted goalpost of disciplinary promiscuity. But interdisciplinarity works only when academic trajectories are designed to support it downstream from undergraduate education. In 2009, I did my Master‚Äôs in Arts and Aesthetics at JNU, which was an amalgamation of 3 disciplinary streams, and a lot of students were left terribly confused and lost by the end of the program. Almost two-third of them would have preferred a conventional Master‚Äôs program, because those who didn‚Äôt want to pursue a PhD immediately didn‚Äôt understand where else the learned skills may be applicable. I don‚Äôt think there is any rigid separation between disciplines anyway, and it is unlikely that the new guidelines, proposals and vision documents will fundamentally change anything.",
      "9. If you were given a time machine to travel to your¬† first year of IITK, what insight would you like to share with your younger self ?",
      "If you‚Äôre as disappointed with your IIT education as I was in the very first year, you have the conventional option of managing somehow or the nuclear option to leave. The problem is not leaving as such, but the paucity of realistic alternatives available to someone fully committed to a career in sciences or technology. In light of that, I would only advise to make the most of being a legitimate participant of the privileges that make IITs special. The fact is, like in Test cricket when you come to the international stage for the first time, the first thought that crosses your mind is whether I even belong here. All you need is to convince yourself of that, set aside the prior expectations, and make the most of what you have. In some way, you know you‚Äôll benefit from being where you are, but you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre allowing yourself the best chance to extract those benefits. That is what you need to learn from your peers and seniors. The only thing I would suggest to my younger self is that you‚Äôll befine, don‚Äôt worry too much about it. Shed that anxiety, don‚Äôt try to map the future; it will figure itself out. This is precisely the track I began treading in the last quarter of my stay.",

      "Yogeshwar Ken is a Y17 undergraduate student from the Department of Chemical Engineering. He talks about how everything ended well, despite a lot of downs in his stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I was waiting for someone from my wing to write anAs We Leavebecause our wing has had a unique journey in the last four years. This piece of writing is kind of unorthodox from the conventionalAs We Leave.",
      "Most members of our wing came to college with a complacent mindset. We thought, now that we have qualified JEE, there is no need to study anymore in college and that college is meant to have fun only. Even the few, who came with the attitude to learn, changed in that environment and brought homogeneity to our wing.",
      "I remember it was the first quiz of MTH101 (and the first quiz on the campus); I got only three marks out of 15; I never got this low in my school/coaching life. I was distressed, but when I reached the wing, I found that many people got even less than three. So that gave me a sense offalse comfort ‚Äìcomfort that I am not doing badly; everyone is in the same boat.",
      "After Mid-sem results, many of us got tensed, that maybe we will fail in some subjects in this semester. Yet, a person used to tell us that‚Äúmaine ek senior se pucha tha, fail to koi hota hi nahi hai, to chinta ki koi baat nahi‚Äùand we blindly believed that. Finally, the result of the first sem produced a drastic CPI for almost all of us. I can give you some CPI numbers- 1.0, 2.1, 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 4.5, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5 and many more. (Although we also got a 10 pointer)",
      "After that screwed up result, there was a wing meeting (emergency meeting :D). Most of us decided that our low CPI is due to attending morning classes, and professors are just wasting our precious time. So we all quit going to classes. And started to sleep in the day. And have group study sessions, which generally changed into bulla sessions most of the time. No wonder, the result didn‚Äôt get any better in the 2nd sem, but our bonding certainly did. When other wings were busy calculating how manyDassasthey have in their wing, we used to calculate how manyBacklogswe have in the wing. And that number was above 50 after the 2nd sem.",
      "As a result, many of us started facing problems due to our low CPI in joining clubs, availing scholarships, and other such things at IITK, after our first year. It is then that all of us suddenly started taking academics seriously.",
      "Cut to present times, that is after the completion of the last sem, the person who got CPI 1.0 in the first sem, now has CPI more than 7.5. And most of us have managed to get around seven.",
      "The message I want to convey to my juniors here, is that it‚Äôs never too late to focus on your academics. If you have screwed your CPI till now, it can certainly get better in the future, provided you start putting in efforts right now.Jab jaago tabhi savera!",
      "I was in love with a girl from my coaching when I came here. Things were pretty good at the start, but I think the long-distance ruined everything- constant fights on useless topics and a lot of wastage of time and energy. I didn‚Äôt want to lose her, as she was my only friend from Delhi, with whom I was in constant touch. I used to share my things with her and used to talk with her for hours. All this came to a sudden and brutal end. I could not bear it. I was in mental trauma for almost 5 to 6 months, but no one knows about this (until now lol). I kept hiding my feelings from all, maintaining a happy face in front of all like aneccedentesiast.",
      "But that didn‚Äôt get me anywhere. So, finally, I decided to open up to my roommates about all this stuff. They understood my situation and helped me figure out the aspects which I was not able to see.",
      "I just told this short, corny ‚Äòlove-story‚Äô here to tell you the importance of opening up in front of your friends (choose them wisely!). We all get into such tough phases in our lives, either due to failing in internships, placement or family problems, love, and others; Hence, it‚Äôs always good to open up to someone.",
      "I was placed after my 35th interview! And for those of you who don‚Äôt know, let me tell you that it‚Äôs certainly a substantial figure; I know most people are fed up with 3-4 interviews during the placement season. I had my first shortlist for an interview on day 2, slot 1, and after that, I got shortlisted in every slot. During phase one, before every interview, I searched for my mistakes of the last one so that I don‚Äôt repeat them; still, I could not figure out where I was going wrong. On day 7, my whole wing was placed except me. There was massive pressure on me to get an offer, but I had a different fate; I didn‚Äôt get a job offer in phase one.",
      "Many people started mocking me except my wing peeps- they always supported me. Many of them constantly gave me hope that I will also get an offer. But the same stuff was repeated in the 2nd phase of placement- I got shortlisted and eliminated in the last rounds.",
      "I started spending my whole day on LinkedIn, and got many rejections were from there as well. After March, I lost hope in getting a placement at IITK and made peace with this fact. I was trying to figure out possibilities for the future, what I should do next, my parents discussed the same with me all the time. That was a very unpleasant time, but as one person said to me, ‚ÄúIn the end, everything is going to be fine.‚ÄùI always sleep, thinking about that, and on 20th April (almost the last days of the 2nd phase), I got an offer from SPO and two offers off-campus on the same day.",
      "The feeling that day was surreal and probably cannot be described in the petty words I have in my vocabulary.",
      "When I look back and try to figure out what I got from this place, I can say, a good set of friends, from my wing, department, hall, and other halls, with whom I used to share jokes, trying to make them laugh. I was a part of VOX and SOS, which gave me a great experience about social structures. I enjoyed playing cricket, badminton, good-evil, card games, Pictionary, and a hell lot of other games (I did tell you about my wing, no?!).",
      "Countless sleepless nights, mugging all the courses in one night and having parties on the other nights.The fests, especially the Antaragni Nights. Chilling with friends on the rooftop of OAT, exchanging words in a vast social circle, and meeting great and unique personalities (in my opinion, everyone at IITK has a unique and diverse personality, and you can learn from them).",
      "I‚Äôd like to give my 2 cents to the juniors: try to make a significant social circle in IITK. It will help you in your life in pretty much all aspects.",
      "The last three days at the campus were warm, everyone was emotional, and I cried for almost 15 to 18 times. Everyone was leaving the campus one by one. I had my train on the last day (which I couldn‚Äôt board :p but that‚Äôs a different story). So I saw all of my friends off, and every time I said the last goodbye to them, my eyes were filled with tears because every friend on the campus means a lot to me, and they are the best ‚Äòassets‚Äô I have in life. I came here for an IITK tag/degree, but IITK gave me a family and for this, I‚Äôd be forever indebted to my alma mater!",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "The biggest challenge in describing my IIT Kanpur Journey was putting it all in a single article. These four years were a long journey, and many memories sparkle when I look back on it all.",
      "Being one of the people who hadn‚Äôt done much except studies during school, I faced a real setback in my initial days. I couldn‚Äôt find a new interest, while my only interest ‚Äì maths, was being destroyed day by day as lectures of MTH101 were proceeding. I tried shots at everything during Gymkhana week ‚Äì but got nothing.",
      "During Takneek, I pitched a poster idea to our then HEC President. He liked that idea and asked me to fair out. Somehow on the 5 inches of my phone, with Adobe Draw (sad they are discontinuing it soon), I made the Takneek poster for my Hall, and it looked good according to my-then standards.",
      "‚ÄúOK, so I design well‚Äù. This thought started a streak of ideas, and I continued making posters on my phone (laptops then weren‚Äôt allowed in the first sem). One thing led to another, and then one day I was asked if I‚Äôd be able to design the manifesto for a Presidential Candidate in the upcoming GE2018. It seemed like a great opportunity back then, so I learnt Adobe Illustrator during my winter break and then as soon as I was back on campus, I started working on the manifesto. It took me 20 days to complete the whole thing ‚Äì though it was a fair design, what changed my outlook fully was the knowledge (Imagine a first year guy reading the manifesto content of a President twenty times while editing). The potential of student bodies on the campus inspired me (more on that later).",
      "Once I started getting credits for my designs at Vox, which I joined soon after elections, I made it a must to be credited for my designs. And back then when DnA Club didn‚Äôt exist, I was one of the people who was approached for any and every kind of design. I have designed things for clubs, friends and internships ‚Äì things as mainstream as posters, logos (the logos 3 out of 9 SnT teams ‚Äì ERA, Aerial Robotics and VISION are my creation), manifestos (in almost every general elections), hoardings and as offstream as TA project reports, research posters or even dotted alphabet pads for nursery kids in 5 different Indian languages. I still remember, a a Y12 alum at BCG asked me to design a photo frame for their boss on Antaragni ‚Äò18 day 1. For completing it on time, I was compensated so well that I could try almost all different varieties of foods at nearly every stall in the four days, with my plus one. During my internship at SIIC, I designed and branded their annual event Abhivyakti end to end, which was a great learning experience for me as a designer.",
      "If you‚Äôd ask me two and a half years back, for me design was everything. But, as remarked by Tony Stark, ‚ÄòA part of the journey is the end‚Äô. And one day, when a senior-cum-wellwisher, in his typical about-to-give-a-funda tone, asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be 10 years ahead, Snehil, an awesome designer or Snehil, someone with many skills and remarkably good at design?‚Äù This led me to a deep introspection. Yeah, my design was good, but did I really want to take it to a level where the visual satisfaction compares to that of the feeds of Behance/Dribbble ‚Äì NO. To which he advised ‚Äì then stop it right there for some time and explore other things. You can come back later, but stop it for now. And, I left Design there ‚Äì just like that. All the plans, all the ideas ‚Äì hired design interns and delegated the existing work to them, made sure that none of my work in the future has design as a mainstream work responsibility and even removed all Adobe Apps from my taskbar (It was a big step for me). I then, explored many different work profiles, through PoRs or interns, for short term projects ‚Äì Marketing, Media and Publicity, Strategy, Event Management, UI/UX, Web Development etc. ‚Äì and wherever I could ‚Äì I used or contributed my design skills. I, not only got me a taste of learning different things but remained engaged. And in this exercise ‚Äì over time, I realised that I am into building software products ‚Äì the visuals, the UI, the UX, the design, the functionality, the code ‚Äì the frontend, the backend ‚Äì everything intrigued me. And this was really insightful ‚Äì as while applying for jobs off campus ‚Äì I clearly knew what I am looking for.",
      "Did I leave design ‚Äì definitely not. Even though today I am not in a design role ‚Äì I keep contributing to the design team at my workplace, giving some suggestions here and there and learning more from the product designers here.",
      "During my first year, I was not able to find the subjects interesting. Given that, working hard and scoring well, relative to others, so that at the end of four years, you can pass onto the next phase with a good score was difficult. This model seemed similar to the Olympic qualifiers to me ‚Äì and CPI was certainly not my sport.",
      "But when a senior, once in an attempt to defend CE, somehow motivated me to explore CE thoroughly once before forming an opinion, I looked into the sub-branches of CE, and Geoinformatics excited me. I went in-depth, read a typical ‚ÄòIntroduction to Geoinformatics‚Äô book and I felt that the school mathematics I was missing in college all along ‚Äì was found in Geoinformatics. This led me to dive deeper.",
      "I didn‚Äôt have the courage to approach any professor until mid of my second semester ‚Äì that‚Äôs when I approached Prof Goel in Geoinformatics. I had emailed him one morning and by the evening, thanks to my previous exploration of Geoinformatics, I got an opportunity to work on a project with him in the summers. Then one thing led to another and this pursuit and 3 UGPs and 111 Geoinformatics credits later, Geoinformatics became a deep tech interest of mine. I think of working in Geoinformatics, sometime in my future. There were other perks too.",
      "Firstly, I had a semester drop in my third semester due to medical reasons. I cannot imagine completing my degree within a total of seven academic semesters (and summer semesters) ‚Äì with 60+ credits each semester, had it not been for my interest in Geoinformatics. All my OEs and almost all DEs were in Geoinformatics ‚Äì I had put myself away from the uncertainty of getting a non-scoring /difficult course in the Pingala Rejection Cycle.",
      "Secondly, with degree completion in time at stake, I didn‚Äôt have much motivation to maintain a CPI. But the easy A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs in Geoinformatics certainly covered the D‚Äôs in Structure courses which required time, consistency and practice.",
      "Lastly, proper introduction and interest in pursuing Software Development would not have been possible, but for the partly core ‚Äì partly development internship I did in my third year summers.",
      "Hence the takeaway here is- RECONSIDER. Seriously reconsider your branch. Every branch, I am sure has some portion or the other which can interest you ‚Äì and though many of you run after the MBA, the HSS, the DS/ML/AI courses to complete your credits ‚Äì all of which is freely available with much better teachers (no offense) online, the knowledge you‚Äôre leaving ‚Äì there won‚Äôt be another opportunity to gather again. No course on Coursera/edX/MIT OCW or any other platform ever has matched the practical depth into Geoinformatics I‚Äôve got from the professors at IITK. Hence, reconsider!",
      "Most of my things in college or in career started with design. My first serious design internship was at the startup of Prof. Ghatak, GitiTech. They were developing reusable paper and needed someone to design different kinds of innovative applications of the reusable paper. I worked with them for a few hours a week, and gradually became such a part of their team that during a fest I remained on their stall showcasing and selling their paper the whole time. And even though I felt awkward standing at a stall, but the sales experience I had in calling college groups to our stall and convincing them to buy the paper was unforgettable. I couldn‚Äôt find any of it in the sales lectures I watched some months later. This was when I realised that working with startups is actually the best place to learn and since then, at almost all places I‚Äôve interned at, they have been an early-stage startup.",
      "In May 2019, I joined the Startup Incubation and Innovation Center, IITK as an intern, which I feel was a blessing in disguise as I was intrigued by the professionalism in the body, unlike the student bodies or startups. In my two years working with my manager on and off exploring different roles, the takeaway was how to create a systemized process of workflow between a team so that everything happens easily and flawlessly.",
      "I took a couple of PoRs on campus at various bodies (CS, Vox, EC, HEC, SPO), been a part of a couple of committees, attended many senate meetings, and all of them had their bits of learning experiences.",
      "I started working with Soil Logics, a startup by a couple of Stanford Alumni in my third year as a summer intern and while working on their web application, even though it was a crucial time for me (as I was shifting into a new town in the middle of the pandemic), I enjoyed working on it. Gradually, I realised that developing an application is something that interests me ‚Äì maybe my new abhiruchi. I worked on a couple of more applications (notable mention ‚Äì India COVID Support). In May, when I finally decided to drop my MTech in Geoinformatics and look for a job, this experience was what helped me land a couple of decent offers to choose from.",
      "In conclusion, I really have no advice to give which can fit all, hence I‚Äôll leave you with the idea that it‚Äôs your canvas ‚Äì design your own map!",

      "Pence Mataria is a graduating Y17 student from the Department of Aerospace Engineering. He explains how he made tough decisions and handled various ups and downs during his stay at IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Life‚Äôs interesting; you must live every moment of it to the fullest. I‚Äôll narrate my Life at IITK from a drone‚Äôs eye view of time. Let me equip you with a bit of my background to understand my story better. Since my childhood, I was interested and a bit passionate about science. I got inspired by one of my neighbours and learnt that there exist dedicated institutes for technology. That was the time I set my goal and decided to get in there. One thing to highlight here is that I had a long-term plan and a short-term goal at every walk of my life. Growing up in a state like Gujarat amidst a family engaged in Business polarises you towards the same. That‚Äôs what my long-term goal became ‚Äì to grow and nurture an epic business empire. Path and purpose are independent in some way. The path was unclear to me, but the goal was quite explicit. It was the glamour of being into IIT and passion for tech that brought me here.",
      "Aerospace was something that intrigued me, but I wasn‚Äôt a diehard fan of it. It was the most exciting department I could get based on my rank.¬† Among all the other Aerospace‚Äôs, Kanpur was the only one I envisioned mainly because of the Airstrip. Though, it had been a cliffhanger entry for me into IITK. But then things went smoothly, and I am glad that I successfully graduated from here. I am pretty sure not many people know this, but hello! You are hearing gyan from a ‚ÄúDhakan‚Äù (lingo for the last candidate in the general rank list) of Y17-Aerospace.",
      "After coming to campus, we were introduced to all the gymkhana stuff, festivals, dept labs, and most importantly, unique beings. Like an over admired fresher, I thought of trying everything to find a path to help me connect my long-term goals. I kept attending all the SnT workshops due to my interest in technology. I joined Dramatics Club to bring justice to my little childhood interest in acting. I joined the marketing team of the festival due to my drive to learn Business.¬† I was a national level qualified Air Rifle Shooter. When I discovered that we have a shooting club on the campus, it awoke the dead shooter inside me. So, I joined this club. Coming to acads, I was overwhelmed by other things, and thus I might have diverted the academic share of energy to non-acads. However hard I tried, the L20 back seats were just too cosy for a refreshing sleep. But surprisingly, with collaborative efforts, I managed these to a decent mark along with all the other engagements.",
      "Then I came across the opportunity of contesting in senator‚Äôs elections. My main motive was to understand all the aspects of campus and take myself a bit higher on the leadership game. Contesting elections was a great experience. Thus my tenure in the Senate added to the memories I would cherish in future.",
      "I used to enjoy the working and learning process, which made me push myself to work without any sort of aloofness. This quality-made me sort of excel at what I did. So, Acads check, hobby as drams check, learning Business & Management aspects via marketing check ( I was learning things genuinely; not just fest feels), leadership check, technology & robotics check. Then came the SnT team‚Äôs recruitment. My eyes got laid on this new team which was a combination of my field (Aerospace) and my passion for robotics ‚Äì¬† Aerial Robotics. I buckled up to sincerely devote my time and attention to it. There were around 30 students under a Y15 senior. I managed to excel in this too. I performed well in multiple roles in dramatics, grasped things well in Aerial Robotics, made positive & engaging connections in the Senate and broke some marketing deals in Udghosh.",
      "So, things were progressing, and time started squeezing. It was time to have serious engagements to balance time and learning. I realised that I had to drop something out; I chose dramatics. Gathering the courage to convince the dramatics club senior was the most challenging part. But this is how we learn things. I learnt the art of saying no in the best way.¬† Today, I still share a positive relationship with all of them. A year passed, and I became a senior member at my roles in the AR team and Udghosh, and became the coordinator at the shooting club.",
      "As time was passing, significant responsibilities were waiting for me. The Festival Core team and Ex-core team had high hopes for me. On the other hand, only three people, including me, were left in the aerial robotics team. Shooting club became a low priority for me despite some big goals like developing a shooting range on our campus. It was the time when I started introspecting about what exactly I wanted to do. After analysing my work and future in fest‚Äôs team and AR‚Äôs team, I concluded that the AR team needs me. There were high chances if I would have left, the team might have dissolved since there was no one with that motivation to grow the team, whereas there are many people to keep the fest going. I started looking at my team from an entrepreneurial lens. It was very analogous to a tech start-up. I had the opportunity to grow it and, in the process, learn all the critical management things that will help me in the true sense. But now, the mammoth task was to convincethe Type A personalities of the festival for my resignation. I took the courage, went to Hall1,and told them my way of thinking. Of course, they tried to persuade me, but I stayed firm and handed it delicately. Today, they are very close seniors with whom I chat pretty often.",
      "Days passed, and summers arrived. We were aiming for an international competition. But along with that, I wanted to do a¬† sanity check whether I was fit for research or not and hence, I planned to get into SURGE. While I was pursuing this project, something remarkable happened. There was a government seed scheme from which we can get some funds to develop stuff with start-up potential. Prof had already registered for that. But the catch was, we had to present and pitch and compete at various stages to get that. And yes, I was the one who took it up.¬† I went to Bombay for a pitching event. I worked a lot on my decks. Within a brief span, I grasped all the fundraising gyans. And I made my first formal pitch! (I did that before at techkriti competitions, but that was very na√Øve) And yeah, we made it. It was a massive achievement for me. It was a small sum of INR 10 lacs, but I did it almost single-handedly. In all this, along with managing Aerial Robotics, my summertime got over. So, something which I¬† intended as technical research during my summers ended up being a fundraising self-learned internship. We had some mandatory presentations at the end of SURGE, but I managed that within a few days based on some minor work that we had done. The prof. expected us to continue the project since our money was stuck in there, but I felt a bit reluctant. But we didn‚Äôt close the project. Instead, I focused entirely on the competition during those few months. The competition was approaching, and despite putting in lots of hard work, we were not able to reach a place where we could call ourselves prepared. Things were working but unreliably. We spent most of our last week at Heli lab ‚Äì slept and worked there. Finally, the day came when we boarded for Madrid (my first international trip). The trip was limited to competition as nobody was in a mood to enjoy Spain post-competition. The weather conditions were quite harsh as per our systems there. One of the systems crashed during the final run. We didn‚Äôt make it to the podium, but we learned a lot from other people. Most importantly, we made numerous international connections. After the run, everyone seemed relieved and focused on interviewing other teams about their methods. We concluded that we overcomplicated the stuff. The key was to keep it simple. And on further thoughts, not just technically, but this became another Gyan point of my life. ‚ÄúSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication‚Äù is valid at every walk of life. Also, this gave me a solid opportunity where despite the stressful situations (the baggage of name & fame), I learned to exhibit and impart motivation and calm.",
      "After coming back, I suffered from something called burnout. I was almost on the verge of dropping the UAV field altogether but somehow didn‚Äôt. It took me a month or so to recover. Around November, Inter IIT made us pull our strings. We engaged ourselves for the next twenty days or so. And we were in the raging fire to success no matter what. We applied all our Madrid learnings,¬† and unlike before,¬† I was kind of satisfied with our preparations. We went there and made a blazing victory. We were the only team to complete the problem statement with record-breaking results. This moment gave a massive dose of a boost to everyone in the team and the contingent. We made new connections with DRDO and became the most eyed team in the nation. The key takeaways are never quit from what you feel doing. Follow your instincts. Your instincts will be good when you are good.",
      "The internship prep period was somewhere between this. I finally decided that I am not made for closed-door research stuff and wanted to break into the commercial world as soon as possible. I didn‚Äôt sit for the internship drive. I started applying off-campus at e-taxi companies and drone industry giants overseas for hardware or managerial roles but received late or negative replies. Meanwhile, Airbus came with interesting profiles. I thought to give it a chance. The plan was to get into the aviation field and move to managerial roles at a later stage. With some close contacts and requests, I got a late entry to the portal. I was pretty sure about my selection for the same, despite zero preparations, because I believed myself to be an ideal candidate for the role. And Bingo got offered in the first interview itself!",
      "Then we had general elections. I got the opportunity to lead the same as Associate head SnT council. The decision criteria were: this position would give me another moment to hone my managerial skills and a chance to make some impact. I had always envisioned the teams at par with the most admired global teams from prominent universities. And this was the moment to push it and bring it to life.",
      "Lockdown gave a whole different set of experiences and learnings at home. My Intern was going to get started in midsummers. But since the project required physical presence, it got cancelled. I wasn‚Äôt worried but instead started focusing on developing more business-related insights by attending online MBA courses and helping graduated seniors in the same to get a natural feel of the industry. The council activities got hampered a lot.¬† Funding for teams was no longer a priority for the Institute, which we did acknowledge since it was a difficult time indeed.",
      "The next significant phase were placements. I never prepared for competitive programming or software because I didn‚Äôt want to do any of that in the long term. Instead, I found an ideal role that suited me in every perspective‚Äîproduct management. I selectively applied only where I felt myself to be capable of and confident. My application list was far smaller than others, but I knew I‚Äôd make it. I bagged a product role at an MnC company. The story after that has more thrills and will keep on going forever. That‚Äôs life! Interesting and lively. In totality, just buckle up and enjoy the ride.",

      "Finally, the day came when I sat down to write my ‚ÄòAs We Leave‚Äô article. Since my first year, I used to read these articles, and wonder how would one of mine will look like, and will anyone ever be interested in reading it. I started writing it, and literally wrote 8 pages about my campus life, and still found that a lot was missing. How am I supposed to summarize these four years in a few paragraphs? So, I decided that I won‚Äôt even try to do that, instead, I would try to open up about the struggles that I faced during my stay at IITK. I will try to make it as interesting as I can but bear with me if it gets boring in between because opening about all these struggles is very challenging especially for a person like me who as people around me say and I quote is quite unexpressive in real life, but I will try to be as honest as I can be. In a nutshell, my life here at IITK was a perfect one (at least I like to believe that). Looking back, I don‚Äôt think I have any regrets (I don‚Äôt think anybody does, as this is the most common line, you can find in any AWL article, lol).",
      "So, starting from the beginning, I was an introvert and a shy person (I know, sounds too clich√©, but okay). I used to find it quite difficult to be the conversation starter, but I always wanted to change that about myself. The best support system I always had in my life was my brother, and on the day I reached campus, he advised me to explore the place as much as I can. He said that you have already studied a lot, and it was time to enjoy a few years of your life now. That was probably the best advice, and since day1 I have been doing exactly that. During my first and second years at the campus, I was busy doing a lot of things. I never liked the idea of sitting in the room, and watching shows all day, as I wanted to explore everything that I can. From doing dramatics to volunteering in all the fests to learning photography and film making, to even dancing in DE (yeah I did), to playing basketball, I did it all in my first year (flex, hehe). I somehow also managed to maintain an average CPI all this while. I always had in mind that all I need to do is maintain a decent CPI, and when the time will come I will get serious about my academics as well. But, I got so busy getting involved in these activities that I didn‚Äôt realize when that time came. Till the end of my 3rd semester, I literally had no idea that internship season starts in the 5th semester (trust me), and that other people were busy building their resume profiles from the very first year. I was just having fun. I, vividly remember that it was during a random conversation during the inter-IIT cultural meet when Chandra told me that the companies will start coming in just after the summers. I was really pissed off at myself for not having this basic knowledge, but I had in mind that I still have one complete semester, and the whole summer term in my hand to prepare for the intern season. So, I was OK with it. Then comes the month of January, and which obviously means it‚Äôs ‚ÄúGALAXY‚Äù time. I was clear in my mind that I will participate in it, but this time I also need to focus on my academics, hence I won‚Äôt take too much of a workload on myself. But, somehow things took shape, and I ended up becoming the pool captain (I still have Maitreyee to thank for that). At first, I was pretty reluctant myself of not taking such a big responsibility, but that ‚ÄúHALL FEEL‚Äù, I just could not let it go. I asked her to put me as the last option for this. She convinced me that she will take most of my workload, but still, need someone for the position, and I said yes. But as time progressed, I saw the condition in our pool. I want to be pretty honest here. There were secretaries from various clubs available in our hall as well, but most of them were not really interested in even participating in their club events. They were more focused on attending classes and giving assignments. That feeling was really discouraging. The number of participants in our pool was already restricted, and on top of that, the ones who were holding positions were not really ready to put in the required efforts. As a result, the workload got shifted on the shoulders of a few people, and those few people were working day and night to only participate in the events, let alone win them. Seeing all this, it became impossible for me to focus on my academics, and decided, whatever happens, if I have agreed to be in the position, I need to give my 100% towards it. Those 1.5-2 months were really exhausting for all of the few people involved in participating in the events. I still remember sitting alone in OAT on the final night of Galaxy, completely disappointed, while other pools were pretty happy and excited. My club coordinators Parth (yeah I have a happy memory of him, lol) and Nikhil seeing sitting me alone came to me and started appreciating my efforts. I could not control myself and literally started crying in front of them (probably the first and last time that I cried in front of someone). I was disappointed that putting so much effort was just a waste, and I could have studied just like the others in my hall were doing. They were pretty supportive of me, and were trying to calm me down, when I heard the name ‚ÄúShauryas‚Äù on the stage, yes we won the FAC trophy (I still am getting goosebumps). I was so disappointed, I never bothered to check the final points tally. After that, we won 2 more trophies, and that was the first time that our pool had won any, let alone 3 overall club trophies (yahan to flex banta hai, hehe). That feeling is something I can never put into words. I was super proud of myself and my pool members, but the saddest part about it all was there was no one from our pool left in OAT to celebrate with. Either they were too busy doing assignments, or were too disappointed (like me) to stay there. But, that was one of my best days at IITK.",
      "There was this one thing that was quite prevalent on campus, that girls get everything too easy, and that they don‚Äôt have to hustle for it as much as boys have to do. While watching people doing the things they were doing in Galaxy, I literally felt why do people say that. But, throughout my campus life, I have tried to prove this statement wrong. I was not the most creative or the most talented one, but I am proud to say that at least I tried.",
      "Anyway, moving on (otherwise I will again write 2 more pages on this) when the hangover for all this was down, I realized how much I fucked up my academics doing all this. That was the only semester, I got 2 Ds in my courses, thanks to my friends, otherwise I definitely would have failed. I had no idea what I was going to do in my summers, and next up in the intern season, as that semester was near to its end. And somehow, I could not do anything productive in the summer term as well, and as a result, I completely messed up my internship season. That 6th semester was one of the most depressing ones, as far as academics were concerned, as I was literally just sitting there and watching my friends getting great internships one by one. Deep down I knew that I was not really prepared, and this thought was eating me up. I remember being involved in Antaragni, which was the only good time I had in my day and was quite depressed the other times. The month of November was really depressing, as Antaragni got over, and most of the day I was just sitting in my room. Somehow, I was not able to forgive myself for being so careless towards my career. During these times, you realize the true meaning of the friends that you make, and I am proud to say that I had the best ones to always support and guide me. So, finally, I decided to let it be and started preparing for the placements, at the same time looking for off-campus interns as well. I don‚Äôt know, but somehow I would say that I got lucky that I was able to secure a good internship. But, I think by all this, I got too scared for the placements.",
      "Next was the time for filling the Antaragni core-team nominations. For me, the dream of being in the core team started from the final night of Antaragni in the first year. This was something I was always sure about, I was even sure about which cell I wanted to be in since my first year (yes I was). But, as the nominations came by, this thought of losing my career out of my hands started pouring in. I was scared that if I will get into the core team, I will again mess up my academics, and this time the stakes were higher. It was the placements. I talked to a lot of seniors, but their opinions were mixed, and I did not get a clear picture. So, I turned to my brother for advice. He told me that you have done enough exploration in your 3 years at the campus, and now it‚Äôs time to focus on your career. I felt him and thought his advice was correct, as he was the one who in the first place encouraged me to do all these extra-curriculars. So, I was finally making a decision to quit filling Antaragni nomination, but there was this discomfort in my heart. I was still not satisfied with my decision. I thought that looking back at college life, reminding myself not doing that one thing that I always dreamed of will kill me. The feel of those ‚Äúfour days‚Äù, and all the struggle and hard work that goes behind that. The fire that rose in my heart in the very first year, and that still is rising high, how can I let that go so easily. For me, Antaragni was never a festival, it was an emotion, how was I supposed to kill that emotion so easily. I could not have lived with that regret for my entire life. Hence, for the first time, I went against my brother‚Äôs advice and filled up the nominations. I convinced myself that even if I don‚Äôt get into a very good company now, with some efforts, I can always switch to a better one in my future. How difficult can that be? But this emotion and this feel are going to stay with me forever. Though the on-ground Antaragni never happened, that team has introduced me to some of the greatest people on campus, and I will always be grateful for that.",
      "Looking back today, all these worries seem to be too minuscule compared to the experience I have gained during my four years at college. One important thing that I have learned in my journey here at IITK is that whatever good or bad is happening in your life, there is a purpose behind each and every part of it. Good things give you memories while bad things give you experience. For instance, I got a 0 on my first PHY quiz (I think most can relate to it) and was bonded with two of the closest people I had on campus while doing those rants. Or the instance, when not getting an internship helped me focus on my placements so much more. Each and every experience helps you become a better person. Another thing that I learned was the importance of having good friends. There are people that you just know, and then there are people with whom you feel deeply connected, and I am proud to say that I have found some of the best people on campus. These are the people I know will stay with me till the very end, and that I can always turn to them for any r*nd* r*n* (am I allowed to write that?) whatsoever.",
      "Lastly, my advice to juniors is simple. This campus can give you a vast amount of opportunities to learn and explore, all you need to do is step out of your rooms (after coming back to campus obviously). While doing all this, don‚Äôt ignore your academics (like I did), but at the same time don‚Äôt stress too much over them. Placements will happen eventually. Also, it is very important to make good friends while you are in college. I don‚Äôt think you can ever find such a great peer group in your life. People are always there to help you, but you also need to be available for others in order to grow together. And you can always shape your personality in whichever form you like to. With this, I would conclude this, I have not tried to summarize my life here, because I don‚Äôt think anyone will be interested in that. Instead, I tried that even if there is a single person out there who can relate to my struggles, might get some confidence with this article. Adios!",

      "Aman Gautam is a Y17 graduating student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He talks about the challenges he faced and his journey through the 4 years of his undergraduate degree.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I belong to a small village but was brought up in an environment that always taught me to dream big.",
      "The first time I heard about IITs, was when I was in class 12. Post which, I undertook a year of JEE preparation, and got enrolled in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IITK (though I was getting EE at IITK, I was inspired by the movie 3 Idiots üôÇ and was interested in machines, so I took ME). I had spent a year in Kanpur city during my JEE prep, but I hadn‚Äôt gotten a chance to visit IIT Kanpur even once : (. So, when I first came to IITK, I was very excited. My parents were often told, ‚Äútumhare bete ko ek acchi job milegi, college se nikalkar‚Äù (which did become true later :)). But since I belonged to a lower-middle-class family, getting a job was a great moment of happiness for me and my family members.",
      "However, during the time of document verification, an event took place that really changed my personality. Someone (I guess he was a part of the administrative staff) said to me, ‚ÄúSir, yahan survive karna mushkil hoga aapko, so ready rehna for struggle‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why he said that to me. Maybe because I belonged to a reserved category? But at that time, I ignored him. However, whenever I performed poorly in my academics, I would think that maybe he was right. I would then feel inferior to others and would underestimate myself. Luckily, I had a chill roommate in my first year. Whenever I talked to him, half of my stress would disappear!",
      "Besides, personally speaking, whenever you feel inferior to someone due to academics, talk to a friend who is nearly the same, or less intelligent than you are. You will surely be relieved to some extent!",
      "I enjoyed the orientation program and loved the ‚ÄúBap/Bhai‚Äù culture. Life was super chill till the orientation program, post which, the real struggle began. The first week of academics passed by and pretty much nothing had gone into my head. I was a bit stressed and the one reason behind this was the language barrier (as I had studied in a Hindi medium school, I had never been instructed in English properly).",
      "The Counselling Service helped me a lot by conducting lectures in Hindi. I also started following other people‚Äôs suggestions ‚Äî reading English newspapers, watching Hollywood movies/English web series (which I didn‚Äôt initially enjoy). But watching such content, with subtitles, really helped me understand my professors‚Äô lectures better. The problem reduced gradually but persisted till my 2nd year. I ended up completing my first year with an average CPI, without failing any courses; this really boosted my self-confidence üôÇ",
      "A sweet memory of my birthday party with my bhais (most of them are cool) and Bapu (pseudo; actually hamara baap koi aur hi tha but care koi aur karta tha,that‚Äôs why üòõ :‚Äô) )",
      "I hadn‚Äôt explored much in my first year because I had a fear of letting my CPI fall below the threshold of any scholarship (which never happened :‚Äô), my bad)",
      "I had really liked aeroplanes since my childhood so I couldn‚Äôt stop myself when the Aeromodelling Club was introduced to me. Here, I learned about collaborative and team-building skills from my seniors (in the black t-shirt) and other team members, and made exciting memories and connections with some amazing people!",
      "In my second year, I explored other fields and joined the Summer of Code 2018 (SOC), IITK (no selection criteria at the time). This was a learning curve for me. I would definitely recommend this to first-year students too. If Web/App development interests you, you will get a broad perspective out of this. Here‚Äôs one of my sweetest memories, captured in a photograph:",
      "Up until then, I had explored most things, except ‚Äòthe mechy ones‚Äô, so I joined the Robocon Team in my third semester. Here, I met an amazing group of people (don‚Äôt have a team picture though :‚Äô)) who were all extremely passionate about making bots. I still can‚Äôt forget the handful of night-outs that were carried out before a submission deadline!",
      "I must reiterate one thing ‚Äî if you are enthusiastic and have the curiosity to learn, no one will ever refuse you. So,without any hesitation,join whichever club/team excites you! Not only will it give you exposure to working in a team (which matters a lot), but would help you build connections with seniors.",
      "In fact, only later did I realize this, but working in the Robocon team became one of the main reasons that helped me get placed. Now, you may wonder how the core work of the Robocon team helped me bag a software profile? Well, maybe it was just about the teamwork skills.",
      "I had gotten a taste of both core and non-core tasks, but I was still unable to choose a profile to prepare for, so I ended up applying for both the profiles in the internship season. Guess what? I didn‚Äôt get any internships because I performed averagely in both core and non-core profiles‚Äô tests. As getting an internship is relatively tougher and more competitive than placements, it requires you to be good at at least some skill. Thus, I felt like a failure after not getting an internship. However, though I was worried and felt insecure about my future, I realized it was time I decided which profile I was good at and should aim for.",
      "I would think and question myself a lot. I had always gotten below-average marks in my departmental courses, how could I perform well in a core profile? I‚Äôve now understood that such a mindset was merely a consequence of not getting an internship in a core profile. At the time, my coding skills were limited to‚Äòmujhe coding me loop hi likhna aata hai bas‚Äô. But finally, I made the decision to apply only for coding profiles, regardless of the difficulties.",
      "To others, I would suggest ‚Äî take a firm decision about your career as soon as possible because then only will you get sufficient time and have more focus for preparing for placements.",
      "After the 6th semester (March‚Äô20, when the lockdown started ), ek senior ki entry huyi in my life (though I never met him in person :‚Äô( ), who really helped me make the decision of pursuing coding, even though it was a very challenging task for me. So, if you want to see what ‚Äòstruggle‚Äô looks like, here‚Äôs my attempt at describing it:",
      "Many times will come‚Ä¶",
      "‚Ä¶when you‚Äôll hate the journey you have chosen.",
      "‚Ä¶when you will be close to giving up.",
      "‚Ä¶when you will be wanting to quit.",
      "It is in those moments that you‚Äôd need a person who has already been through the same struggle. It is those people who are going to remind you why your current struggle is worth it.",
      "He was that person for me. Whenever I felt frustrated, he‚Äôd always motivate and encourage me. Many a time, I found the journey very challenging, but I continued my hard work with the same energy for 4 months and ended up getting placed in a decent startup. I still can‚Äôt forget the day before the interview. I was really nervous and that‚Äôs when I was told something truly motivating by my senior, ‚ÄúBhai, ye samajh, kal tera hi din hai, tujhe to company le hi jayegi!‚Äú. I ended up getting not one, but two offers the next day :‚Äô). It was the happiest day of my life. After that, I felt very relaxed and all my worries disappeared.",
      "‚ÄúEnjoy and explore as much as possible in your first year. Continue with at least one of your favourite clubs/teams/extracurriculars in the second year. Then push yourself hard to get yourself an internship or placed in your third/fourth year‚Äù (may be wrong for some BAKAIT people though :)).",
      "After you‚Äôve given your 100%, it‚Äôs fine even if you get below-average marks in most of your courses, or feel inferior to your competitive colleagues sometimes, or even if you don‚Äôt get an internship! For there can be many internal thoughts which may bother you, but stay confident and improve yourself, bit by bit.",
      "Overall, these four years were amazing and filled with unforgettable moments. Thanks to IITK for transforming me completely and connecting me to some really amazing folks.",

      "Nostalgia, thou truly are a duplicitous bitch!",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful force but a deceptive one. In the maelstrom of the moment, we often tend to reminisce about the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù, in the process of which we shroud our sufferings and lock them in our past. If I‚Äôd have written this piece the previous year, I would indeed be brimming with hope and would definitely be talking about the so-called ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù of college. But having been back on the campus, albeit for merely two months, that rosy picture of the past has been unseated to give way to a more realistic understanding of my time at IITK.",
      "I don‚Äôt think that the readership of this column would be a least bit interested in learning about the cliched details of my campus life (i.e., projects, PORs, interns, and placement) than they would be interested in knowing who Klemens von Metternich was. (That story is bland and uninteresting). So, if I have to impress upon the readers a sincere narration of my time at IITK, I must start from the beginning.",
      "Before I start yapping about myself, I‚Äôd like you to construct a mental picture. A picture of a distorted, irregular form (say, the ill-formed clay used in pottery). This represents our personality when we are born. Growing up, it rests on our parents to nurture and construct our characters to the best of their understanding. This is where the issue arises. In most middle-class families, the parents look outwards towards society to model their child‚Äôs dreams and aspirations. They sculpt our personalities keeping in mind what society thinks is worthy, leading to a very parochial understanding of success and failure in the child‚Äôs mind. For him getting a good score is good, and wasting time on video games is bad. During this period of our lives, the scope of our free will seems to be very limited since, until this age, we undergo an aggressive socialisation process. During this period, we can be nothing but what society turns us into. I, too, grew up with this provincial understanding of life.",
      "Individual identity is a very crucial thing. It tethers us to a very realistic understanding of our self-worth, and it defines who we are. In those initial years, I only had my academics with me on the identity front. My sole authority for self-worth and self-confidence was that I was good at academics in school. It is in my first semester when this bubble burst, when I was robbed of this pride leaving a very soul-crushing void in my identity. I realised that, despite my mother‚Äôs confidence, I was not good at academics. There were individuals who were far better than me, not only in academics but in every other aspect. If life was indeed a rat race, I wasn‚Äôt even on the ground, and these guys were already at the finish line. I was confronted with a difficult truth. The truth that I am worth nothing. I wasn‚Äôt skilled in academics, I couldn‚Äôt play a musical instrument, I don‚Äôt have any hobbies, I haven‚Äôt read novels, I wasn‚Äôt good in sports, and many more such flaws were suddenly staring me down the barrel. I suffered from an identity crisis.",
      "Making matters worse was crippling anxiety that I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. I am not sure whether many people experience this, but being granted admission on an affirmative action program planted a seed of self-doubt in my psyche. A seed that resulted in me questioning my worth. While growing up, the society indoctrinated me to believe in a lie that people availing the affirmative action program are lazy freeloaders who don‚Äôt carry merit and are afraid of competition. I was so conditioned to believe this lie that I felt guilty of my existence. My mental state was so self-deprecating that I once remarked to a friend, ‚ÄúYaar General rank se aana chahiye tha, aise aana cheating lag raha hai‚Äù. It took me some time to unlearn this lie of merit, a lie which I carried with me for most of my life. This lie led me to question my existence, my worth and even my presence on the campus. It took some effort and reading to come to an understanding that ‚ÄúAffirmative Action is not a poverty alleviation program‚Äù ‚ÄúIn principle, affirmative action is an instrument for identifying merit in individuals in historically marginalised communities‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd more importantly, affirmative action is about social justice‚Äù1. My anxiety from imposter syndrome left me only when I questioned my belief system and opened my mind to a broader understanding of things. Now, having been on this roller coaster ride of self-discovery, I can indeed assert myself with confidence and can say without getting all revengy that ‚ÄúI got what I deserved!‚Äù.",
      "Earlier, I mentioned that our personalities and understanding of the world is mirrored by our parents to the wants and needs of society. While this has the downside of robbing us of our free agency to act on the plethora of choices offered by life. But there‚Äôs an upside too. Not exactly a positive aspect, but an aspect worth discovering. After being closeted with a unipolar view, the college life, especially at IITK, offers us an opportunity to appreciate, understand and celebrate the sheer complexity of this multipolar world. It pushes us to embrace new ideas, new ideals, and a new trajectory for our lives. It empowers us to cast, shape and model our personality to the best of our understanding. For the first time in our lives, we are now in the driving seat. The choices are ours, and so is the responsibility. We are now the flagbearers of our personality. We can now pick and choose how we wanna shape ourselves. We can re-discover and re-invent ourselves to our likings. Though all this new responsibility is scary at first, but I believe that‚Äôs how we truly grow; that‚Äôs how we evolve towards our better self. And we keep doing this all through our lives.",
      "It took me some time to formulate this understanding, and I tried to reflect this understanding in the choices I made at IITK. While the academic front continued at its ordinary course of mediocrity, I wanted to diversify myself. And sorry, I didn‚Äôt join clubs or projects. I ventured into the unexplored field (by me) of liberal arts. I found my calling in law. And no, I am not quitting engineering to be a lawyer; it‚Äôs just that I enjoy reading about legal discourse. I am enchanted by the legal realism of Oliver Wendell Holmes, by the empowering spirit of RBG, by the courageous defiance of H.R. Khanna, by the landmark judgements of D.Y. Chandrachud and by many more great individuals who have made a difference in this world. (Here, I would apologise to all those who bore the brunt of my boring sermons regarding the law. I‚Äôm genuinely sorry you had to take that.) While the law had its unique place in my college experience, I also discovered, admittedly for the first time in my life, the world of novels. Because of them, I was going places. I explored London with Jeffrey Archer, Kerala with Arundhati Roy, Dublin with James Joyce, NYC with J.D. Salinger, Florence & Rome with Dan Brown, and Hogwarts with¬†J.K. Rowling. I mention this not to brag, but to introduce the readers to these great authors like they were introduced to me by my few well-intentioned seniors. I found in these authors some excellent tour guides; I hope you do too.",
      "Well, this is how I spent my time. With books and my uncharted mind. I also had the opportunity to be acquainted with and built strong bonds with some of the best individuals on campus. They, despite their shortcomings, added meaning to the campus life and made it worth living. If it weren‚Äôt for them, all of us wouldn‚Äôt have survived the existential brouhaha of campus life. Kudos to all of them!",
      "I don‚Äôt know how to end this. I have no lesson for you, as my journey too, has just begun. You can pick and choose if anything‚Äôs relevant to you. Otherwise, you just wasted a few minutes reading some bloke blathering about random stuff. I think ending with Faiz is very appropriate since he‚Äôs kind of our campus icon, and I have just the couplet to capture his existentialist angst.",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I made it into IIT Kanpur by a margin of just 1 rank, narrowly missing the option I had filled just above it. It almost seems like fate that I made it here. I still remember my first few days on campus. The first time I looked into the room I was allotted, it was a huge shock. I had almost never seen such a small room in my life and on top of that, it was supposed to be triple sharing. That feeling passed within a week as I soon realised these were going to be the best 4 years of my life. To be fair, I was technically wrong because the current situation cost us all more than a year of that.",
      "One of the first experiences I can recall on campus was my first shower where I forgot to carry my towel. Not knowing anyone particularly well at that point, I called out to anyone who might be out there to kindly fetch me my towel. As it turns out, the unknown guy who fetched it for me, ended up becoming one of my best friends on campus.",
      "A huge change that came over me on campus was learning to perform efficiently in a messy environment. In my first year, I made my bed every night before going to sleep and bedtime was strictly at 12AM. My wardrobe was neatly arranged with shirts on hangers. Come second year and 12AM is when the most active part of the day started, with canteen visits and bulla sessions etc. My sleep routine consisted of turning lights off and lying down, the former soon becoming optional. I‚Äôll admit, these changes did not go over well during the quarantine at home where such ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù forms of living were not tolerated. For some reason, I could never get my parents to admit that I‚Äôm way more fit and athletic when I‚Äôm just returning from campus. They instead insist that I had somehow become malnourished, despite visiting the canteen twice daily apart from Lunch and Dinner. Oh in case it‚Äôs unclear, breakfast exists only on paper for most of us.",
      "I joined my Math department buddies in complaining about how unjustly difficult our department is, at every opportunity I got. But to be honest I have a lot of respect for it. I‚Äôve come to realise that as difficult as it is, every other branch of engineering owes a lot to the few math department people who actually end up pursuing it further. I originally came to IIT Kanpur in the Aerospace Department and applied for a department change after my first year. According to previous data, I was expecting to get into Mechanical and had spent some time hyping myself up for it. The branch change results came as a mild irritation then, since I had to re-hype myself for Mathematics. But eventually, you realise in the Mathematics department that you get really good at a lot of concepts that are the prerequisite knowledge for every other engineering career. The only thing missing is a focus towards practical applications. However, that‚Äôs where the much higher than average number of OEs come into the picture. So for example I used up all of my OEs in CSE courses. Any courses involving Machine Learning showcase Linear Algebra. One of my favourite courses on campus was Modern Cryptology. That course managed to cultivate a respect for one of the most infamous courses of our department, Abstract Algebra. Of course, no department is without its drawbacks, the primary one of mine being the difficult grading because I guess Mathematicians are supposed to be held to a higher standard :-P.",
      "Now as we prepare to leave, I try to imagine scenarios in my mind where I meet up with each of my campus friends again in the future. In doing so, I come to realise that there are different kinds of friends we have on campus and some of them are connections that won‚Äôt last outside the campus setting unfortunately. You have those friends who are always less prepared than you for any upcoming test. So you get to alleviate your own fears through them, on the night outs before tests. I read this in a meme once but one of the most comforting things for a UG student to hear is ‚ÄúBro, I haven‚Äôt even started yet‚Äù. Then you have those whose hunger clocks are oddly synced up with yours and you keep having unplanned meetups up with them in canteens. The only ones I do see myself definitely staying in touch with over the years are the few people in whose rooms I‚Äôve spent comparable time, just like my own room. I wasn‚Äôt too outgoing at school, having only 2 or 3 good friends. But college gave me a fresh start. There‚Äôs an overabundance of geeks like me who I can easily talk about Marvel, DC, or games. Also, something which is possibly an IIT Kanpur only thing is that everyone here is your ‚Äúbhai‚Äù. I remember we were explicitly told in our first years not to call our seniors ‚Äúbhaiya‚Äù, but the primary form of greeting on campus is ‚Äúaur bhai‚Äù. That‚Äôs a line that works on your closest friends as well as people you‚Äôve only seen once before and find randomly on the street. This particular phrase has even penetrated the quarantine situation where, even on phone calls with friends we greet with ‚Äúaur bhai‚Äù.",
      "A few of the things I will miss include finding at least 5 people from your wing awake at any hour of the day. There are two kinds of night outs, one during exams and one after the endsems. While one may sound vastly superior to the other, it‚Äôs surprising how both kinds will be missed. The pre exam night outs are a phenomenon missed out on by the most consistent workers among us, who are admittedly few and far. However, there‚Äôs something to be said about the departmental bonding over pre-exam fears. Movie nights will never be as good as ordering Kathi rolls for movie intermission at 1AM, while 4 guys huddle up inside a ‚Äúrazai‚Äù. One of my favourite moments on campus was a LAN gaming session where we lined up two of the tables in a row and 6 wingies sat down face to face for some Rainbow Six Seige. To be honest, that was the first time we ever noticed why the Institute shut down LAN connections after 12. And we hated it as it cut our fun down to 3 short hours. Another cherished memory was when we decided at 12AM to catch the 12:45 show for ‚ÄúInto the Spiderverse‚Äù at ZSquare, which involved convincing a wingie that his quiz the next day was just ‚Äúmoh maaya‚Äù so he could join us as well.",
      "An advice I‚Äôd give to my first year self would be to not get too attached to sitting in your room and watching youtube etc. I enjoyed my third year on campus the most, owing mostly to the fact that I played badminton almost everyday till 3AM, and frequent excursions to OAT for Kathi rolls. To be honest the fact that Kathi Rolls refuses to deliver below a minimum order is a blessing in disguise. It forces ordering rolls to be a community affair even if you decide to get it delivered. For the current batch, since you get 1 year less, you unfortunately get even less time than us to adjust to campus life so you better get used to it fast to make the most of your remaining time at least. I do not think it‚Äôs possible to ever have an environment like I had at IIT Kanpur ever again in life.",

      "Nitish Vikas Deshpande is a Y17 graduating student from the Department of Electrical Engineering. He talks about his experience with his curriculum and his research interests with a sweet taste of Electrical Engineering.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "From the title of this blog, you must have deduced that I am graduating from electrical engineering (In electrical engineering, ¬†the imaginary unit is normally denoted byjinstead ofi, becauseiis commonly used to denote electric current). Today, I have completed 2.75 + 1.25jyears at IIT Kanpur.¬† Although the overall magnitude of the phasor reduced from 4 to 3.02, the imaginary part of my stay here created a positive phase shift and aligned me in the right direction. The pandemic has shown us that life is not purely resistive but also has a reactive component which results in a complex impedance. We have to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù this complex impedance that the pandemic has brought in our lives. My journey at IITK and through electrical engineering has been phenomenal. IITK¬† provided me with a huge bandwidth to explore my interests during the 2.75 years and a large reconfigurable antenna array for beamforming my efforts and overcoming the uncontrollable blockages during the 1.25 years of the pandemic.¬† By now, some of you must have figured out the significance of these jargons from electrical engineering.¬† For the past few months, I have been writing a journal paper for submission to Wireless Transactions. I wrote this article in the same duration. I found resemblance between mathematical models in wireless systems to the student life at IITK.¬† I present some of these wireless models in my article and relate it to my IITK journey.",
      "The path of a student from Sem 1 to Sem 8 is like a multipath wireless channel with infinitely many routes from source to destination.¬† In one‚Äôs journey, one will experience many scatterers which may create both constructive or destructive interference.¬† The scatterers in your journey may be your student guide, Counselling Service family, friends‚Äô circle in your wing, clubs/hobby groups, department; seniors, juniors and batchmates; your course instructors, UGP advisor, sometimes even IITK alumni. ¬† I experienced many rich scatterers.¬† One of my first scatterers is my student guide who is also an EE graduate.¬† He helped me in the smooth transition to campus life.¬† I developed a strong rapport with him. We even shared some common EE courses. He was also my lab partner in the EE381 lab (although we couldn‚Äôt complete the project component of the EC lab due to the closure of Spring 20 semester). My next rich scattering environment was provided by the Electronics Club of IITK.¬† I was first introduced to the E-club during my orientation. I remember being fascinated by the ‚ÄúBrain-Computer Interface‚Äù project in Orientation‚Äô 17 presented by a Y16 Eclub secy. He later became a very close friend and also my collaborator in the first industrial project of the SnT council with Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). During my first year, I met some of my best friends at Takneek Electromania, Eclub winter camp, and summer camp. Some of them became my fellow coordinators in my third year. Being a part of the Eclub family and the SnT council opened several opportunities for me.",
      "I participated in three editions of INTER IIT Tech Meet, and international competitions like DJI Robomasters and IEEE Signal Processing Cup challenge. I also had an opportunity to conduct institute-wide lectures that helped me develop public speaking skills.¬† During my tenure as E-club coordinator, I was lucky to interact with the founder of E-club, Mohan Tambe, who had visited IITK and Eclub during the 1980 batch reunion.",
      "He had founded E-club with the vision that the students retain the knowledge that they gain by doing hands-on work. I was also lucky to interact with Dr. Sumit Chowdhury (EE graduate from 1992)¬† during my first techmeet at IITB.¬† He, a technology advisor to BARC,¬† was a member of the evaluation panel who approached our team at the end of our presentation and asked ‚ÄúWhich Hall, guys?‚Äù.¬† The interaction with him during techmeet became a one year long collaboration with BARC. He even met us a year later in Hall 12 canteen where he shared experiences from his undergraduate days.",
      "To summarize, the E-club is where I made some of the best friends at IITK and connected with some influential alumni, who influenced my personality and provided me with a plethora of opportunities to explore my interests.¬† I still have some pending projects/ideas at E-club which had to be discontinued due to the pandemic. I hope that the future generation in E-club will work on those ideas and revive the culture of E-club!",
      "The third rich scattering environment was the Electrical Engineering department of IITK. The EE Department of IITK is one of the most active research hubs in the world. My research journey began with working on a project in music information retrieval (MIR) with Prof. Vipul Arora. Like many others from my batch, I had decided to pursue a research project via the SURGE program for undergraduate research. Although this project did not lead to any significant output in terms of publication, I got an opportunity to grasp the fundamental concepts in signal processing and machine learning. I also became familiar with the methodology of conducting research. I developed a strong rapport with Prof. Arora. He also encouraged me to attend an audio processing workshop at IITB in my 5th semester, where I connected with some of the pioneers in MIR, like Prof. Mueller and Prof. Serra.¬† Interacting with them helped me develop an interest in pursuing a career in academic research.",
      "Around the same time, I had developed an inclination towards wireless communication theory. During the Eclub project on Witrack, I and my team got preliminary exposure to software-defined radios (SDR). We had built a miniature Frequency Modulated Carrier Wave RADAR using the hardware components in Prof. A R Harish‚Äôs Microwave Lab. The DC course on communication theory, EE320, further boosted my interest. I had also attended a talk by Dr. Ing Habil Ulrich L. Rohde, a pioneer in radio frequency and microwave technology, organized at IITK as a part of the Institute Diamond Jubilee Lecture series. In this talk, I met a Y15 EE senior, who had also worked on SDR previously during his internship at UCSD. Connecting with him has been a very important part of my academic journey. He has been a very influential senior who helped me shape my career path. I later had an opportunity to record a podcast with him on ‚Äú5G and Beyond‚Äù.",
      "Till now, my journey would have seemed to you like a smooth ride without any obstacles. However, just like the direct link between receiver and transmitter in a wireless communication system is blocked by obstacles, my path got blocked by the COVID pandemic. Many of my friends had secured good corporate internships during the intern season in the 5th semester. Since I was interested in pursuing graduate studies after B.Tech, I had decided to not apply for corporate internships via SPO. I had started applying for research internships.¬† At the end of November 2019, I had secured an internship at Texas A&M University with a professor who worked in the area of deep reinforcement learning. I had also secured another research internship opportunity at New York University Tandon School of Engineering in the area of wireless communication networks. However, both internships had to be rescinded due to the COVID pandemic. I received notification of the rescindment in late March.¬† I did not have any other backup plan for summers. Some of my batchmates also faced a similar obstacle. I will now describe my journey through the pandemic by first presenting a similar situation in wireless communication and the technology envisioned by the academic community to overcome this problem. I will then propose to apply this wireless model to the IITK student‚Äôs model.",
      "The wireless propagation environment is often uncontrollable because of the presence of random blockages which cause heavy attenuation of the signal from transmitter to the receiver. Recently, the wireless community has proposed a new technology called theintelligent reflecting surface¬† (IRS).",
      "An IRS is made up of several elements called reflecting elements (RE)which can modify the wireless propagation environment by passively creating phase shifts in the incoming signal and beamforming it towards the receiver. ¬† Now, I apply this concept to the IITK model.¬† Consider yourself as the base station (BS) who wants to achieve a particular goal but cannot do so, as the direct path is blocked by the pandemic.¬† I propose to apply the concept of the IRS which can create a phase shift and take you along a different path to reach your destination.¬† The IRS here refers to a collection of individuals (RE) from the IITK community who will passively influence your decisions and take you along a different path to reach your destination. This group of individuals won‚Äôt let your signal strength attenuate because of the obstacle. Every student will require a different set of individuals to influence his path based on the nature of the obstacle. For eg, a student who is in depression would require help from the counselling service.¬† A student who is in need of career guidance would take help from the academics and career council representative.¬† A student who requires financial assistance will reach out to the DOSA representative.¬† The student would need to ask for help and get in touch with many such individuals who will provide an alternate route to reach the destination.¬† Note that it is the base station which controls the phase shifts of each reflecting element of the IRS. So, it is entirely up to the student to reach out to those individuals who would be willing to help him.¬† I would like to quote the famous line by the Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore which is relevant in the IITK context, ‚ÄúHelp will always be given at IITK to those whoaskfor it.‚Äù",
      "Coming back to my story,¬† after the announcement of the rescinding of my research internship in summer 2020, I had started looking out for alternative opportunities.¬† Some of my friends, who were in a similar situation, decided to postpone their graduation plans by converting to a dual degree and stay back another year at IITK working on a Master‚Äôs thesis. After consulting some Y14 and Y15 EE seniors, I decided that I will continue with my pre-pandemic goals of applying for graduate school. I knew that applying for graduate school for Fall 21 semester was going to be super competitive given the pandemic and since many students from Fall 20 had to defer admits to Fall 21. I decided to take up this challenge and utilize the five months vacation (April-August) for building a good research profile. In 6th sem, I had opted for the elective course on stochastic geometry based analysis of wireless networks by Prof. Abhishek Gupta. I decided to continue working on the term project of that course with my batchmate who was the only other UG student in that course. ¬† Fortunately, Prof. Gupta was very cooperative and mentored us to work further on that topic. After multiple discussions via mail, we finally got some good results and decided to submit our work to the IEEE ANTS conference. This paper got accepted in November 2020, and I presented the paper at the virtual ANTS 20 conference. In May 2020, I attended the virtual ICASSP conference. I came across the concept of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) which I had described earlier. I approached Prof. Rohit Budhiraja and expressed my interest in working on a problem related to the IRS.¬† I am fortunate that Prof Budhiraja welcomed me in his group.¬† I continued working on the problem for the 7th and 8th sem for my UGP and am currently writing a journal paper. At the end of September 2020, I had to make a decision whether to apply for MS or Ph.D. Fortunately, Prof. Abhishek Gupta had posted about a Ph.D. opening in Prof. Robert Heath‚Äôs group. I was excited by this news and decided to put in more effort to make a good Ph.D. application.¬† I am thankful for the guidance and support provided by my mentors in my research work. A few weeks after the application, I received an email from Prof. Heath stating that he found my application phenomenal and would be happy to have me work under his supervision. I feel very grateful to have received an email from Prof. Heath, who is a pioneer in the field of MIMO communications. The key takeaway from my story is to not let the obstacles stop you from pursuing your dreams. Instead, one should take help from the IITK community which will provide an alternate route to realize your dreams.¬† In my journey, my batchmates, seniors, and professors from EE were the key reflecting elements which beamformed me towards my goal.",
      "Pilot training is a key stage in any wireless communication system.¬† A pilot sequence is a known sequence and the BS estimates the channel by using the received pilot symbols transmitted by the user. After learning the channel environment, the BS then designs its beamforming vector.",
      "In the IITK student‚Äôs model, the pilot sequence transmitted by the user can refer to the experiences shared by the seniors. Learning from the experiences of others can save us a lot of time so that we can avoid committing the same mistakes. Based on these experiences, the student can then decide to beamform his efforts in the right direction and avoid paths with heavy attenuation.For the past year, we all have been away from the busy life of campus due to the pandemic. Here, I would like to inform you that this is not the first time that students have been forced to stay away from university life due to unforeseen circumstances.¬† A few centuries ago, Isaac Newton was in his early 20s when the Great Plague of London hit. Cambridge sent students home to continue their studies. Freed from the restrictions of the limited curriculum and rigours of university life, Newton had the time and space to develop his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of motion and gravity.",
      "We all should take inspiration from Newton who also worked from home (WFH). He would say about this forced time away from university life: ‚ÄòFor in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention & minded Mathematics & Philosophy more than at any time since.‚Äô‚Äù¬† My definition of WFH is a bit different. I call it the XFY.¬† Here, X is not just restricted to work.¬† For me, X stands for exploration.¬† The Zoom era has enabled us to explore the world.¬† My favourite part is that I have been able to attend numerous virtual conferences and interact with researchers all over the world via zoom.¬† Many professors have also provided access to lecture recordings.¬† We should utilize this opportunity to gain knowledge in highly specialized areas. Here, Y is not limited to the study table at your home.¬† It can be almost any place with internet connectivity. Last week, I witnessed an extreme example of Y during the virtual ICC 2021 conference from Prof. Rappaport who participated in the fireside chat with Prof. Heath while driving down the interstate highway.",
      "IITK provided me with the gift of knowledge and intellect in a very specialized area within a short span of time.¬† It also provided me with an excellent set of friends to share this gift.¬† The EE curriculum at IITK taught me about the major discoveries and inventions ranging from theFourier Transformin 1822,Maxwell‚Äôsequation in 1865,Claude Shannon‚Äôsseminal work on ‚ÄúMathematical Theory of Communication‚Äù in 1948, and last but not the least aboutThomas Marzetta‚Äôsseminal work on Massive MIMO in 2010. Today, I¬† am about to start a new chapter in my life by standing on the shoulders of these four giants in EE to pursue research at the intersection of signal processing, electromagnetic theory, information theory, and wireless communications. Today, as an electrical engineer, I find myself in a unique position to create a positive impact in the world.",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "It was 21stMay 2017, after struggling for straight six hours, I somehow managed to write the two sets of JEE Advanced 2017. As soon as, I left the centre it started raining, I was like, did I perform that bad, even God is crying. I reached home, it was 7 in the evening and solutions were out from Resonance. I locked myself in a room, started matching from the physics section, and oops, the first three answers were incorrect. The ache in my heart triggered, blood pressure went up, confidence was in the mantle of the earth, instead, I went on. Then the most dramatic thing happened, I opened ‚ÄúRank Predictor 2017‚Äù xD. Yes. IITR or IITG CSE it is, confidence went to Mars before Elon Musk SpaceX. Now here I am, writing the AWL, Harshit Verma, IITK CHE, well S got replaced by H, no regrets, beautiful memories, a lot to take back. You remember the rain on 21stMay, god cried because he was not awarded the bonus marks by IITM xD.",
      "It was a beatific sunny morning, after the rain stormed Kanpur a night before, yes guys, again xD, I do not know what connection this rain has with me. It was the 22ndof July 2017, the day Y17 first time stepped on campus, with a sack full of enthusiasm, hope and excitement. Having read all the funny incidents on Quora, I was excited as well as nervous. To be honest, Chemical Engineering at IIT Kanpur was never a strong preference for me. My family being full of Mechanical Engineers, I was called ‚ÄúChm-Akal‚Äù as a witty remark xD. Being from Kanpur, and having visited the campus multiple times before, an entry into the campus was not that exciting for me, but the excitement was what is kept ahead. The first person I met here was this person whom we called a Baapu. Extremely thin guy, a small blow of air is enough for him to take off, with an extremely gentle voice, standing on the reception, showed me my room D-209 H5, which was FCC packed with two beds, one table, I was like ‚Äì ‚ÄúYe kya h, isme kon rhega!‚Äù. Now at present, D209 instead of having two beds and one table has an infinite number of memories. The second person I met is not my roomie, instead, a tall guy, taller than me, cleaning his room, I was stunned by his height, ‚Äúmere se lamba‚Äù, and that guy later became one of my closest friends I have at IITK, KreeRonan xD.",
      "On the very first night, the reality of senior-junior interaction kicked in only on my first GBM. The executives of Hall 5 jampacked us in the TV room, locked the door, the atmosphere in the room was made such that in just 5 minutes I felt unconscious, a consequence of not having Lunch and Dinner lmao, and there was like ‚Äì ‚Äúuthao isko, kya hogya‚Äù, and then my eyes opened in Health Centre, my Bapu and Chacha were there in HC, both shocked. The days of orientation, the Zumba session, and the Harlem Shake competition, well we won the competition, #DMID Forever, was one of the best days that I had spent in IITK.",
      "In the first semester, I had a habit, back from JEE days of extreme competition, due to which I remain unsatisfied with my quiz performance, even though marks were above average, I tried to go to a single concept repeatedly, which in consequence brought a huge lag with the lectures in my courses, henceforth my Midsem performance was drastic. The Midsem event had a huge impact on me and on the top this homesickness was killing me inside, as I have never been away far from my family, I was in a state of anxiety, distress and depression. I started to doubt my capabilities. I used to sit on the OAT rooftop for hours just overthinking about what was going on in my life. I literally remember how I went to each room in my wing, CS Office, those talks with counsellors, telling them my plan to drop IITK, all those crying and stuff that I did. How stupid I was in 1st-year xD, but it is common and is normal, nothing to scream out. It would have been impossible for me, to be who I am at present (frivolous, jubilant, you know this if you have ever interacted with me ) and how I overcame that situation of the first semester if I have been not blessed with such great friends and Bhais in IITK, Lambora, Samu, Amru, Ramji, Bandar, Akshat, Dhamaka, Yadav, TP and many more, and a big, big thank to my Bapu, my hero at IITK, Bharat Jindal, for supporting me throughout my struggle in the first semester. Jayant made a perfect roommate, with whom I share a very special bond. I was now well adjusted to life at IITK and had made lots and lots of good friends. But I did pay the price for it, My Grades! All this chaos, eventually lead to an SPI of 7.56 in the first semester, with a lovely C (called Sikka) in ESC101A xD. Well, Branch Change was not my cup of tea so not that downhearted though with the SPI.",
      "The first year then passed away, and so the dream of Branch Change of almost all the batch students. Those night outs completing TA assignments, Baap Treats (we looted our Baap too much, I recommend you too :P, just call him/her after perusing this xD). This time, in the second semester, I tried my best on academics, with utmost confidence and discipline, being consistent with the lectures (which I guess is the key), I ended up with a fair SPI of 8.8 in the second semester, I still don‚Äôt know why there is a course of LIF101A, bitching it, as I lost A grade by 0.5 %, small matters :)). I made peace with the fact that I was going to stay in chemical engineering. In the summers, I stayed back and did a departmental project.",
      "In the second year, I met my so-called CHE Batchmates, especially Aviral, we were about to face all the heat of courses together, and hence we bonded strongly for the tough times that lay ahead. It was time to find a new goal and get my act together. After a small internship that I did in a Nuclear Power Plant in winters, it was crystal clear that my interest lies in Core chemical, and back from then, I pushed my limits to explore my department and the opportunities it offers. I started taking core chemical courses seriously with interest. Things were getting back on track on the academic‚Äôs fronts, and I was open to getting involved somewhere on the campus, and then I joined Chemineers.",
      "Halfway into the journey, I was happy, having scored double dassa in the second year (not flaunting xD) maybe it is the product, if you go through things with deep interest, desire, and consistency, you will surely get astonishing results. In conclusion, my grades and CPI improved a lot, having done multiple departmental projects and a core intern, I felt a step closer to getting my dream intern in a reputed core chemical company. On the personal front, I was also spending the golden summertime with my friends, that awesome Goa Trip which we did at the start of summer of 2019 was the best experience for me (I recommend you guys to plan a trip, even planning is fun xD), playing cards, those PUBG night outs, bulla sessions, DPL (cricket), Little did I know that things were going to get pretty bad for me really soon.",
      "When summers of 2019 ended, mighty storms of the intern session were ahead of me because I was applying for core interns only, there were only a few opportunities available for me, ITC, HUL, Reddys and that is it, rest of other companies arrive late. During the intern, on Day 1, I nailed the Group Discussion for ITC quite well, but by some unearthly power, I was unable to crack the GD for HUL. That was the first shock to me, on Day 1 itself, the next day the other breakdown happened, ITC did not qualify a single CHE student, that‚Äôs it for Day 1. Everything seems to be over, no core intern, I was devastated. During these tough times, I had constant support and motivation from Aviral. From practising GDs at night after a long busy day to some random debates, I have spent some of my toughest and best moments with them. I feel one should never lose hope and continue believing in himself/herself however adverse the situation becomes because one day surely the hard work pays off and things turn out your way. On 22ndAugust 2019 came, showcasing the core skills, this time being precautious, I got my internship offer at Dr Reddy‚Äôs. After my intern offer, the ‚ÄúVaastu‚Äù of my wing changed, within a week, almost everyone got their internship, I do not know, maybe I was the gamechanger üôÇ xD.",
      "Then, after the intern, things started getting better. We used to go to the morning classes without breakfast, MT used to be our department hangout place after morning classes for important debates on some useless topics, Labs which we just somehow managed to go on time, surprize quizzes at 8 AM in the morning, that I somehow managed to attend. Going to sleep at 4 AM and waking up at 7:50 AM regularly is the most difficult yet exciting thing that campus life offers to you. I just enjoyed the remaining time of the semester with my wingies, playing PUBG, outings, dinners and parties. We all were happy back then, enjoying to the fullest, and then we were struck by CoVID. It was the most unanticipated thing which happened across the campus.",
      "Surviving the pandemic, the online virtual intern, online courses for more than a year, led to a 0.5 increase in eye power, better typing and googling skills and good MooKIT skills xD. We got a truthrevealer32 who made my and my batchmates life like hell xD, still don‚Äôt know who he is. Meanwhile, I got the pre-placement offer from Dr Reddys. I got the core professional success I had wanted all through my campus life. Later, we planned a trip to Rajasthan, in December 2020, yes you heard it right ‚Äì we did a trip in the middle of the pandemic, as to be together and had fun, as we realized that we would be heading home and not back to the campus to finish the final chapter, yet again it was an exciting trip, thanks to god, no one got infected. Kudos to the administration for calling us back in March, although we were sent back home, we lived one and half months on the campus, in those serene rooms with loving friends. We almost lived the whole 4 years of the campus life again and for the last time in those few months. In the short-lived yet fantastic last semester, I reconnected with all my friends and had the most amazing times, badminton, cricket, rubish ki report xD, Mama-Mio, 3 AM bullas, parties, made an excellent full stop to those lovely days.",
      "The journey was sure a rollercoaster ride, it had its ups and downs, it was the people that made the journey possible what it is. The best part of the campus life will surely be the friends that I have made throughout the ride. From making awesome friends in my wing, Rohit, Samarthya, Akshat, Shubham, Sohail, Abhishek, Vikram, to learning and attending CHE classes with Aviral, Anirban, Atishay, and many more, I have enjoyed every moment of the process. To add to the ‚Äòlearning‚Äô, I am lucky to have a friend like Aviral who not only supported me throughout in those late-night mug ups before endsem but also helped me in taking the proper life decisions xD. Those table discussions in mess will be remembered. It‚Äôs a big thank you to IIT Kanpur for being the host and providing me with such career opportunities, skills and the most important the loving friends, which will be together for my whole life. It was unfortunate that I wouldn‚Äôt have the entire stay, but this is how experienced is, this is what life is. Coming to end, (if you are still reading a big thankyou ‚ô°) I wish all the upcoming batches enjoy their time, make good friends, expand their interaction circle, talk to seniors, and make their best memories here at IIT Kanpur.

      "Ishika Singh is a Y16 student who double majored in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering departments. She talks about how she found her own interests and made a last minute change in plans. Read to find out!",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "College has made me feel both the best and the worst about myself! I entered IITK as an introverted, ignorant chemical engineering student with general, vague interests, and I am going out as a self-assured (ambivert) machine learning researcher (without any intent to attach the adjectives with the designations :D. Also, I didn‚Äôt qualify for a BC). My explorations were wider than I thought I could or would do, given the limited college timeframe and all the drama it accompanies. I decided to get into ML research in my 4th year, so it was far from a straightforward choice. This is also why I feel assured about it. I am grateful to IITK for the journey that made this choice as much apparent to me.",
      "As you might have guessed, this story is about how to find ‚Äúyour thing‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt already know), switch fields at the last minute, what matters from that perspective, and what does not. For the first 3 years, I explored many domains, including electronics, chemical engineering research and industry (aka core), startups, finance, ML engineering and research, etc. To learn more about my interests and develop other dimensions of my personality, I also participated in extra humanities courses, cultural/sports/social/organizational activities, and even SSAC. People did say that I‚Äôm going too broad and that I should be getting more focused by then, which is honestly scary when you still don‚Äôt know what to converge on. The final realization of what appeals the most to me (or what I still don‚Äôt hate :P) came during my 3rd-year internship at HUL. A career in ML research seemed apt, from the three aspects vital to me: intellectual interest, financial intents, and whether it benefits society somehow. Howsoever late, the exploration solved the ‚Äúpassion‚Äù mystery for me, well, at least for the next decade or so ;).",
      "I was aware that this was my last year at IITK. Yet, I was ready to take the hit by letting go of all easy career options after HUL and starting afresh. I could do so because I was motivated towards a future where my work made sense from the three perspectives listed above. I took up a second major in CSE in the 7th sem and worked hard both on current research projects and getting more projects. With less than 1% application success (or 99% failure) rate, I got 3 projects in hand (each with a certain fraction of supervision, to ensure that I don‚Äôt stagnate). I tried my best to get something out of all 3 in parallel within a year. My luck played well thereafter, maybe because luck is just proportional to focused hard work. After this phase, I secured a job at Adobe Research and CS PhD (USC) and MS (CMU) admits, finally putting an end to this ‚Äúfield switching battle‚Äù. Therefore, balancing hard work with getting things done helped me achieve my ‚Äúgoals‚Äù. Also, maintaining a decent grade average (regardless of one‚Äôs branch) usually makes switching (and many other things) easier. However, it is not impossible otherwise too. Among other things, I also followed the academic twitter and actively engaged in (free registration virtual) conferences as much as possible. This expanded my perspective about research, life as a researcher and brought diverse engagement opportunities right into my feed.",
      "In the beginning, I used to think that the PhD dream might be too far-fetched as both my majors and the resume points were completely unrelated. I thought that I might always be stuck in the lesser end of the ML research circle. I might have settled for a data science job back then, and I was confused when I had to choose between that and doing a second major during the placements in 7th sem. But turns out that the aim was achievable; I just had to keep at it (without sacrificing any sleep :D). All of that was very challenging (and hence fun), both academically and emotionally, yet very feasible. I gave up much of my social life and entertainment hours during the first half of that year(and the pandemic forced me to give it up in the latter half). But my friends played an important role throughout. We (Gargi, Anant, Aditya) used to rant about our defeats and celebrate all our small and big wins by eating delicious but utterly unhealthy food. Prof. Shivali, Shivani, and Maneet have been the best teachers, I totally owe them all my good grades, except that they are not professors; they are my friends! And I owe Shreya for being consistently boring and available whenever I needed, and everyone else who was a part of my journey. I finally know that ‚Äúthe top 5 people on your list around you largely define your personality‚Äù is true, which also implies the importance of the company you have. Sometimes you can consciously choose your friends and acquaintances, and sometimes you can‚Äôt. The best strategy is to keep working on yourself and let the law of attraction do the rest üòâ (while also taking the initiative to connect when possible). Peer learning has helped me to a great extent. Throughout my 5 years, my approach was always to learn different skills from my peers instead of competing with them. There are many great people on campus, and they are usually approachable. You should try to get the info you need from them. Although a part of my story had a happy ending, it was far from being perfect. I regret missing out on connecting to several cool people on campus, both because of being occupied and my introversion.",
      "College is so much more than this article or all As We Leave articles combined. I have shared whatever was important to me and maybe unique to my journey. These 4 years are the most densely packed experiences on anyone‚Äôs timeline, and the more one engages, the denser it gets. It‚Äôs like another world where you take birth in the first year and pass out in the last, with a drastic amount of upgrades and several secrets of life revealed. It‚Äôs a whole life within a life, characterized by all the emotions, cliffs and craters. Live it through, fail a lot and win a lot, figure out who you are, add value to other lives, and acquire a personality you can look up to ‚Äì somewhat inspired and somewhat idiosyncratic!",

      "Anshul Yadav is a Y16 graduating student in the Department of Civil Engineering. He talks about his journey at IITK and how he navigated his way through his undergraduate degree.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "Well, as I sit on my desk recollecting all my memories of the last five years (maybe four, damn you, COVID!! -_-) of my college life, I ponder upon the things I should tell you. Should I tell you about the extraordinary and adventurous escapades (and ofc my first GBM <3), or emphasize the extra special friendly bonds I was fortunate to have. Should I advise you on how you should deal with being at IIT-K, like a letter to my past self, or should I dictate an unbiased narrative summary of what I went through and let you take your own decisions? Just to be thorough, I went through the articles previously submitted to Vox, and it is no surprise that people have already covered almost all the things I had to say. Not left with much creative freedom, I fear my article would be rendered redundant by the reader (O! sweet alliteration, see, I should be studying literature instead xD). Anyway, let me tell you my secrets, a reflection on my decision-making process, things I may or may not have told anyone before. My decisions might sound stupid at first glance, but I guess if I acquaint you with what went through my mind while taking them, I might convince you otherwise (or not, who cares. Lol). Before that, however, like a good writer always does, let me acquaint you, my reader, with myself. I entered IIT-Kanpur as a freshman in Civil Engineering and will be graduating with a bachelor‚Äôs in it and a master‚Äôs in GIS (you don‚Äôt have to know what that is). After graduating, my current plans are to join the Texas A&M University as a doctoral student (I have no idea why I am opting for more boredom by staying in academia), and on the conventionally interesting human being scale, I‚Äôd be too close to the origin to be considered amicable. So why should you care about what I am going to tell you? Because, through the eyes of a cold-hearted sociopath, the world has a different tint, which might or might not be helpful for you.",
      "The first ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù choice I made was my department. With a CRL rank of 1571, why did I choose CE at IIT Kanpur? Well, partly because of my father‚Äôs influence who wanted to see me as a civil engineer (and later as a civil servant as well) and partly because of my discussion with Dr Partha Chakraborty, my friend Promit‚Äôs dad, who convinced me that CE is indeed very intricate and beautiful. But you know what, the most compelling reason for me choosing CE was arrogance. I was thrilled by the challenge that I could give something back to CE to make a difference. That I was talented enough to contribute and avenge its tarnished image of not being among the first choices of first-year students. Well, in hindsight, I don‚Äôt think I have been more horribly wrong in evaluating myself ever since. IITs are mad places with mad people doing maddening stuff, and I (who believed he was the best kid in Y16 CE) was nowhere near. It‚Äôs an unspoken truth, but IIT Kanpur is quite like a feudal society, with some departments being aristocratic and others lying in the peasantry in direct correlation to the returns associated with them. In my opinion, however, this divide is more a matter of perception than truth and is often propagated through a series of myths, some of which I too came across during my freshman years.",
      "They said, in CE, you won‚Äôt get placed in the first two days, yet one of my friends did exactly that in the first slot of the recruitment drive. They said, if you do get placed, the chances are that you will never earn as much, and yet, one of my friends went on to become one of the highest package holders on the entire campus. They said you‚Äôd surely fail if you don‚Äôt have it figured out as early as possible what you want to do in your life, and yet one of my friends began working from scratch in his third year and went on to get into JPMC. They also said research in CE is sub-par, there aren‚Äôt any opportunities, yet one of my friends went to secure one of the only two places in the prestigious Honda YES scholarship to Japan, competing against many excellent candidates from a multitude of departments. Finally, they said CE is boring, it‚Äôs nothing more than construction and materials, and yet, here I am, madly in love with the subject, so much so that I have decided to do it for my entire life. Well, maybe I just had some freakishly talented friends, and mind you, I do feel very fortunate to have shared my classes with such amazing people, but I would still place my faith in the notion that all departments have splendid opportunities if you do not approach them with a rejectionist‚Äôs attitude",
      "Anyway, countless people would have told you already that IIT-K is unique because of its people and the bonds we create. Well, it is accurate, and I feel no shame in repeating the cliche. However, a few people are bonds with whom are more memorable than others; they are not just your friends; they are ‚Äòfamily,‚Äô they are your wingmates (often both figuratively and literally xD). I am glad of all the memories I created, and it would be an injustice if I don‚Äôt mention how much I have been missing them ever since. These guys have always been there for me throughout my life as it ebbed and flowed. Mind you; I just had the best roommate, the best neighbours, the best second neighbours, ‚Ä¶ eh, you get the drift. I just had pretty much the best wing I could have ever had. However, there‚Äôs one more person without whom my story is incomplete. She inspired me to be the best version of myself with each passing second, and I owe her whatever little I could achieve.",
      "Life was good, honestly, until I marred it myself. Maybe, imagine being alone in your room, desperately trying to get through each day of the most demanding semester (which is hands down the fifth for CE) you ever faced, compounded with a feeling of worthlessness that you would feel after eleven research internship programs rejected you in a row, and then you get diagnosed with a chronic condition which will plague you for your entire life. What would you do? Don‚Äôt look at me, for I made the stupidest choice possible. I retired into a cocoon. The ‚ÄúCocoon of despair.‚Äù I was too scared to face my insecurities, let alone share them with people I trusted, and hence did the worst thing possible. I chickened out. I ran away from everyone and everything. The weight of my insecurities led me to believe that I was worthless. Maybe, if I could have mustered up the courage to share what I felt with the amazing people I had around me, it could have been better. You know, all your bonds are like plants; you need to water them, take care of them regularly, and yet in precise amounts. You can‚Äôt flood the field with affection and care, and you also can‚Äôt let it dry up with your sociopathic tendencies.",
      "As Mrs Elm said to Nora, ‚ÄúRegrets don‚Äôt leave. They aren‚Äôt mosquito bites. They itch forever. And sometimes regrets aren‚Äôt based on fact at all.‚Äù",
      "Time doesn‚Äôt heal stuff; it just makes you realize and probably justify your regrets. So, reach out to people you trust and share with them what you feel while you still have the opportunity. I know that this is a bit hypocritical, but sometimes a hypocrite is just a person changing. I know I didn‚Äôt do it, but I should have.",
      "Anyway, so what do you, a self-important individual, do when you get rejected eleven consecutive times. Well, you just try for the twelfth, and that is precisely what I did as well. Luckily, the last program I applied to selected me, and off I went to board my life‚Äôs first international flight to the US. It was fun ‚Äî the summer. Quite instrumental in solidifying my resolve for what I had to do for my entire life. Travelling abroad is often a gateway to new cultures, which is exciting. However, these opportunities also presented me with a feeling of freedom and empowerment in my solitude. After a long time, I finally felt happy. I was doing something I liked and had made peace that I wasn‚Äôt the best in the business. However, the fact that motivated me throughout was my resolve to be better than what I was in the previous moment. My objective, ever since, has been with me bettering myself. See, that‚Äôs how college changes you for the better. It makes you more mature than you are when you join by providing you with opportunities that widen your parochial perspectives.",
      "The fourth and fifth years of my college life were filled with a plethora of exciting things; most of them, however, had blazing starts before being extinguished by COVID-19. I picked up tennis, probably the best decision I took. Went out to the movies and random eat-outs with my friends. Went back to sketching and writing poetry. I started running again. Went to Japan in the winters. Did things that once made me feel whole. I learned a lot, played a lot, smiled a lot more. Live a lot in the process. And now, when I am on the verge of saying goodbye to this fantastic place I considered home for five long years, I am very sure, earnestly, I wish to go back to my first day and live it all again. Over and over again.",
      "So, in conclusion, I have no idea what I should say. As you would have established by now, my story is pretty ordinary, and the events that populated my college life do not provide me with an inheritance to preach. However, I will leave you with some advice that I recommend you follow if you see value in me. First, don‚Äôt neglect your sleep. We, as young men and women, often see sleeping as wasting away 1/3rd of our day. Don‚Äôt do that. Second, attend all your classes and listen sincerely to what the professor has to say. It drastically reduces the time you have to spend with your subjects, which you can utilize elsewhere. Third, always talk to people at least two years older than you for advice. People just senior to you will often tell you fluffy stuff with little substance in it. And lastly, make friends and a lot of them. It indeed is the best thing IIT-K has to offer. Finally, stay safe, follow your passions, and don‚Äôt let your failures bog you down. Defeats are often more precious than victories. On that note, these are the concluding lines, which have etched onto my heart:",
      "Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude, and my aloofness;You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.",
      "Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,You and I shall laugh together with the storm,And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,And we shall stand in the sun with a will,And we shall be dangerous.-Khalil Gibran.",

      "Hey, :)) This series should be named ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll Never Leave‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòAs We Leave‚Äô because there is something about IITK, which will make you say the same thing even after you‚Äôve spent four years here. I had first visited IITK in an open house organized by the Counselling Service, just after JEE Advanced. That day was like a trailer of the orientation, with good people showing you good places and describing amazing things about the place you were in. As you may have guessed by now, I belong to Kanpur and IITK was not that far away for me. I gave my board exams and UPSEE here at Kendriya Vidyalaya. Hence, I had some foreground to draw my imagination upon when I first thought of choosing IITK. I had the option between Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering. I decided to go with Civil Engineering, despite many Y16s advising against it in the Open House. But I made that choice, because I was told that I will have the option of giving the Civil Services Examination and I was inherently uninterested in chemical equations.",
      "First day at campus, was a bit acquainted for me because I had asked every question one could from the seniors before coming here. Some of my coaching buddies also joined IITK, so I was comfortable with people as well. New faces, new opportunities for new bonds to form. Then the orientation went in a flash, with all the colorful lineups drilling through rainy mornings and sunny afternoons. The blue folder brings it all back at one glance, and then I can spend hours counting the memories from that 8-day long weekend. But, let‚Äôs move on from there to the first lecture. I rode on the back of my roommate‚Äôs cycle to the academic area, finding L20 was quite a challenge! MTH101-PHY103-ESC101 in that order, they came and went, and I was so excited about the first day that I could not pay attention to anything. Then on repeat, this was pretty much my first semester. One difference, I had to learn cycling after the first week of classes (acknowledgement to the person on whose cycle I would take most rides, even though I knew how to cycle :P). Only 1 course that interested me was Introduction to Psychology, and I have taken that interest seemingly forward. Then came Freshers‚Äô Night, E-summit, Udghosh, Antaragni, etc and I made sure I was a part of everything (except, Antaragni because that is to have fun ;)). The first semester was pretty much about asking, knowing and exploring for me. But, hold on, we left academics behind right? I got 6.7 SPI in first semester and I wasn‚Äôt happy. I knew it was terrible and had to do something. So, now I did something that you will laugh at. I spent the winters studying CHM102-MTH102-PHY102 and even LIF101 for the next semester.",
      "Back to the campus for the second semester, I was motivated to score well this time, but without missing out on the extra-curriculars. Okay, this time some of the courses were going well. I still participated in many things, but my SPI improved this time and it was 7.3. I know, not much of a miracle but something I could term as progress.",
      "Summers 2018 were quite a joyride. I made a mix of 1 course, 2 summer school courses from CSE, 2 or 3 club workshops, and Udghosh senior executive work. Morning to evening, I was busy with something or the other, and one month went by. Then I went home for one month to relax.",
      "Before the third semester began, I was an SG and had 6 cute bacchis. They were so cute, that on day one when I had to struggle through the rain to reach the TA202 lab with mud and water all over me, they made my evening by planning an amazing surprise with a yummy molten chocolate cake as a Thank You party for the orientation. I chose to continue with Udghosh for this semester as I enjoyed a lot with the team there. It was even more fun with the junior executives joining this time. Udghosh 2018 was a success(no matter what people say). First year ended without a branch change. On day 4 of Antaragni 2018, one Y16 senior said to me ‚ÄòCivil ke logo ka to placement hi nahi hota‚Äô and I know it sounds silly that I believed him, but I did, and I still remember how much I doubted my choice that day. That day, my best friend told me that I am listening to the views of second yearites from other branches, who do not know much about placements themselves yet and that I should maybe consult someone whose shoes are more similar to mine. I want anyone reading this article to take this piece of advice to with them. We hear a lot from others, because things here work on connections, by asking your seniors. But not everything we hear is true. Talking about the academic performance this semester, I got an SPI of 8.8, thanks to Notes Gallery. I felt more confident academically and decided to maintain this trend.",
      "Winters 2018, I applied for the core team of Udghosh. But, I did not go for the Udghosh core team interviews. Why? Because I didn‚Äôt want to spend my summers working for 6 hours a day on something that would not make me learn. In Udghosh, I had worked on content and media partnerships. I felt pretty much saturated on that, and I also aimed at moving towards a higher CPI. So, in my fourth semester, I did TA201A, left Techkriti 2019 team, tried to take up MSO201A but was more than happy with HSO201A and prepped for internships! After a session by SPO on Summer Internships, I geared up to spend my summers with a Research Project, competitive programming and some Coursera courses. The fun part: Banaras photowalk.",
      "The internship season began before the next semester. I had secured a day 1 interview, as opposed to 3 or 4 for people from the top 3 branches. By this time, I had a double major in economics as a backup, in case I am unable to secure a placement. (Spoiler alert: You know this did not happen as I am writing As we leave in 2021) . I reached the interview venue at 11 am and gave all the rounds till 5pm. After this, I was told that I have been selected, but boo! The hiring team made a mistake and apparently, I was not selected. I was really sad that day not because I was rejected but because of the way I was rejected. But with the support of my friend(again, the same one) I was able to concentrate on what was importantnow.After about 10 days I got the internship at Mastercard as a data engineer. Then I had only one goal to help my batchmates secure an internship. I forgot to mention working in a group, even if it is the two of you, will be tremendously beneficial because one, it will be difficult to get off-track and two, someone will always be there. In the fifth semester, with four labs, innumerable bonds were formed. SPI: 8.9",
      "The next semester was important because civil peeps have to select their first open electives now. The pre-registration for this semester had us one our toes, tipping from one professor‚Äôs office to another. Sixth semester started well, filled with night outs and casual dinners, kyunki civil valon ki bhi internship lagti hai :P. There was one lab course this semester, and that got completed just before the midsem. As we all know, the pandemic hit us after this. This semester ended in July. SPI: 9.3. By this time you start getting nostalgic because this is your fourth year.",
      "My internship period was reduced to one month, in work from home mode. I got a PPO, and I dropped the double major. The seventh semester as well begun online. Classes were converted to zoom meetings and appointments were converted to mails, exams became fastest scanner first competition. I enjoyed my time at home and hence SPI: 9.8.",
      "Just when we had accepted that this semester was also going to be online, we were called back to the campus. Even though I was on the campus only for one and a half months, with many restrictions, got quarantined three times, but it was a fantastic time. This short time felt like many months and we had more fun than what we would have had if covid didn‚Äôt happen.",
      "The takeaway from my journey is simple. Have faith in yourself, have a person who keeps reminding you that. Sometimes you will feel disheartened, but make sure you bounce back higher. Smile when you see someone, because it may make their day and be the source of the facts no one told you. Carve your own path and stay informed.",

      "Note to the reader. If you are here looking for some internship or placement stories or professional advice, you are better off scourging through SPO‚Äôs website or stalking my prodigious batchmates. Instead, this will be a narration of unsolicited insights and meta-perspective I developed during my life here @IITK. Things I wish I could tell my younger self.",
      "It all started like every other guy who has just cleared JEE. I was not satisfied with my rank and branch. I wanted to switch my branch to Computer Science because that is what ‚Äúseemed‚Äù closest to what I wanted to pursue. And for this, I forwent almost every opportunity to explore my interests during the first year. Be it on the Cultural or the SnT side, with the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù plan that I can always pursue them later during the first year summers. My first mistake was‚Äútrying to live tomorrow‚Äù.Luckily, I managed to get a branch change to CSE. Everything seemed worthwhile since I had the area I could work in with some genuine interest. Only to realise down the line I might have been better off taking MTH instead. But you never know when life throws you a curveball.The summer after my first year, I learnt that my mother had been diagnosed with Cancer during the end sems. My parents being deaf and me being the only child, it was essential for me to help them manage the subsequent surgery and chemotherapy sessions and be a pillar of support for them. This carried on not only till my summers but also a heavy portion of my second year and later years as well. Travelling to and fro between Delhi and Kanpur, missing out on classes, and taking my peers‚Äô help to catch me up with assignment deadlines and exams. And down the drain went all my ‚Äúexploration‚Äù plans. For a while, I used to justify my inactions with the story that it was merely an unfortunate turn of events that led to my missing out on things. Otherwise, I would have become the next big name on campus.However, to face the truth, that does not explain my not filling the core team nomination form for the Counselling service when honestly I was too lazy to follow through with a 4-page form. My ignorance of not taking up a key position in the ANC Council when deep down I did not want to prepare a PPT or go through an entire day of grilling interviews. And many other opportunities I ‚Äúmissed‚Äù.¬† It was not my circumstances but my lazy attitude and self-sabotaging tendencies to be blamed. Because guess what? Every person around you has their own struggles. You just don‚Äôt know about them.",
      "I didn‚Äôt realise early on thatThe time I had on this campus was limited. Opportunities today would cease to exist tomorrow.The aftermath of realising this paramount truth comes the self loathing and feeling alienated . If you already are in a sticky place like I was then, Steponeis to be easy on yourself and¬† to forgive yourself for the time you have lost. Steptwois to introspect and rediscover yourself, what ambitions you want to pursue and what opportunities will lead you to them. Stepthreeis toACTon it. The rest will follow. Stepfouris to have faith.Cherish every opportunity you get.When an opportunity presents itself, which it will, pounce at the first sight of it. If you want to explore something, join a new club, research something, try a new sport, etc., do it! Truly hesitate to dilly dally around it. Keep reminding yourself that a day will soon arrive when you would have to leave this heaven behind. Do not fear to truly grab any challenge by its horns. So that one day down the line, you don‚Äôt have to bear the thought of what would have happened had you preferred the road not taken üôÇ",

      "In essence IITK itself is way too diverse to be completely explored and way too colorful to be¬† fully perceived by one soul. And from these differences, from our own self and experiences¬† originate judgments. And hence my second mistake.‚ÄúTo have personal biases‚Äùabout clubs, societies, seniors, courses, departments, professors, people, career paths, and whatnot. Thankfully, I realized pretty soon the futility and stupidity of it all. There is more to people and things than what you might see on the surface. And more importantly, the freedom to make decisions and form opinions does not necessarily translate to good choices if you are not well-informed and have hard-lined biases.SoDrop all preconceived notions, explore and take your own damn responsibility.Don‚Äôt let the opinions of your seniors or friends or people, in general, determine what activities or sports or classes or clubs you take part in. It‚Äôs always good to reach out to people for advice, but the final call must be yours.",
      "{Pro Tip (especially for freshers) for advice or general fundae, ask seniors at least two years above your batch. Your immediate seniors are people like you and may speak out of their freshly developed biases.

      "Rather go meta. When you look upto people, don‚Äôt always look at what they did but How they did it.¬† Learn from the processes that people employ to keep them on their toes, to be organized and cognizant, and use them to pursue things that you‚Äôre genuinely interested in. If you‚Äôre having fun doing something, then keep on pursuing it. Be conscious of being peer-pressured to explore every unexpected opportunity or fill up every call for a nomination form that pops up on your webmail.

      "Shobhit Jagga is a Y17 undergraduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He writes about his journey through 4 years of IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "I start off by saying that IITK isn‚Äôt paradise, just to highlight that life in it isn‚Äôt always pleasant which makes it all the more interesting and memorable, especially when you look back. If I‚Äôve become any better from when I joined to when I graduate, it is by lifting myself up when encountered with challenges that this life posed. The setbacks, especially the unexpected ones, teach you not to take things for granted. They remind you to discard some of the societal notions and stereotypes that you unconsciously imbibe in yourself being a part of the IITK community. My endeavour throughout will be to walk you through my experiences at IIT Kanpur in a manner that you don‚Äôt find it too much to go through and hopefully decipher if there‚Äôs anything to be learned, anything inspirational lying within it. If not anything else, I hope you‚Äôd atleast like the two anecdotes towards the end of this article.",
      "To begin with, I‚Äôll give you a bit of background. Before I came to college, I was someone who found it difficult to be involved socially, all credits to me being a little low on self-confidence. Furthermore, I did not have a clear sense of what I wanted to do in life, and to be brutally honest, my only reason to land up in this branch in this college was my JEE rank. Coming to my hobbies, I had played badminton with my brother a lot before JEE and was hopeful of getting selected in CPA (just that I did not). I was excited to begin college life, anticipating a lot of fun and memories by graduation.",
      "",
      "I got along with my wingies, with whom I had a lot of fun in bulla sessions, birthday parties in OAT, fests, PE sessions, etc. I gave time to academics as well, not as much as JEE of course, but I did not get the result I had expected or imagined for myself initially. Added to that, even in the non-academic sphere, discouraging events began to degrade my faith in my capabilities by the end of my first year. But having recently entered college, things were all fun and frolic for me and I was optimistic for things to improve in my second year.",
      "My first presentable achievement, as I call it, was becoming an SG. This, and that our SnT summer project ended nicely and we won the best summer project award. I felt satisfied and it dawned on me that I too have something in me, that I did actually fit in. I really enjoyed the Y18 orientation, more than my own orientation, if I may say so. For most parts, I believe I made more friends in this period than in my previous 2 semesters.",
      "Now comes the time for the downward journey of this roller coaster ride, my third semester. I decided to become the hall captain in Takneek, which eventually for me turned out to be the most wrongly judged decision. I wasn‚Äôt able to do justice to the role and to myself. The lack of proper management from my side raised the workload for my companions, which is something I regret to this day. If not anything else, this experience was highly instrumental in molding me in terms of how I pursued things later. My midsem performance left me dumbfounded. I really wasn‚Äôt expecting such a bad performance in multiple courses. So the rest of the semester passed in my attempts to improve my performance, to correct whatever had gone downhill. As luck would have it, even my sincere efforts weren‚Äôt paying back, leaving me frustrated and helpless for most parts. I routinely felt that I did not belong here and that all this wasn‚Äôt suited for me. For me personally, it was in this semester that I experienced an all-time low because it felt as though nothing was going my way. I would say, feeling like you‚Äôre not capable of doing something despite your sincere efforts is one of the worst feelings one could have.",
      "I‚Äôm glad that I persevered, that I had friends who talked me through and gave me hope, that I did not give up on my efforts, that things finally improved. One major takeaway for me at this point is that howsoever trivial it may sound, it is important to realise that even though your wellwishers would support you, it is you who has to make things happen by introspecting yourself before going on to blame the circumstances as a first thought. If I have to pinpoint why I failed in the previous one, I believe it was because I began taking things for granted and placed intelligence above hardwork. Others have repeatedly emphasised that I‚Äôm intelligent/chaapu because of my IITian (and with CSE branch) nature that I might have placed lesser weight to the fact that I was in this place because of my hardwork not intelligence. Fourth semester onwards, I could see my efforts translated to outputs gradually, which might sound so normal and reasonable but felt like a blessing to me. Honestly, I have enjoyed the time since. I had ample opportunities to get involved with PORs as we call them, but the pros would never outweigh the cons in my mind and I would do something else, something seemingly better. I would choose to spend my time in seemingly fascinating opportunities over any other option which is hyped in the campus or which seems to be helpful in my career/courses in some way.",
      "In my third year, I had to change my wing (in the sense of wingmates) since all the single rooms in my initial wing were full by the time I came back. This brought me the fortune of having what you can call a dual citizenship. I had been involved in electronics club and team ERA in my second year but from now onwards, most of my time was spent in academic stuff and happily playing football with my wingies until it was all disrupted by covid19.",
      "I hadn‚Äôt given up on badminton all this time. I wasn‚Äôt selected for CPA, but was enthusiastic about it nevertheless. I started playing regularly with my wingies in the hall badminton court, after which I eventually began going to the old sports complex where I played with campus residents, PG, PhD students and even professors who used to come there regularly! I won‚Äôt lie, it took me some time to match their skill and pace level but I made it a habit to go, play and enjoy regularly unless the streak was broken by assignments, sem exams or my own laziness. I was quite satisfied with my performance during my last days at the court and would always cherish those matches and the moments when everyone clapped at my shots (Because why not? :P)",
      "Now, in retrospect, I can understand such lowering of confidence and doubting of self as inescapable in some phase of our life here given that we are among the smartest people in the country. I still remember the incident that brought me to this realisation. During my internship in the US, the topic of IITs came up during my interaction with a resident there. Her remark on knowing that I studied in an IIT was reassuring, to say the least. As she said ‚ÄúOh! The MIT of India‚Äù, I was reminded of being in the company of the smartest people there are in our country. And that it is completely fine to have some difficulty in feeling ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù and that once I actually do, I‚Äôll undoubtedly have crossed the limits my third-semester self would have set for myself.",
      "",
      "Before I move on to the conclusion, I would love to mention two of my fresh memorable anecdotes here. I hope you find them interesting and that they bring a smile to your face in the otherwise unpleasant situation that we have.",
      "Meeting MTH101 professor ‚Äì I met our MTH101 professor in the old sports complex badminton court in my final semester. My firm resolution to beat him in the match as revenge for MTH went in vain. I distinctly remember myself running here and there, missing his shots at me (just as in MTH101 :P). We interacted a bit outside the court which is when I told him that he taught us MTH101 or 102, although I didn‚Äôt exactly remember which. We hit off a great conversation until he asked me ‚ÄúSo, what did you learn from 101?‚Äù. I actually ended up replying literally what I learned ‚Äì ‚ÄúEpsilon-delta stuff‚Äù. I‚Äôm glad that he was polite and replied something on the lines of ‚Äì ‚ÄúYeah, the content becomes a bit complex and advanced to be understood by first yearites.‚Äù It was a total d√©j√† vu moment for me since the same sentence had echoed across the student body repeatedly in the first semester and knowing that the professor felt similarly was amazing.",
      "Meeting our new DOSA ‚Äì This goes back to the only incident when I broke covid protocol on campus (too much bragging, huh?). Would surely remember this incident from when I along with my wingies went for a wing photoshoot to OAT. I‚Äôm not particularly proud or fond of breaking the norms, and for most parts I feel I just did it in the fear of missing out. And well yeah, paid enough for doing so. Just within 10-15 minutes or so of reaching the OAT, we were asked by sis guards to leave. In the event of doing so, we discovered someone standing at the gate who asked us to go and stand in a distance while he called someone else. We got tensed as to who was going to come, and what was going to happen with us. I was personally expecting dosa or director to come when a jeep stopped outside the OAT from which no one but sis guards came out. It was only when the person who had stopped us started to address us that I realized that he was the DOSA himself! All set and done, he asked us to leave campus and sent us back home (actually they had to eventually send everyone back, for reasons you‚Äôre aware of). I told my parents about the incident in the afternoon which happened to be on the same day that my father bought a new SIM card. Later in the evening, I was sitting at my desk when I received a call from an unknown number. I picked it up to listen ‚Äì ‚ÄúHello, this is your Dean speaking‚Äù. Not going to lie, I was truly horrified at the prospect of being chosen and called to ask about my packing progress. ‚ÄúWhat happened in the morning?‚Äù. I replied ‚Äì ‚ÄúUmm actually errr we went to OAT and DOSA sir came there and errr‚Ä¶..‚Äù. My voice was so muffled that my mother took pity at me and shouted ‚Äì ‚ÄúBeta, papa baat kar rahe hain‚Äù. It was then that I came back to my senses and felt relieved.",
      "",
      "For me, IITK was a memorable journey, one that I would always hold close to my heart. It was an important learning phase of life, but that does not mean there is nothing before and after it. I‚Äôm still the person who is a bit low on self-confidence, who finds it difficult to get involved socially and also who is clueless about what exactly to pursue in life. I‚Äôm going for a job, yes, have tried a couple of things, sure, but I still cannot pinpoint something and confidently say that this is something I want to do throughout my life. But as long as I‚Äôm liking what I‚Äôm doing at the moment, it is fine to be unable to visualize where I see myself 5 years down the lane, no? And it‚Äôs fine to be low in confidence when it makes me humble but to make deliberate attempts to improve myself when it results in missed opportunities, no? I‚Äôm just glad that I tried a couple of interesting things which brought me closer to achieving my life goals and was able to satisfactorily live in this phase, among the smartest hard-working people in the country, each of whom had something valuable to teach me. I have figured a lot of things about myself from my interaction with others. And I‚Äôm hopeful to use these experiences and interactions to improve myself further, to find my ‚Äúcalling‚Äù and be what I should be. With this, I wish you all the best for your unique journey at IITK! Feel free to reach out to me if you feel that there is any way I can help you üôÇ",

      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "After postponing for the umpteenth time for different reasons, I finally sat down writing my ‚ÄòAs we leave‚Äô. It couldn‚Äôt be more difficult reminiscing the last five years of my life amid a raging pandemic. Yet, I always wanted to write one to allow myself to revisit one of the best phases of my life, which led to a boy‚Äôs metamorphosis into a man.",
      "It couldn‚Äôt be stressed enough how much this pandemic hurt me and many of the final year plans I had in place for my IITK journey. I wish none of the future batches has to miss the last Dance Extravaganza, the¬† Farewell, the cult photoshoots, a Physical Convocation and a Goodbye.",
      "While going down memory lane, I realised that the period following March 2020 is surprisingly faint in my memory. So I guess this writing would mostly be limited to my in-campus experiences of around four years.",
      "Luckily though, my final month at IITK was my most eventful time. Maybe the divine knew that things are going to turn haywire soon. A fantastic Holi celebration, once in a while Hall-1 ki Baraat, winning Hall 2‚Äôs phatta league, Mafia nights, endless partying in restaurants in Kanpur and capping it off with a successful Goa Tour. I seriously have no idea how I got so carelessly drawn in all these guilty pleasures, having held myself for most of the four years. And I cannot stress how happy I‚Äôm to have lived my life to the fullest towards the end.",
      "But this is not how it all started. Instead, due to some random sequence of successive choices in life, I had landed here. Right from the day I stepped into this campus, the aura engulfed me.",
      "Honestly, after giving up a lot of freedom and pleasure while preparing for JEE, I was revitalised and wanted to enjoy this moment to the fullest, I was still under the impression of what my coaching teachers said to us, ‚ÄòEk baar bas IIT karlo, fir toh life set hai‚Äô.",
      "But reality soon struck hard. I had to make peace with the fact that it‚Äôs not all fun and had to cope with the quizzes that were bombarded much sooner than I would have liked. Having been trained in the JEE setup where you just cannot tolerate being behind others, hard work came impulsively to me to ace yet another rat race.",
      "The IITK culture was initially something that I did not take seriously. Still, I realised how it had carefully evolved itself to create a lasting connection with this place and its people. Witless cheering for your hall, the give it all spirit in inter hall competitions, all culminating at the steps of OAT, seems surreal now.",
      "With all my ‚Äòenthu‚Äô and HEC‚Äôs encouragement, I went on to try my hands at every other thing humanly possible to manage concurrently. From ELS to HSS to Dramatics to Robotics to Electronics to SAE to Aeromodelling to every other sport I could spell, I was there for my hall. Insane hall patriotism, you would feel. Queerly, it followed a gaussian curve. It came crashing down as high and quick as it went up. By the end of the second year, I realised I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage studies and multiple activities simultaneously and ended up prioritising the former. Initially, I had jumped with excitement seeing so many events happening here that too for free‚Äîa plethora of talks, workshops, and what not. I contemplated attending them all. How foolish it all seems now.",
      "My journey through the years here at the outset would look like of a typical decent CPI guy eternally confused between academia and job. I joined IITK Mechanical Engg only to change it to Electrical a year later and then doubled it up with a major in CSE. However, the only deserving A*‚Äôs I had until my last semester were in Chemistry and Biology courses, making me question my engineering choices. The first year ended with heartbreak, with me missing ‚ÄúDouble Dassa‚Äù by the barest of margins, 0.06% to be exact in one of the ‚Äòhated‚Äô MTH courses. Trying to move on, I delved into extracurricular stuff. Always fascinated by cars, I got associated with SAE initially. It was a great learning experience. My second year went with another phase of exploring non-academic activities. I had a stint at BloodConnect, an Academic mentor at Counselling Service, CFO at Electrical Engineering Association and an all-rounder in the IITK Cricket team. Meanwhile, funnily, I was rejected by Vox twice. Yet, I‚Äôm here writing an article for them. Alongside, I had a pretty successful pitching of a product that grew out of a MicrosoftCode.Fun.Dohackathon. Then come the second year summers where I accidentally ended up doing a research internship. After that, I spent time researching ML, waking & sleeping in Delta Lab throughout my senior sophomore year. This dented my CPI a bit but enabled me to sojourn globally. Hesitatingly, I participated in another hackathon by Deloitte, which would turn out to be one of my most unplanned successful expeditions ever. Cometh the fourth year, we got boxed into small single rooms of Hall-1, the wings got broken, and we got an indication that this honeymoon phase will not last forever, and we needed to get our acts together pretty soon.",
      "I can now vouch that IITK gives you enough opportunities to achieve whatever you want in any walk of life. But, simultaneously, it time and again gives you humbling experiences. When you realise that anything you thought you were great at, there is another predestined guy there, that too in your wing ever so often, who does that same thing many times better than you. It may be studies or cricket trivia or quizzing or TT or socialising or whatnot. This realisation is sometimes scary, degrades your morale, and you end up thinking you were nothing but a frog in the well thus far. But one should, on the contrary, use this as an excellent learning opportunity and use it as one of the many steps for reaching the pinnacle in any domain.",
      "The first year went without much of a hassle where the department had not yet kicked in, and we weren‚Äôt expected to have a crystal clear future. But entering the second year, compelled onto thinking for internships and projects, it all came crashing and laid bare my Achilles heel ‚Äì quick decision making. It escalated very quickly from what internships to do to what to do in life. I had no idea. Looking for answers, I wandered from door to door of various ‚Äòsupposedly‚Äò successful seniors. I tried to understand their thought process, which may lead me out of this messy situation that I encounter often and settle this matter once and for all. Soon I realised that most of my immediate seniors were as clueless as I was. Above that, whenever I went to people for advice, it appeared that people had vindicated their decisions in their minds with justifications to even decisions which they had to take on account of helplessness back then and have lost a neutral judgement on the subject now and this led me to a more profound realisation.",
      "At this point, I went onto a deeper question. I had endless philosophical discussions with my roommate on the meaning of life all night and ended up missing morning classes umpteen times. I desperately wished there to be a book or a manual on living a life, too, because even Google couldn‚Äôt help me out with a definite answer on this.",
      "With all the turmoil happening around, I realised just how random things could be when I landed an internship. I applied for some 50 companies, sat for some 20 tests, gave interviews for 5-6 with totally different profiles and got selected in one where I wasn‚Äôt even shortlisted in the first place. And supposedly, this was going to decide the trajectory of my life. I mean seriously, almost no one lands an intern or a job offer consciously in this process. Is our life trajectory so out of our control? Then why am I even fussing about it so much? And how do I now decide whether to continue with this or try something else, not even having the first-hand experience of the paths I left in the previous junction? It will haunt you in the middle of the night. It sucks to watch your friends sorting out their dreams while you are too confused even to have one.",
      "I had sometime back read about the Buridan‚Äôs ass paradox. He famously argues that",
      "Save for ignorance or impediment, a human faced by alternative courses of action must always choose the greater good. Should two courses be judged equal, then the will cannot break the deadlock; all it can do is suspend judgment until the circumstances change, and the right course of action is clear.",
      "Funnily, I‚Äôve always been a victim of this paradox and have been unable to break the deadlock and keep on suspending my judgement for as late as possible. It all started with me taking both Maths and Biology in Class 11th, then me opting for two coaching institutes.Then finally, I did a double major in two engineering streams that were both different from the one I took admission into. Even while JEE counselling, I was dumbstruck in deciding between Bombay Chemical and Kanpur Mechanical and endless more decisions. This time I couldn‚Äôt ride both the boats and hence had to choose one among the equally good options deemed then. Though, looking back, I couldn‚Äôt have been more proud of that decision five years ago. But I still didn‚Äôt know what the purpose of life is? I thought that I might not be wise enough to take this decision at this moment in life, and things would be more apparent as I grow older.",
      "‚ÄúYou think when you reach a certain age, things will start making sense. But, then, you find out you‚Äôre just as lost as you were before.‚Äù",
      "Then I stumbled across a piece of wisdom by a sane senior and have been deeply impacted by it ever since.",
      "The insight I gained from it was that this confusion that I had was not only limited to me but also universal, and it‚Äôs not something that can be termed a current generation issue. It transcends time. The most pragmatic solution to this fix is to choose one of the many directions that you deem good enough, and you would be better off than just thinking about which path to choose. And numerous examples lay the proof that if I just had the strength of will, even if I realise years later that something was off, even with all the responsibilities, it was almost with total certainty that I could act to change where I was and what I was. It takes time to digest this, but it frees you from the paralysis that decision-making often rendered me into when fully internalised.",
      "‚ÄúKyun banun main kisi aur ki tarah, zamaane mein jab koi mujhsa nahi.‚Äù",
      "Nothing in this world is binary. Everything lies in a spectrum from one extreme to another. So, we need not always make the best decision among the million decisions we need to make in life. If we end up taking good enough decisions most of the time, we will end up in a pretty good place in life. Most of the decisions don‚Äôt even matter in the long run, which we fret so much about daily. And we can always switch things in life until we‚Äôre alive.",

      "Whenever you feel down, or things do not seem to be going well, or you failed an exam, just think, will this even matter ten years down the line, and you‚Äôll soon realise how big you had made a small thing in life to.",

      "Which courses do you take? Which clubs do you join? How much CPI do you get? How do you get it? Which companies to sit for? Which sports to choose for CPA? The specifics of any of these won‚Äôt matter, but the resultant effort would compound into a net fruitful result. But once you get out, I can guarantee that you‚Äôll rue the fact that life‚Äôs so dull after college and why I didn‚Äôt do this or that, and you would never be saying why I did this or that?",
      "So, do random stuff and discover your inner self as this is the last time you‚Äôll be enjoying life without the realisation of the merciless society outside, where the baggage of expectations and responsibilities will drown you.",

      "Ultimately it‚Äôs not the specifics of your decisions that impact the final you that comes out of this place; it will be the net sum of all the myriad of experiences and endeavours you take in this journey. Therefore, I believe anything you do here other than doing nothing contributes to the end product you become.",
      "I realised that one quality that would inevitably help you in your stay at IITK would be to say more yes than no to random things. Just think about what could be the worst scenario if you did this and make yourself comfortable with it and if there‚Äôs not much loss in going for a task, don‚Äôt hesitate and at least give it a try. This confusion may be in numerous events, whether it‚Äôs about asking out someone, standing in an election, or applying for a seemingly tough scholarship/internship. Just go for it. Don‚Äôt hesitate to do anything. If there isn‚Äôt much downside to doing/attempting something, go for it! This applies to anything and everything in life and to the decisions that you need to make at every step in life. And even if you fail, remember that ‚ÄúOur lives are defined by opportunities, even the ones we miss.‚Äù",

      "‚ÄúGoodbyes make you think. They make you realise what you‚Äôve had, what you‚Äôve lost, and what you‚Äôve taken for granted.‚Äù",
      "It seems college was meant to teach us a lot about life, accepting that sometimes there won‚Äôt be closure, and we need to learn to live with it. We‚Äôll never forget, though, that we couldn‚Äôt say a final goodbye, but that‚Äôs how life is maybe, and we learned it the hard way.",
      "In the end, ‚ÄòBakchod‚Äô, chaapu, kholna, GPL, ‚ÄòChill hai‚Äô won‚Äôt be mere terms; they will be emotions entrenched in your heart, and your ears will be yearning to hear them once again.",

      "My randomly allocated ‚ÄúBakait‚Äù hostel became my identity,And my wing, my lifeline, obliviously.Deciphering the DoSAs, the DoAAs, and the DoPAsI fell in love with the culture here eventually.",
      "Couldn‚Äôt fathom half of the courses we did here at IITK,Which could supposedly be aced only with all-nighters at the library.Switching from Yantrik Abhiyantriki to Batti and Dabba,I tirelessly raced across KD, RM, CC, NCL and LHCBruised and hurt, landing up exhausted at HC",
      "From battling Fourier Transforms to enjoying Antaragni nights,We endured, we fought, we won, and faltered again as a see-saw!And finally cherished and thought nothing could go wrong,But in the end, a ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô bat ascertained the Murphy‚Äôs law!",
      "The memories will be etched in my heart forever. I never thought the end would be so emotional. You know it‚Äôs love when you have been saying goodbye for this many times, but still, you‚Äôre not ready to leave even in your ‚ÄòAs we leave‚Äô.",

      "Swadha Pandey is a Y17 undergraduate student from the Physics department. She presents her story through 4 years of IITK and argues why one should go their own way!",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Someone asked me the other day, ‚ÄúIf you had to do it all over again, what would you do differently?‚Äù My only response was‚Äî‚ÄúAre you kidding me? There is no way I could get through it all again.‚Äù The last four years were, without a doubt, the best years of my life. But they were also the most difficult, challenging, complicated, and chaotic.",
      "I joined IITK Earth Science, intending to change to Physics after my first year. Within the first two days of orientation, it was made pretty clear to me that my branch was considered inferior. ‚ÄúSo you must want to change to CSE or EE?‚Äù Seniors would ask me jokingly, but the implication was obvious. Even after my first year, when I was applying to change to Physics, people constantly advised me to change to abetterbranch. Looking back, I‚Äôm just grateful I took a moment to think about what I really wanted, what kind of future I‚Äôd be happy with. I‚Äôm not going to tell you that everything will work out in the end, no matter what you choose. It might, it might not. But taking a moment to decide for yourself rather than following established trends is always a step in the right direction.",
      "When I joined, I was super excited to be a student at IITK. But I never got to be one; I was always afemalestudent. As a girl, everything you achieve is eitherbecauseyou‚Äôre a girl ordespiteit.Got that internship? It‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a girl. Good at coding? Even though she‚Äôs a girl??I spent so long wishing I could just be a person, but in a batch of 50 girls and 750 guys, that was never going to happen. Too often, I was the only girl in the room, in the branch, in the club. And when that happens, your voice is automatically subdued, and everything you do is scrutinised and discussed. If you find yourself in such a situation, you‚Äôre not alone. Talk to any girl around you and odds are, she‚Äôs been through something similar, and you can both get it off your chests (I promise it‚Äôs cathartic). What I got from this experience was thick skin, and the realisation that if people are always going to judge, I might as well be the most authentic version of myself. For a long time, being a girl at IITK was quite suffocating for me. But while it was a slow and frustrating process, I will say that learning to get over it was liberating.",
      "I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to know what I wanted from the beginning‚ÄîI wanted to do research in Physics, and I‚Äôve rarely ever doubted it. I did poorly on the JEE and didn‚Äôt get the branch of my choice. But one thing IITK gives you is a second chance (in terms of a branch change), and a third chance (in terms of a double major), and many more chances in terms of minors and various types of dual degrees so that you can pursue what you really want. After my branch change, I seized every opportunity to do research and never looked back. We often feel like our options are limited to what the people around us are doing, and we pick and choose our activities from that basket. One of the best decisions I made as an inexperienced first-year was to apply for research positions in fields I had no background in, and keep trying until I found a professor who would be willing to take me on. This led to some amazing experiences and projects, which only opened more doors in the future, and a big part of that was not being afraid of rejection. I fell in love with quantum mechanics and lasers at the labs I worked in. In my opinion, doing something you‚Äôre passionate about is the key to not being burnt out academically.",
      "The other half of my college life was music. I‚Äôve always loved singing, but as a fresher, I was terrified of performing. Ask anyone who saw my face on Freshers‚Äô Night- I was ready to pass out. But I sang, and the world didn‚Äôt end, and somehow three years later I gave my last performance as coordinator with (almost) no stage fright. All clubs at IITK are disorganised to some degree. If you join one, you‚Äôll probably have both good and bad experiences (and many sleepless nights). But if you‚Äôre lucky, and I was, you‚Äôll also find some of your best friends, some of the most talented people, and some of the coolest juniors to hangout and perform with.",
      "As I say goodbye to IITK, I take with me the best and the worst of it. I take with me the Antaragni pronite I missed because I was having an anxiety episode. And the very next night when I danced for three straight hours with my friends. The wing gossip sessions that made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt, as well as the inevitable 3am nervous breakdowns when I had two endsems the next day. The joy, the stress, the judgements, the missed classes, the eureka moments in the lab, the frustration of a project not working out. The day my internship offer was revoked, the day I got a PhD offer from my dream school. The professors who inspired me, the professors who felt too awkward talking to a girl and addressed me through my male batchmates. The MT pakodas that breathed life back into me after a night-out, the mess sambar that gave me food poisoning.",
      "There‚Äôs a lot more I could say about my journey at IITK, its ups and downs, but all I really want to say is‚Äîdon‚Äôt spend your time trying to imitate your seniors‚Äô or wingmates‚Äô paths. When I joined four years ago, a lot of the beloved ‚ÄòIITK culture‚Äô was about uniformity. A uniform way to introduce yourself, to behave as a first-year, tointeractwith the seniors. A fixed hierarchy of branches, an established set of activities you were expected to participate in. For me, nothing has been cooler than watching that change. So here‚Äôs to a new IITK culture‚Äîone where the power lies with you; one that‚Äôs about being yourself, finding your people, and defining your life on your own terms.",

      "Jay Gupta is a Y17 undergraduate student from the Department of Economics.  He talks about the choices he made during his journey and how his undergraduate days shaped his career.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "When I sat down to write my ‚ÄòAs we leave‚Äô, I wanted to start with a quote that could summarise me. However, I couldn‚Äôt go through with it because I realised I was a different Jay Gupta every semester. I believe this happens because everything around you, what you choose to do and its outcome, leaves its imprint on you. For instance, almost nobody knows this, but from classes 5-9, I faced continuous verbal harassment from my friends, which made me really pessimistic towards life. But within the first two months of coming to IITK, I realised I was at a place where I could do whatever I wanted to, which gave me a really positive approach towards life. This place had the kind of potential that could make Michael Scott‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúYou have no idea how high I can fly‚Äù, come true. But, unfortunately, COVID put a stopper to our journey sooner than usual.",
      "The only difference was that we were unaware our entire year was going to get washed away the last time. So, this time, I went back to campus and made sure to relive all the memories ‚Äî¬† the ground reportings, photography sessions, discussions, movie nights, parties; to put the crux of my time spent in a nutshell to take away with me.",
      "‚Äú‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á, ‡§Æ‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§¨ ‡§§‡§ï ‡§â‡§°‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§§‡§¨ ‡§§‡§ï ‡§§‡•ã ‡§∂‡•å‡§ï ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§°‡•á‡§Ç!‚Äù",

      "And I followed it sacredly for the first two years! I tried everything that was possible and seemed interesting. My interests were like rolling stones, which didn‚Äôt want to settle! I started with Aeromodelling, which changed into a passion for Robotics when we won the 3rd position in Takneek, which changed to entrepreneurship and then to Management. I realised that engaging yourself in different activities is not only the most fun part about staying on campus, but it actually helps you decide what kind of career you want to pursue.",
      "Unfortunately, our campus community has a problem of following seniors blindly. People tend to choose their goals based on what they have just heard from these seniors and then do everything to achieve them without engraving their own path. But I firmly believe one should always explore things on their own first, and only then choose to do something!",
      "At the end of my 1st year, like everyone else, I thought I knew a lot about the Department of¬† Economics at IITK and started giving excessive advice on counselling forums. Now when I think about this, it was ridiculous! When someone enters IITK, all they think about are placements, packages, etc. I did too. But believe me, getting a job is the smallest thing that I am taking away from IITK. The most important thing that IITK teaches you is ‚Äòthe process of learning!‚Äô.",
      "Perhaps this is why I don‚Äôt get why people in core branches crib so much about poor placement/internship opportunities because belonging to a core branch makes you strong enough to learn everything on your own! I appreciate core branches so much that I regret not to have explored core fields like Robotics and only things pertinent to my branch. Of course, Economics is not an easy, unworthy subject. Still, it‚Äôs sad that many people from our department spend their four years without doing much hard work and miss out on learning the temperament required to achieve a bigger output. But let‚Äôs not forget,",
      "‚ÄúIf 1 is your output from academics, then each extra 0 ahead of it comes from your extracurriculars‚Äù",
      "During my 2nd year, I had multiple PORs, from Students‚Äô Opinion Society Secretary, E-Cell Senior Executive, SPO Company Coordinator, to Techkriti Manager. But for my 3rd year, I chose to stick with SOS, which then was just at its inception. I enjoyed the work and my association at SOS the most and am grateful that I became a part of its journey ‚Äî from a hobby group to a club! This feeling of happiness that comes with being a part of someone else‚Äôs success is by far the best feeling one can have, and IIT Kanpur has been the best place for me to realise this.",
      "‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§á‡§∂‡•ç‡§ï‡§º ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ,",

      "Though I wanted the 3rd line to be true, the 4th one ended up standing closer to the truth.",
      "At the end of my 3rd semester, I had engaged myself in multiple research projects. I think my wing‚Äôs environment itself motivated me to explore research. So much so, I ended up doing SURGE during the summers with nearly all my wingies! I was also fortunate enough to have found the perfect work partner. We didn‚Äôt know anyone who had actively worked in financial research, so we went to one of the most humble professors (a friend/mentor out of the faculty), and fortunately, he accepted us for one of his long-term projects. We even ended up studying some PhD level courses on our own to understand tens of research papers! Things were difficult to manage then, but working on two research projects was the best part of my professional life. And though my sleep cycle ended up turning into a joke, my wingies, thankfully, made that enjoyable too.",
      "‡§á‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§´‡§º‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§ê‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•ã ‡§ó‡§à",

      "I soon realized, while walking around Hall 12 at night, discussing projects, bugs in code, conceptual issues with my friend, research could never tire me. Research is that form entrepreneurship where you need to drive the project with your persistence, passion and energy; where you are not answerable to anyone, but yourself. I ended up getting rewarded too when my papers got accepted at various conferences, including IEEE!",
      "‚ÄúWithout them, every achievement is incomplete, and with them, any failure is a success.‚Äù",
      "My favourite senior once told me, ‚ÄúYou are merely the average of the five people you are most attached to‚Äù, and I think that‚Äôs very true!",
      "My relationship with my friends was a roller coaster ride! It started with D506, moving on to E511, and lastly, to E606. These were not only my rooms but the wing‚Äôs headquarters. Behind these walls, I made some of my fondest memories. From getting the responsibility of bringing everyone together to planning three remarkably optimised trips, I met some bakchod people who, further down the line, I connected with on an emotional level. These people became my mentors, wisest counsellors, human diaries, and my strongest critics. Listening to them, discussing, planning and executing even the smallest things with them was ‚Äòlub‚Äô (Munna bhaiya wala lub).",
      "However, the intern season was the time I realised these guys were my oxygen cylinders. I still remember, a day before my Credit Suisse interview, one of my friends simply hung out in my room to help alleviate anxiety and make me feel comfortable. My favourite senior came to my room at two in the night to take a mock interview, and a friend even threatened not to talk to me if I failed to crack the interview! Another friend could detect my nervousness simply over a phone call, and one of them even came to my interview location, just to give me company!",
      "In my opinion, it indeed was the best feeling to have seen people be happier about your successes than you yourself. Now, though we‚Äôre all about to go our separate ways, we know we‚Äôll be there for each other, unfailingly.",
      "Someone said this correctly, ‚ÄúYou are the most vulnerable when you are the most comfortable‚Äù.",
      "When things in life seemed as though they were sorted, a series of events transpired at the end of my fifth semester, which pushed me back to my dark-old days. I kept questioning myself, had gigantic expectations from others, all the while spreading negativity to everyone close to me. I was constantly irritated and kept pushing people away. Should I call it depression or just an ill-experienced phase of life? I don‚Äôt know. But today, I know I will always find someone at IITK who will listen to all of my sorrow-filled depressing thoughts, to my whining and crumbling-downs, without complaining.",
      "Now, as I leave, I have realised that I am the only one who truly knows what kind of life I want to live; to not be driven unknowingly by people around me, even if I have to live alone. A balance must exist between how much you care about other people, and what will be necessary for your personal satiation. (Lol, zyada ho gaya. xD)",
      "Nevertheless, during my journey on campus, I was fortunate enough to have gotten the best hall (Hall 12), the perfect PORs, some remarkable professors, professionally stable partners with lots of connections, the smartest roommate, the most dependable people you could do courses with (that‚Äôs why I passed my OEs xD), the best possible senior-cum-mentor, and pals who empathised, inspired and helped me get the best out of myself. At times, I was so afraid of losing these people that, I ended up not taking the full advantage of all of the opportunities that had been offered to me. Nonetheless, this part of my life at IITK was genuine happiness. I am not sad that my journey at IITK is over, because it was the best thing that ever happened to me!",
      "I suppose one of my professors did say it right, ‚ÄúIIT Kanpur is IIT Kanpur not because of the professors, facilities, or infrastructure. It is IIT Kanpur because it has IITians like us. So, believe in yourself, and enjoy!‚Äù",

I am graduating from the department of Mechanical Engineering this year. (Disclaimer : If you are here for some gyaan about Mechanical Engineering or intern or placement or life, just scroll down to the last section of this article)",
      "According to me, I am a Clich√©. An engineering graduate interested in writing stories (not books) & everything except academics. But when I told this to my best friend from IITK (Let‚Äôs call him Abhay Varshney), he said that I am not a clich√© & I have done some stupid stuff during my college life, that ‚Äúsounds‚Äù interesting.",
      "College life is like your favourite playlist. You keep adding new songs & you skip the songs that you don‚Äôt like anymore ‚Äì but you are also lazy enough to not remove them from the same playlist.",
      "Coming from a Gujarati medium background, I was always told that the first six months of college would be the hardest ones. And I believed that. Orientation was fun, I remember myself enjoying the campus tours, dancing on the stage to some stupid songs & taking some witty photos with my wingies. During that time, I found a guy hailing from my city. I remember enjoying the cycle rides, study sessions & the exploration tours of Delhi while travelling home after missing flights. I still remember roaming around the campus of IITD with him in Sept 2017.",
      "It was around 15th Sept 2017 when I talked to Anjali ma‚Äôam from the PE section about handball. It is basically a game which is there in Udghosh but no coach or facilities are available for that at IIT Kanpur. (Irony!) She along with Sunil sir (Football coach) arranged a centuries-old ball & a football ground, where I trained around 10-15 seniors on how to play handball & what are the techniques for that & we made the first Handball team of IIT Kanpur. (Confidence dekh rahe ho lounde ka XD)",
      "Tragedy aana abhi baaki hai mere dost! It was 2nd October 2017 ‚Äì Garba night on which I got my hand fractured & had to return home for surgery in the middle of the semester. Couldn‚Äôt participate in Udghosh & missed my first college fest (& free pizzas :P) I had to restrict my movements & those 2 months with a plaster in hand actually helped me make a lot of acquaintances, especially in my wing. (obviously, I was the center of attraction with some witty stuff written on the plaster)",
      "Galaxy practice for nukkad naatak, which started in January was fun to an extent after which it was literally kind of a physical & mental torture for me (in the name of ‚Äì enthu) & I gave up practicing 3 days before the main competition. (Without regrets)",
      "With all of this, I was exploring my love for writing, poetry & storytelling. In March 2018, I organised an open mic at Urban Crave (campus cafe) which was a success honestly. All these started to create a sort of ego in me which I was clearly able to see when I went to give interviews of 2-3 clubs of my liking. (HSS, Films & E-cell ‚Äì & almost got rejected in 2 of them!) Also, it started reflecting my careless attitude.",
      "Amidst all this, I was selected for the Lawn tennis summer camp team (I still can‚Äôt believe that) & those 35 days of grilling helped me a lot in making some new friends & I thoroughly enjoyed the free food that we got as a part of the camp. I decided that I won‚Äôt continue Tennis after the camp because it required a ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù of at least 2-3 hours of my after-class time which I was not ready for. That camp was more or less my last formal encounter with any kind of sport.",
      "Frankly speaking, I don‚Äôt remember much about my 2nd year except that ‚Äì this year, we actually participated in Udghosh (stood last :|), bunked mechanical core classes for sleeping & did some work here & there for clubs. The 3rd semester wasn‚Äôt quite good for me. I got 6 SPI in 2nd semester (Thanks to Galaxy [Seniors shouting in the background ‚Äì ‚ÄúCourse nahi sambhal sakte to job kya sambhaloge aage!‚Äù]), couldn‚Äôt write a single line of poetry for almost 6 months & 24*7 pressure to perform better in quizzes & exams. Maybe the two good things that happened to me in my 2nd year were ‚Äì finding best friends in my wing itself & organising TEDxIITK with the E-Cell team. This was the year when I came to the conclusion that Mechanical Engineering is not something that I want to do in my life (frankly because I suck at it). But I was not even ready with an answer to ‚Äúif not this, then what?‚Äù. I decided to skip an internship offer from an IITK startup to focus on the work that I have to do as the manager of MnP at E-Cell & took 2 summer courses in parallel. That was one of the best decisions that I made in my 2nd year. (Thanks to Saksham Gupta for the manipulation xD).",
      "Those 2 months were all about studying with Abhay, Bahubali & Aditya for summer courses (Lol no! For Lib AC) & lying on bean bags in IME312 while working our asses off for the E-Summit 2019. Those chai & bulla sessions at DOAA canteen with Saksham(x2), Sharma, Jangid, Vikram & all the teammates used to be the best highlights of those days.",

      "3rd year at IIT Kanpur was all about being stronger philosophically & learning about startups, humans, every kind of relationship, life & most importantly ‚Äì about myself. As expected, E-Summit was a blast. Most of the arrangements that we did became successful. We noticed those bright, shining & hopeful eyes of attendees & juniors students of IITK getting wider & happier during those days (Being the former head of media & publicity, yeh bolna zaruri hai XD). While partying at VH & Liquid (restaurant) after completion of E-Summit, I didn‚Äôt realise that those were the only few good moments that were gonna take place in 2019. On the very next day of E-Summit‚Äô19, IME312 was taken away from the E-Cell team FOREVER by the college administration. We all cried as if a toy had been taken away from a small child. IME312 was our happy place üôÅ",
      "My sister always tells me that I inspire her through my ‚Äúchill‚Äù attitude. I was someone who didn‚Äôt take internship season seriously. (Karke kya hi mil jayega was my escape. But deep down I knew that I was still not good enough for any company) I remember the days when I used to go for an intern test & used to come out of the NCL immediately seeing the coding questions in the test. Intern test of a startup named ZestMoney was scheduled at 12:00 midnight on the night of Antaragni & I was discussing with Jay, Bhavesh & Dheeraj if we can miss the test & write an apology mail later. But Jay forced me to go for the test. It was a case study & went pretty well. And the next day, I got a call saying I was selected as an intern there. (Without even an interview!) (Jaa! Kya jhoot bol raha hai ‚Äì was the reaction from my friends when I told them that ‚Äì Intern lag gayi XD)",
      "I have read somewhere that 3rd year is the most difficult year for any engineering student. You enter your 20s, you are confused about your career, you can clearly see your grades going down & what not. I will always remember November 2019 in my entire life. One day, I came back to my room after trying to study some MechEngi course with Abhay. It was around 4 AM in the morning & we both started crying in my room. LIKE HELL. That was our situation & it wasn‚Äôt just because of acads. It was an amalgamation of stress, emotions & relationship crisis! I scored 4.29 SPI in that semester. (Thanks to some mechanical engineering professors who passed me in their respective courses even after scoring less than 30%) I always loved December breaks more than Summer ones because they give me time to recover & don‚Äôt burden me with questions like ‚Äì ‚ÄúKaise utilise karna hai yeh time?‚Äù Winter ‚Äô19 break was like the biggest relief that I have ever got. I started recovering from January 2020 without any external help. 3 months went by, test scores were very low as always & then COVID-19 lockdown happened & we all passed the semester without any examination. (The only reason because of which I am graduating this year)",
      "17th May 2021, 11:38 PM",
      "My internship went pretty well. The learning there & IITK tag helped me to crack 2 other internships. (with an early stage startup & a VC fund) Till then, I had become a bit consistent with my story-poetry writing & could see it improving from the reactions of my followers on Instagram. I decided that I won‚Äôt be sitting for placements & will join some media & content company. When my friends were preparing for placements ‚Äì I was putting in efforts to find some intern roles at these media companies, which were all in vain. It was November 10th when I decided that I will at least give a try to placements(Peer pressure & expectations). I had my internships in product teams & was giving placement tests for that kind of role. I started preparing for interviews around 15th November. (without even a single shortlisting till then) It was 26th November when I decided to step back (fear of rejection striked again) & called Abhay for guidance. With his motivation, I continued my process & got shortlisted for 1 interview on Day-1 (got only 2 shortlistings for first 3 days of placements) & luckily/unluckily converted that to a full-time offer. Unluckily because it wasn‚Äôt the role that I wanted to pursue & luckily because the interviewer selected me even after telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt work at that company if I want a startup experience.",
      "During all these events, I realised that just a selection mail for an intern/job won‚Äôt give you the kind of happiness that you need & ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù. Only the work that you do for yourself, for your own likings can bring that big beautiful smile to your face. I started a small community for artists in January 2021 named Mic Drop Community, which has grown to 120+ artists right now. Two of the most important things that are making my current mental, physical & professional states better are this community & the friends at IIT Kanpur. Oh! How can I not mention the 30 days I spent at IITK from March 22nd to April 22nd. Those nightwalks, bakchodi, mess food, bulla sessions, isolation periods & all those stupid wingies. (I am crying or you are crying?) I can write about the emotions during those 30 days. But let‚Äôs not dive deep into that for now. I don‚Äôt want to make you all feel jealous üôÅ",
      "22nd May 2021, 10:20 PM",
      "Just before starting to write this article on 15th May, I rejected the placement offer from Flipkart without a confirmed job in hand at that time. Last 4 months of 2021 taught me a lot about happiness, hobbies, passion, art & what not. I was not able to connect myself to Flipkart or any other corporate giants. I applied for some seed & series-A startups which are working in the sector that I love & I just received an offer from a company that aligns with my interests. (which are media, creation & communities) If you are still reading, you might have noticed that I gave up on most of the things in my college life (including hard work, relationships, friends, jobs, and even myself sometimes). I don‚Äôt believe in long term goals & don‚Äôt know what I will be doing after 2, 3 or 5 years. During my entire college life, I have been a very unorganised human being. But when I look back now, giving up on some things & ‚Äútrends‚Äù made me push my limits & become a better human. Maybe?",
      "The Mic Drop Community will continue to grow with the job. But I am sure that Mic Drop Community & my friends (Fam!) are going to be the only things that I won‚Äôt ever think about giving up on, from IITK. I know it sounds clich√©. But I warned you at the very start itself ‚Äì I am a clich√©!",
      "23rd May 2021, 07:25 PM",
      "Lastly, have fun! Click a lot of photographs. (screenshots in the current batches‚Äô case LOL) & Go for trips if possible! These years are called the golden year of your life for a reason. Stay safe. Khush raho üôÇ",

      "Avik Pal is a Y17 undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He presents his trajectory through 4 years of IITK.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Writing with a creative writing style is kind of not my thing. The only things I have written lately are technical reports, and they tend not to be very ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù So, the obvious thing to do was to go through previous AWL posts and interpolate between the narrative styles (or, as my friends call it, ‚Äúyaha pe bhi machine learning apply karna‚Äù). Unfortunately, I realized these AWLs have the common theme of ‚Äúroller coaster‚Äù rides and people facing an ‚Äúexistential crisis‚Äù of research vs. jobs (as if one summer decides your entire life trajectory). Before you call me an asshole for trivializing these grave existential problems, let me clarify that I don‚Äôt have any beef with these stories. In a free world, everyone should get to share their stories. However, I think it paints an overly biased notion that having stuff sorted out is uncommon and bad since you are not ‚Äúexploring‚Äù (whatever that means), and being confused in the new (and better?) normal.",
      "In contrast, my experiences (fortunately/unfortunately?) have mostly been a trajectory with positive gradients with respect to time, despite not ‚Äúexploring‚Äù much. IITK is a fantastic place. But here, I will highlight some shit stuff you will most likely see and experience around you to emphasize that even in the best of places, you will find such terrible commonplace notions. And that it is crucial to not let them affect or control you in any sense.",
      "Having said that, it might be worthwhile to mention that I was someone who entered IITK with my major being Aerospace Engineering. This was one of the worst decisions I could have taken, not because of the particular major or job prospects as ‚Äúwise‚Äù seniors would point out, but because I wanted to study AI (yeah, from even before starting college), which is totally unrelated to AE. And I knew it would affect my chances for good graduate schools (yup started planning from back then!). Nevertheless, I did manage to change my major to CSE, and things worked out. The point is I wanted to study AI even before I entered college and will continue to work in AI for my Ph.D. This has nothing to do with not ‚Äúexploring.‚Äù I knew I liked computer science in general and tried the various avenues it offered. Still, nothing else seemed to click for me. This notion of not exploring is extremely stupid; think about not sticking with something amazing, aka having commitment issues. It also implicitly leads to this belief that the first thing you like is suboptimal. Just to reiterate, it is okay to know what you want to do, as it is fine not knowing what to do. If you are having fun doing something, keep doing it, don‚Äôt be pressured to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù every random opportunity that comes your way.",
      "Okay, now, coming to my first year, the most ridiculous time would definitely be the ones spent with the HEC. We were told that freshers are not ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù to have laptops (Y18s and beyond, be thankful you didn‚Äôt face this stupidity) so that they can socialize with their peer group. Having laptops in a technical college is supposedly harmful while spending countless hours in meaningless events like Galaxy and Takneek will help you get jobs by playing drums (ask a Y17 Hall 5 folk if you want to know the story). I distinctly remember being told how seniors will not help us in the future if we did not participate in these GC events. I did not participate in a single event in my freshman year simply because those events had nothing to do with what I wanted to do ( although I happened to participate in my second year only because a friend of mine took up the position of Hall Captain :facepalm:). And it turns out several seniors have helped me out over the years. Most folks at IITK are helpful. And if someone asks, ‚Äúdid you participate in GC?‚Äù when you go to them for some guidance, you‚Äôd probably want to steer clear from them (they have serious issues with priorities in life to give advice to others). As I said earlier, these random opportunities to showcase your ‚Äúhidden‚Äù talents will keep popping up but remember, time is limited and it is often better to pass them if they don‚Äôt align with your long-term priorities.",
      "Now let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room. Or maybe the ant which the students have made to seem like an elephant, aka PoRs. I won‚Äôt take the higher moral ground and deny being involved in obtaining PoRs. I applied and became an SG and AM, probably because all my friends were applying for the same. I probably should have known better, but I was a stupid 18-year-old. Though in hindsight, I did meet some of my closest friends there. I was also involved in some club activities, but honestly, my time would have been spent better elsewhere. Being engaged in PoRs for fun is great but treating them as something more than that is outright foolish. It is like the people who claim that playing video games improves their reflexes and whatnot. Even I play many of these games, but I do it for fun; those short dopamine bursts are amazing, and that‚Äôs it. So to summarize, if you have space to fit PoRs in your resume, you are already at a disadvantage.",
      "Ah, the third year. The year which decides if you will win a Turing Award or create the next Apple (or maybe just work there, not sure what is the most prestigious thing in corporate jobs). Just kidding, don‚Äôt stress too much about what you are going to do in the summers. It probably won‚Äôt matter much in the long term. If you are certain about what you want, just go do that, don‚Äôt listen to your friend or senior who tries to explain how X is the new fad, and you need to do that. 3 months is generally too short a time to have a lasting impact on what you want to do in life. The stress induced by the desire to solve the mental dilemma of research vs job is just not worth it.",
      "Coming to jobs, based on the recommendation of a friend, I decided to check out the apparently relatable series ‚ÄúAlma Matters.‚Äù Halfway through the 2nd episode, I was unsure if I was supposed to feel bad for the folks or if it was a sarcastic comedy. They were proudly saying that they don‚Äôt go to classes and used to just fool around not acquiring technical skills and were later cribbing that it is hard to get a technical job. I do hope it was sarcasm. But sadly, I have seen such folks here at IITK as well. I am not talking about folks who put in a lot of effort; I empathize with them and sincerely hope they get the position they want. I am talking about the people who don‚Äôt put in an ounce of effort and crib how the SPO screwed them over. I don‚Äôt have any experience with SPO, but I have received both academic and industrial offers through cold emailing and job portals. I guess being a typical maggu who locks himself in his room paid off (and quite well, actually). If you don‚Äôt want a traditional job or go to graduate school, that is fine; enjoying what you do is far more important. To the others, stop living in denial and diverting blame to others; you are not entitled to a job simply because you are from IITK.",
      "Huh‚Ä¶ For the last year, I don‚Äôt quite remember any such incident ‚Äì perhaps you just get used to it and develop a great mechanism to filter those out. 4th year is supposed to be the time when most of your friends are placed, admitted to grad school, or have some sort of a plan for the future, and you are supposed to enjoy the last year on campus. But sadly, Covid cut down our 8 months to a mere 45 days. I did go back to campus for those few days, and honestly, I don‚Äôt have a logical reason to explain my decision. It was probably nostalgia and the desire to meet my friends for the last time (hopefully not). I had never thought I would miss IITK, but the day the email came to vacate the campus (and probably a few days before that at OAT), it did suck bad. So before moving on to the conclusion, let me say that keep doing what you enjoy and make few but good friends while you are here. Don‚Äôt let the expectations of the folks around you influence what you enjoy; after all, that is what the IITK bubble should be doing better than the outside society.",
      "Contrary to what you might think after reading this, I have had a fantastic time at IITK, and retrospectively the terrible decision turned out to be a great one. I have made some amazing friends and have spent several cherishable moments with them. And it has been an absolute privilege to have grown out of the teenage child that I was, with the absolutely amazing folks at IITK. Before concluding, I was supposed to think about something to tell myself if I were to start the journey all over again. Ignoring that it is impossible, who the hell wants to turn back into the stupid child, they were when they entered college. Regardless, I don‚Äôt think I would tell myself anything. I do have plenty of regrets about things I could have done, but perhaps I would not end up where I am today if I did those things. I am graduating with a great academic record, an amazing Ph.D. offer, a few great friends, and a plethora of good memories, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it otherwise.",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "",
      "This story is my journey of 4 years from a shy, introverted, underconfident and naive girl to a socially functional, somewhat confident and not-so-naive woman. Full of hiccups, awkward moments, laughter, heartbreaks and a whole lot of lessons, I hope this story gives you a fair idea of what to expect from IITK and lets you know that whatever path you chose, whatever roadblocks you face along the way, in the end, it will all work out for the best.",
      "June 11, 2017, the day JEE Advanced results were announced. I was sitting with 2 laptops and 3 mobile phones, all trying to open the same site. Finally, the result came on the screen, and I was stunned with disappointment. Eventually, the disappointment faded, and I got busy with college preparation. Between filling 200 choices (yes 200!) on the JoSAA portal and saying final goodbyes to friends (no crying was involved then, unlike the April 2021 goodbyes :(( ), time went on.",
      "On July 21, 2017, a rainy day, I entered IITK for the first time. On seeing the words ‚ÄúIndian Institute of Technology, Kanpur‚Äù in golden letters on the red brick wall, I suddenly felt an outburst of emotions. You know, it was hitting me for the first time that I had done it! All the hard work of 4 years, the long hours and sleepless nights had yielded this. And I hadn‚Äôt even taken a moment to process it, be happy about it or feel proud of myself. As it turns out, this will be the case for most of my journey of 4 years until I learnt better.",
      "The first semester was pretty typical and low-key for me. I took up wall painting for Freshers and didn‚Äôt seriously think about joining any club. I was under the impression that devoting almost 100% of my time to studies would lead to a branch change (I‚Äôm so thankful that it didn‚Äôt happen for so many reasons). Results of mid-semester exams soon demonstrated that it was the wrong approach because I was making myself miserable. Studying all the time wasn‚Äôt helping my grades at all. I joined Prayas after that, and it proved to be a silver lining in that semester. I was excited about my CPA swimming, though, and I loved the time I got to be in the pool. After the end of the first semester, there was little hope that I‚Äôd be able to change my branch. The second semester was tough, and it took some time to come to terms with that fact. At the end of it, a senior gave me some advice that helped me a lot in the remainder of my academic journey.",
      "In the summer of my first year, I altered how I was approaching campus life. I started going out of my room, talking to new people (which was paralysing for me), and having a little more fun. I participated in the Summer of Code, organised by the CSE department and took a project under Dr Nisheeth Srivastava related to Cognitive Sciences (which regretfully went unfinished). I was an SG and the orientation week was an eye-opener for me; we used to be so exhausted at the end of every day, but it was so much fun. I started studying in the library and having group study sessions, which, apparently, worked well for me.",
      "Consequently, things were beginning to go in a positive direction academically. I had also joined Raktarpan by then, which made many of my weekends exhausting. Still, the satisfaction at the end of the day knowing it was all for a noble cause made it all worth it.",
      "Overall, the third semester was a roller coaster with academic highs and personal lows. I still had no idea about the bigger picture, about what I wanted for my career. These were some of the constant questions haunting my mind in the fourth semester while I struggled with ESC201 and PSO201. Coding wasn‚Äôt appealing to me even at that time. Moreover, I hadn‚Äôt explored my branch yet. This was because, one, I had already dismissed that train of thought. Two, I hadn‚Äôt encountered an apt channel for doing that until a friend came up with the idea of doing a UGP together the following summer. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I could have taken then, not because it pushed me towards my branch but because it made it clear that neither the field nor the research path was meant for me!",
      "During the UGP under Dr Gurao, I was preparing myself for the upcoming internship season. However, since many of my friends were able to secure an internship for second year summers and I couldn‚Äôt, staying motivated wasn‚Äôt easy. But thanks to a few friends, I held my head high and kept at it.",
      "The week before the first internship interview is when you have back-to-back tests for the Day 1 and Day 2 companies. Unfortunately, that was the week I had a 101-degree fever. I gave the tests thinking I won‚Äôt get shortlisted anywhere. Still, thankfully I got shortlisted for 3 companies on Day 1 and 2 companies on Day 2. Day 1 interviews started poorly since I hadn‚Äôt slept well the previous night. Slowly I started getting into the groove and gave the remaining two interviews, which went well, in my opinion. Sadly I didn‚Äôt get in. That night was one of the most challenging nights in my campus life. Also, due to the fever and speaking for an extended period, my throat started closing up, and I couldn‚Äôt sleep till 4am. All this amounted to increasing my nervousness for the next day. I talked to a senior at that time. He hyped me up about the next day and made me optimistic about the coming two interviews. So, I went ahead with the Group Discussion for the first one. Having some of my closest friends around me that day in the Tutorial block helped me with the nerves. Then the interview for American Express started, and I thought I messed up the first round. But as it turned out, I was misjudging the situation due to my closed up throat and toad-like voice :p. The next round went well, and the final round was even better. I, along with a friend, was walking back to our hall when we were called back to the LHC. We were both offered the internship! Whenever people ask me about my most cherished moments on campus, this moment is my top choice.",
      "I was selected as the Overall Coordinator of the Community Welfare Cell at the end of my fourth semester. So, after the internship drive, I focused on the Community Welfare Cell wholeheartedly. Working in CWC has been one of my most confusing experiences. One moment it was gratifying, satisfying, challenging and exciting. But the very next moment, it drove me crazy, mainly because I was handling the responsibility single-handedly. That being said, I did have a lot of positive experiences and learnings from CWC.¬† Speaking in front of the whole auditorium in Orientation 2019 and ideating and executing an entirely new campaign for Organ Donation Awareness gave me a much-needed self-confidence boost. The self-confidence that I had lacked right from the start of my campus journey. Managing the conflicts in the team taught me a lot about leadership, team-building and patience. I dealt with insensitive seniors while I was sick and still pulled through by completing all my duties without a hitch. This experience taught me that there will always be people who want to bring you down. There will always be inconveniences in your life, but what matters most is your dedication to your duty and the cause you believe in.",
      "Coming to the final chapter of this story, which sadly took place at our homes. This phase was something none of us had expected to go through: being at home for a year, working from home for internships and preparing and sitting for placements from home itself. All of it had its pros and cons, which I think we all know and have analysed in great depth already. However, I unexpectedly came closer to my extended family during this time. Game nights and weekly video calls became the new normal. I found out I liked baking cakes, apart from eating them too, hehe.",
      "After completing the internship in July, I started preparing for Consulting placements. For a month, I laboured over my resume, making iterations over iterations of it, practising cases with a few friends and some seniors. That paid off when I was shortlisted for two out of the three firms. Eventually, I was rejected by both of them. Now, I was behind schedule preparing for the SPO placements, and the PPO results from AmEx hadn‚Äôt been announced until then. Hence, I was very clueless and anxious. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt have to wait too long for the PPO results. One of the pros of being at home at that time was being able to see the happiness and pride on my parents‚Äô faces. On hearing the news, my friends woke me up at 2 am and insisted on having a video call then and there xD.",
      "Now that the serious business was out of the way, we planned a trip to Goa! The trip was terrific, the seemingly perfect end to the 4 years.",
      "Until we got to know that we‚Äôd be able to come back to campus for a while! I count visiting campus for the last 1.5 months as a blessing which Y17 was so fortunate to get.",
      "Meeting so many friends again,being in unimaginable situations,having all the coveted photoshoots, exploring campus alone at night and having those fun bulla sessions in wings again (@my wingmates, as I write this, Levitating is playing :P) was the perfect way to relive all the best parts of our 4 years. During the past 1.5 months, our wing spent a lot of time together playing games, exchanging stories which we earlier hadn‚Äôt. In these discussions, the issue of the rampant sexist behaviour in the campus community came up. As we shared our stories, we realised that all of us had been through sexist incidents (though with varying degrees of seriousness) in some manner in our 4 years.",
      "The casual commentators forget how damaging it can be to a young woman‚Äôs psyche and self-esteem on hearing that she isn‚Äôt fit for that random PoR in the Gymkhana, about how she didn‚Äôt deserve to get that internship or win that competition, how her ‚Äòbehaviour‚Äô isn‚Äôt compliant enough for the club or group to function, how someone‚Äôs reasonable expectations from a group of human beings were termed as ‚Äòdrama‚Äô, how she is easily offended by ‚Äòjokes‚Äô which arejustjokes apparently. And these are just the instances of casual sexism we had encountered; the more serious ones were plain disgusting.",
      "It‚Äôs convenient for us to ignore the problems in front of us, but is that what the ‚Äúcream of the nation‚Äù is supposed to be doing, ignoring the wrongs staring right at us? It‚Äôs uncomfortable calling out on your friends‚Äô problematic behaviours, but isn‚Äôt that what friendships really are, making each other a better person? Ask these questions to yourself the next time you reluctantly snicker at a friend‚Äôs sexist joke.",
      "Nevertheless, IITK has given me so many memories, experiences, lessons and amazing people that can‚Äôt be captured in a piece of writing. I still wish that we had till the end of the last semester to stay on campus. But that‚Äôs just it; any extension period would feel inadequate; it‚Äôs that amazing a place! Saying goodbye to it wasn‚Äôt easy, but I‚Äôm so thankful that I could do it in person. I had no idea that just hearing some lines of a song, watching a friend from afar in the pharmacy or seeing the no dues slip from the hall office could make me break down and bawl like a 2-year-old. As I drove out of the campus, all I wanted was to soak it all in one last time, the people, the buildings, the laughter, the tears and the 4 years.",
      "That was IITK for me. This was my story; some parts might be relatable for you, and some parts might not be. I hope you take the best possible insights out of them. As I write this, I am perfectly content with how everything turned out. I am glad I chose this place and that this place chose me too. IITK ka tempo high hai <3",

      "When I stepped onto the campus, I was an introvert but still got lucky enough to make lifelong friends in the first few weeks itself.

      "During my first year, though I didn‚Äôt know many people, I wanted to contest for the senate elections and hit a try. I knew there were high chances of losing, but I also knew that I would regret it if I¬† don‚Äôt give it a try. I worked hard on my manifesto but still had an instilled fear of presenting it in front of a big unknown crowd. My wingies, especially Pranav and Manish, helped me prepare and had more confidence than I could ever have in myself. Finally, the results were out, and I was elected.",
      "The second-year was the happiest year of my life as everything worked out the way I had expected. The sun always shone, and there were no worries. I was performing well in academics and enjoyed college at my best. Sleepless nights during¬† Antaragni is something that I will always cherish. I met and conversed with new people playing dumb charades, singing, dancing etc. My friends and I successfully went on a trip to Goa (without cancelling the plan this time xD), and my brother joined us too. I had also managed to get an internship in the second year as I was very excited to work for a company and gain some corporate experience. Moreover, I was on cloud nine for being in a relationship for the first time in my life.",
      "A wise man once said, ‚ÄúLife is best lived and enjoyed if the odds of life are faced boldly and fearlessly‚Äù, and little did I know that I would have to learn that lesson quicker than I could fathom.",
      "The third-year was the most challenging year that I had to go through. I got overstressed on trivial things when things weren‚Äôt smooth. The year started with spo internship season as I had prepared a lot for it. My relationship ended roughly. I felt very lonely during the time, blaming rough patches in life for being so harsh on me. Further, I was overburdened with pressure and nervousness when I couldn‚Äôt get any internship offer in the first two days: abroken relationship and the perpetual menace of ‚Äú log kya kahenge‚Äù caught up with me.I¬† got depressed, and my health started deteriorating. I had trouble sleeping and also had a panic attack on campus. My family was worried about me. I decided to approach a counsellor who helped me understand my feelings. I won‚Äôt be doing justice if I don‚Äôt thank my friends Atharv Tyagi and Himanshu Gupta enough, who helped me immensely, and Mudreka Arif helped me a lot in academics. My anger issues escalated, and I mainly started avoiding people. As they say, everything heals with time, so it did in my case. Eventually and gradually, everything got healed, and at the end of the day, it all made me stronger.",
      "I managed to get a good internship opportunity and got happy about it, but I was informed that it was cancelled as I was about to join my internship. All my friends joined good companies while I failed to do anything productive that summer. It was quite a saddening episode for me. But life moves on, and so do we.",
      "I didn‚Äôt want to face placement pressure at the time, so I converted my degree to a dual program (though I didn‚Äôt want to do it) and secured an internship in a company that I wanted. I was pretty confident of landing an excellent off-campus full-time offer and dropping my dual degree program. So, initially, I went on with my plan.",
      "I started applying off-campus and was able to get two very good job offers (better than I thought I could muster). My senior, Himanshu Gupta, helped me a lot during the process by motivating me in my lows, helping me prepare and connecting me with all his friends in good companies.",
      "Since then, my life has been a lot happier. I feel more confident in life than ever. I owe a lot to Himanshu and Pranav, who constantly stood by me.",
      "IIT Kanpur always helped me explore my inner self further, and now I know that,",
      "to me, staying happy was never about being successful, getting the perfect job or having an excellent ideal relationship but following my heart, exploring new things, and prioritising taking care of myself over anything else.",
      "My advice to anyone out there would be academics is important but not as much as sacrificing your college life for fun. One should always maintain a healthy balance between fun and academics. No matter how challenging the circumstances are, it‚Äôs always important to know that the hardships are only a part of the game (JEE taught us that). We need to believe in ourselves and a few fools like us that we find in this journey and cherish as friends to come out of these hardships stronger than ever.",
      "Lastly, I want to thank myself for not giving up on every stage and trying to keep an optimistic approach in life, which I feel is the most essential element of my story.",

      "And things will mellow. And all this love will turn to friendship, tinged forever. After that, there will be only accidental meetings, a stray email, a long-lost text. Bojack‚Ä¶you all right?",
      "I was watching Bojack Horseman, and we received an email from the DoSA office:",
      "Keeping in view the well-being of the students, the Institute has mandated the UG students to leave the campus by 5 PM Monday (April 26th).",
      "We were forced to pack up our college experience in less than a week and leave the college that we‚Äôve spent years making our home in the midst of one of the most uncertain times of our generation. It was for the first time it hit me that we have to leave this beautiful place and never meet these people again. I felt nostalgic about the area, which had become home to many of us for four (3 years to be specific, credit to the person who ate bat soup üôÅ ) years. Four years have come and gone in the blink of an eye, and here I am writing ‚ÄúAs We Leave‚Äù as a graduating senior. Four years ago, it felt like we had all the time in the world to figure everything out. Those years have passed, and here we are, ready to face the real world as a grown-up.",
      "When I walked in as a fresher, ‚ÄúI knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.‚Äù ( pardon me if I quote too much from ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù, but it is the best show ever and watch it if you still haven‚Äôt). I entered IITK with the pretty common mindset of ‚Äúbranch hierarchy.‚Äù Choosing IITK was easy for me as at my rank, for a ‚Äúbetter institute,‚Äù you had to compromise on the branch. Plus, I had heard that IITK offered more flexibility in its curriculum and that MSE here is one of the best in the nation. So the plan was simple: To study hard and get a branch change and at the same time explore all the opportunities that the campus provided.",
      "The first semester in college is like rewinding to childhood, where everything seemed fascinating, awe-inspiring and full of mystique. We were warmly welcomed to the college by the CS team. Instructions, orientations, and fun began soon after. This sem of your IITK life is meant for exploring and experimenting. I made new friends, tried out new sports, picked up new activities‚Äîbasically did everything that I was unable to during my JEE preparation. I tried my best to learn and score well in every class while also trying to be part of multiple societies and participating in every workshop or talk. I even tried to mingle with various seniors to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù ( which sometimes backfired). I remember once I asked one of the HEC members to act in our short movie for the ART105 course stating ‚Äúnatural lagega‚Äù He was like ‚Äú, Apne baap se acting karaega‚Äù, and screamed at the top of his lungs, roaring the widespread cuss words. I was horrified, but now that I recall this memory, it always brings a smile to my face, and I feel lucky to have experienced this phase of IITK. The bond that was formed with the seniors while ‚Äúinteracting‚Äù was something that would remain forever. These were the same seniors who helped me in my 4 years whenever I was in doubt.",
      "Then there were my wingies who turned to family in no time. Somewhere between ‚Äú How will I SHARE MY ROOM WITH 2 people¬† !!‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow will I live alone in a room‚Äù ‚Ä¶.we learnt to share our lives!",
      "We gathered in the common area at 9 o‚Äôclock sharp and played LOCO, a trivia game. The sheer happiness and the satisfaction of winning that small amount of money was priceless. I was charmed by the kind of solidarity that developed among us. This solidarity resulted from sticking with each other through some hard times or even being around to drive a lizard out of a friend‚Äôs room.",
      "While trying to participate in everything that came constantly, I realised that I wasn‚Äôt able to excel in anything. My so-called ‚Äúsimple‚Äù plan of doing a branch change had failed, and I ended up with an SPI of 8.1 ( decent enough but inadequate to do a branch change).¬† Through that semester, I realised the importance of prioritising and time management. It taught me that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to prepare less for an exam if it means giving your best in some CP contest. However, there will also be situations when it‚Äôs essential to prepare for that quiz rather than cheer for your hall in galaxy performance. It is making these decisions and continuously balancing your time amongst academics, extra-curriculars, friends and responsibilities. That was my first prized lesson from IITK.",
      "I made peace with the fact that I was going to stay in Materials Science and engineering. By the start of my second semester, I was pretty convinced that I had to do coding ( thanks to ESC101 and my wingmates who introduced me to CP and online learning resources). I was lucky enough to get internships in my first and second year summers. These internships helped me decide what I wanted to pursue as a career. Over the next 4 semesters, I learnt a few things which I‚Äôll like to share:",
      "1)Figure yourself outCollege is the time many following people find out who they are, me being one of them. You will make mistakes, but you must learn from them. Take this piece seriously; finding yourself is one of the most important things you‚Äôll do in life.",
      "2)Don‚Äôt treat your CPI like a life and death situation. I know that you don‚Äôt accept anything other than an A, but sometimes your best effort might fall below the mark. Don‚Äôt let your grade mania destroy the meaning of what you‚Äôre learning. Soak in the knowledge, try your absolute best, and you will get what you deserve.",
      "3)Have more fun!Don‚Äôt wear yourself down to the point of having no energy to go out with your friends or to go to that cool event that only comes to campus once. You will remember the memories made with your friends and those once in a lifetime experiences",
      "4)‚ÄùGiven a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.‚Äù",
      "I vividly remember 10th August 2019, Day 1 of the Internship season, when I was shortlisted for an interview with Goldman Sachs. As told by most of the seniors that MSE students never get a day 1 intern, I felt lucky as I would at least get to experience the coveted ‚Äúday 1 hype‚Äù. The day turned out to be the best day of my life till now. I went to the interview and gave it naturally and calmly because, during the entire duration, I had in my mind that I was going to be rejected. I gave two rounds of interviews before lunch, and after that, we were told to leave. I will be deluding If I know that I wasn‚Äôt expecting a call for the third round. But after waiting till 2 pm, I felt that this was it for the day and decided to sleep. At 3:15 PM, I got a call from one of the IC that your third round is scheduled in 15 mins and asked me to report to LHC. I was still half asleep and couldn‚Äôt believe it. I somehow changed my clothes and reached LHC within 15 mins in the scorching heat. Now the pressure and anxiety were getting over me. Each minute felt like an hour. I was constantly discussing with my wingies the concepts or questions that they might ask. After spending nearly 2 hours waiting, one of the company representatives came and informed us that they had already selected the candidates and we all could leave. This came as a shock to me because I was waiting for an interview but left satisfied that I at least got an opportunity to be interviewed on day 1, and this experience would help me in future. Things went pretty standard after this. Me and Vaibhav, one of my wingmates, were going to our room after dinner and all of a sudden, I received a call from an IC, who was a¬† friend, and he said, ‚Äú Bhai 1 lakh ke kitne % ki party dega ‚Äù. I got numb for a moment and couldn‚Äôt speak for a minute.",
      "I have included this day in this article because this was the best day of my college life and holds a special place in my heart. Also, I learnt a lesson that can be very helpful in your stay at IIT Kanpur, and that is the power of positivity. Sometimes the things you want most to happen, don‚Äôt happen. And sometimes the something you never expect to happen does indeed happen. Wins are sweeter when the odds are low and stakes are high.",
      "To all non-circuital branch students, you may have heard that getting an intern or placement is difficult. It‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôll just say that the probability isn‚Äôt zero. Always give it a try. This holds for almost everything that you want to do in your life. There would always be people/statistics telling you that this is beyond your reach or isn‚Äôt meant for you. But to achieve it, you only need one person‚Äôs belief, and that is you. If you believe in yourself, just give it a try because as Michael Scott quotes Wayne Gretsky‚Äú‚ÄòYou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take.‚Äô‚Äù There is no absolute right or wrong when you decide. Just try your best not to regret this choice you made. From my experience, I can say, life is not linear. Every decision you make will only set you on the path of progress.",
      "After getting an internship, I had ample time to explore new realms and thus decided to be a part of the Techkriti Core team as Head Web & App. Being a part of the core team gave me the best of my times, be it the experiences of the learning opportunities through the work or the bond I have with some of my friends. It pulled me out of my shell and moulded me into a guy who went on to explore all the ‚Äúnon-trivial‚Äù stuff. It was these people with whom I experienced the Friday Nights and the best of ‚Äútrips‚Äù üòõ",
      "Then Covid-19 hit, and Techkriti‚Äô20 got cancelled, virtual internships and attending zoom calls became normal. This Corona didn‚Äôt taste bad; it just completely removed the sense of taste. This virus may have robbed us of our senior year, but it did not rob us of our happiness. I got to find some of my best friends who I can say would remain with me for the rest of my life. Friends that I know will always be there for me and bend over backwards for me. A special thanks to Sunit, Raghav, Nimish, Vaibhav, Gavish, Ananya and Prakhar, without whom I cannot imagine my campus life. The lockdown made me realise life is precious & that nothing/no one should be taken for granted.",
      "Our batch got lucky, and we indeed got a month to relive all the moments, have those weird photoshoots and tick off all the things that remained on the IITK bucket list. This one month made me realise to party hard while you still can. Because once you go out of the campus, you are going to miss those carefree days. You‚Äôll miss those final over drama with over 100+ people watching together in Lala ji‚Äôs canteen, that late-night mafia or poker games which would end up with some silly fight, those high drama cricket matches that you played in your wing where even scoring 10 runs was celebrated as a century, those bulla sessions in someone‚Äôs room who we forcefully entered and refused to vacate until the following day ( kyunki ab soye to breakfast miss ho jaega :P), those multiple rounds of GPL that you got from your squad after getting your internship, those gratuitous roaming around campus discussing grand philosophical theories derived by one of your friend, those sitting in front of the laptop to request a course at 2 PM only to see server error, those Friday afternoon lunch or Saturday breakfast and the list can go on because the memories made in these 4 years are countless.",
      "‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you‚Äôre in the good old days before you‚Äôve actually left them.‚Äù",
      "‚Ä¶.¬† As cliche as it may sound, believe me, this line hits hard when you realise that you have to leave this beautiful place.",

      "Anirudh Anil Ojha is a Y17 graduating student from the Computer Science & Engineering department. He presents an honest, unromanticised perspective of his 4 years at IITK.",

      "Note to reader: This article is not going to be an exposition of my resume ‚Äì that is boring and reductionist. It‚Äôs not going to be anywhere close to a description of my journey, because I can never capture that in 2000 words. Batchmates and juniors can take away nostalgia and fundae respectively from this, but honestly it‚Äôs just meant to be a fun read. My opinions on my time at IITK keep on changing, but here‚Äôs what I think of it ‚Äì as I leave.",
      "Me? I tried to be the loudest to sing the hall anthem and had mailed the warden complaining about Wi-Fi removal during Galaxy, both in my first year. I had a double dassa after two semesters and had confessed to plagiarism in two courses by my seventh. I once weighed 75 kgs and once weighed 90 kgs. I was the first from my batch to clear a job interview and have cried on a phone call for failing to get a Day 1 internship. I‚Äôve seen all passing grades, been high on every substance available on campus (and a few others) and fallen asleep in every course I‚Äôve attended. Read on.",
      "We love to romanticize our stories where we, the protagonist, have a complete character arc replete with struggles and an eventual victory. In this light, all our miseries and mistakes gain a sense of importance to the storyline. We overlook the sadness they caused and value the lessons they gave us, leading to the popular saying ‚ÄúI have no regrets‚Äù. While you may choose to look at your experiences in whichever light suits you, the fact remains that your life will suck for a good amount of time even if you make the best of decisions and especially if you don‚Äôt. I have made my fair share of mistakes and I regret them, but I can‚Äôt do anything but try to learn from them now so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Once I overslept and got late for a lab, and was cycling too fast. My cycle collided with that of another guy and he fell down and probably hurt himself. I did not stop and help him because missing one lab of that course would mean an F. That experience still saddens me and I wish I was a more careful person, but ALAS. The moral of this story is that this college is not Hogwarts which will magically turn everything around for you. It‚Äôs an amazing place with myriad possibilities and it‚Äôs up to you to make something of that.",
      "The best and worst thing about this place is that you can be whoever you want here. Sure, you don‚Äôt immediately deviate from the kind of person you were when you arrived. I used to refer to myself with ‚Äúhum‚Äù for the entirety of my first year. But if you are unsuspecting, this place slowly starts to creep into you, changing you one choice at a time until you don‚Äôt know if you are the same person anymore, much like the proverbial ship of Theseus. This is something you will likely hear from every graduating person, and is barely something that surprises me. In fact I would have been disappointed at anything less. Hailing from a small town and a time where the internet was just starting to democratize, I was open, even eager for this place and the people I meet here to totally terraform the person I was. I feel like my life is much bigger than it was when I arrived here and that is something I am glad about.",
      "Right, choices. In retrospect, it is amazing how the choices that mattered were the ones that I didn‚Äôt think too much about. I have spent hours analyzing what sort of internships/projects/courses to take but can‚Äôt remember one such decision that I can look back upon and say ‚Äúyeah, that was so pivotal in my journey‚Äù. But decisions like entering a long distance relationship in my first semester, attaching myself to debating, filling for Antaragni Manager in my third year just because a senior from my city asked me to ‚Äì these were decisions that dictated so much of how I spent my time in the upcoming years. Taking good choices comes innately to some people, and if you are part of this clique ‚Äì congratulations. Most others have to rely on sheer luck. Since most of our initial decisions here are influenced by those around us, we can either a) identify amazing people to surround ourselves with b) hope that the people we run into are amazing or c) hope that the wrong decisions we make don‚Äôt come to fruition. It will be terrifying, you‚Äôll love it.",
      "",
      "‚ÄúWhy do you want your life to be easy right now?‚Äù ‚Äì this is a tenet a Y12 alumnus had shared with me during a conversation, something that resonated deeply with me as it is the principle I‚Äôve followed all of my college life. It embodies the idea that your twenties are ‚ÄòThe Defining Decade‚Äô and you should ‚Äòmake the most of them‚Äô. It is for that that I have spent a lot of my time on campus running around ‚Äì from classes to the tennis court to working in teams to debating to trying to socialise etc. While I deem more chilled-out attitudes towards life equally viable ‚Äì heck, evenenviableat times ‚Äì I have often found it incredibly frustrating how afraid people are of being ambitious over here. You see it in the mocking comments and social tagging when a person tries something that remotely strays outside the {mean + standard deviation} of their peers. The reason, I believe is, every person‚Äôs own competitiveness and the insecurity it brings along, which is making them bring collective expectations down instead of pushing themselves up. At a place where I had hoped aiming high would be the norm, it‚Äôs somehow looked at as something that you have to hide since it‚Äôs much more cool to be ‚Äúchill‚Äù about life. As someone who‚Äôs the opposite of chill, I have had my share of meta-doubts about why I was stressed about things that others were lax about. It rarely made me change my original course of action, but in retrospect, I would choose to not worry about what others would think.",
      "During my orientation, we were waiting in the auditorium and we were asked to ask random questions to the seniors standing up on the stage. Like the little bitch that I was, I remember asking ‚ÄúI had thought there would be cool people doing cool shit here ‚Äì where are they?‚Äù I have met many such people over the years, and I must say it was NOT easy to find them. While a lot of the people who frequent the public eye are amazing, many of the best people I have met were reclusive and lazy, who would never advertise themselves and I‚Äôd have missed them if it were not for random chance or some good spotting from my side. People with the best taste in music, movies or literature, with vast knowledge on esoteric topics, and with the most sorted career plans will remain unknown if you never venture outside your wing and never initiate a fresh conversation. If there‚Äôs one advice I‚Äôd love to give you, it would be to give every person you come across a chance and look to learn from them. Some of my best memories from these four years would be the random discussions I‚Äôve had with these people ‚Äì over lunch in my mess, over code in Rajiv Motwani building, over masala Maggi in DOAA canteen, over subsidised cappuccino in CCD and over rolls (Kathi and otherwise) at way too many places. Sharing opinions and having debates on topics of no practical impact on anyone‚Äôs life remains a guilty pleasure, and BOY did we indulge.",
      "With the online semester and everything, our interpersonal interactions have obviously taken a hit. I would not have made any new contacts in my final year were it not for the one month I spent on campus (more on that later). To every person reading, I would say that the younger you are the more excited you should be to interact with seniors who have been through the journey that you are going to have. Be shameless in pursuing conversation with whoever appeals to you, because I guarantee you that the regret of never starting a conversation is much more than that of a failed one. I‚Äôve picked some of the best advice ‚Äì from career to relationships to music ‚Äì through being a pest to people and I am thankful to people who urged me to imbibe this shamelessness.",
      "No recollection of campus is complete without mentioning the vehicle that drives these interactions, the (in)famous ‚Äòculture‚Äô. I like to believe it is more than participation in GC events, memorising an introduction in Hindi or abiding by the ‚ÄòGolden Rules‚Äô. It is something that you breathe in from the very air around you, something that you can share only with another person from your alma mater, something that will make an alumnus from your institute respond to you out of the hundred people who may want to talk to them. The pandemic will undoubtedly leave its mark on every aspect of culture that wasn‚Äôt already eroded by changing times, but I hope that whatever replaces it is as worthy as the ones of yore. Freshers‚Äô Inferno, Galaxy and Takneek were among the most fun times of my first year because of the people and ideas they introduced me to.",
      "That being said, I wish the narrative around culture was healthier than we got. Your surroundings will try to make you do a lot of things ‚Äì from bringing out the best in you to making you hate people for arbitrary reasons. Some are fine with melding themselves into this great force, and paint themselves with the colours of their hall/club/cell. Some people thrash and resist against the crowd and canter along on their own paths. While there is no objectively better choice, one must optimize between their individuality and outside influence because no one else is doing that for them.",
      "",
      "A special mention in my memoir must go to the most fun time I‚Äôve spent on campus: April ‚Äì May 2021, which was (quite literally) the final semester on acid. Yes, there were a million things to rue. We had lost all of our final year, no treats outside campus, no airstrip photoshoots, no Antaragni, no Galaxy, situation deteriorating all over the country ‚Äì the list goes on. Two of my closest wingmates couldn‚Äôt come because of rising Covid cases. But each one of us used this time to purge ourselves of all the pent up emotions of the last year. Assignments and deadlines were forgotten as people strutted around in their vacation clothes and sunglasses in a month-long party. It was a time of reliving old memories while making new ones, of celebrating old connections and forging new bonds and I‚Äôm hugely grateful for being able to spend that time with some of the most special people in my life. Before we knew it, the shades we were using to pose for pictures were being used to hide tears. There is something about knowing that a familiar face is not going to be around which always makes you crack up, even if you took that face for granted when they were around. A year at home had pushed my emotions regarding campus memories so deep beneath my skin that I mistook that for them not being there at all. But walking the familiar paths and seeing those familiar faces brought everything right back and I am glad to have a chance at those goodbyes.",
      "Going back to my room after a year was therapeutic. Wiping off the layer of dust, I was greeted by a life that I had forgotten. My whiteboard with unfinished tasks that didn‚Äôt matter anymore. A moth-eaten box of cigarettes that I had not bought for myself. The clothes I was supposed to wash but did not. The router that we had forgotten to turn off, waiting dutifully for devices that had forgotten it. Books, notes and test papers from courses that I would never think about again. Each object sent me down a road of memories that I had stashed in some corner of my mind.",

My journey was unorthodox, but looking back, all I can see are good memories. Sleepless nights at the foyer, night long volleyball matches at Hall-2, those Antargani meetings at Hall-1 and the gazal night at Ostwal‚Äôs ended up being a month-long stay of all of my friends at his room. Although I faced the worst rejection one could ever think of (rejection from the SPO), I end my journey with a smile on my face because if IITK has taught me one thing it‚Äôs ‚ÄúResilience is Ones‚Äô¬† Armour‚Äù.",
      "I entered IITK with many expectations in my heart and ‚ÄúBranch Change‚Äù in my mind. My baapu was a 9 pointer and the perfect person for me to ask What should be one‚Äôs approach towards academics here?. I still remember his answer like yesterday; he said, ‚ÄúStudy as you did before 10th.‚Äù This was great news because I had the most fun, but he forgot to mention that, unlike school, one does not have to attend classes to have fun. Shortly after, I decided to be a part of the dramatics club for the simple reason that they said no pre-requisites. And this was the decision that gave me the gifts that I pride the most today‚Ä¶. my friends. It‚Äôs hard to believe now, but almost all my closest friends today were present with me at the time of my very first drameve-1. The first semester came and went, and I was having the time of my life, primarily because of Antaragni‚Äô17 (The best Antaragni that I witnessed.) But, only after looking at the grade sheet of the first semester did I realise that something was wrong. I got 4.6 SPI with an F in PHY-103A. I was distraught, but here I made the biggest mistake of my campus stay. I went into denial. I just didn‚Äôt care; although I gave almost no time to any extra-currics, I did not emphasise on my acads. The result was that although I improved the previous semester, I still ended my first year as a 5 pointer and with a backlog.",
      "I had no choice but to attend the summer semester for PHY-103, and this gave me an excuse to reconnect with my friends in the dramatics club. I was becoming a part of the team, and it was all starting to feel sorted. I passed 103 and entered my second year with a CPI just below 6. Again in total denial, I refused to accept that it was something to worry about, but second-year had something much worse in store for me. It started with a bang for me as the first few days were the most fun I ever had. It was drameve-1, but this time I was a part of the second-year team, and it was a blast. Then came Antaragni, where I could not decide whether I was interested in performing or not. Thankfully this decision was made easier by dengue, which prevented me from attending most of Antaragni. However, I did not perform; I was still an active member of the team and spent most of my time at practices. It was now becoming a pattern. Every semester started positively, then I stopped attending classes, screwed my midsems, panicked for a few days and repeat the same for endsem. The third and fourth semester was no different. But as you might guess, this was not at all sustainable.",
      "The third sem ended with a trip to inter IIT Cult meet, and it was funnnnn. The journey from Kanpur to Roorkee, then to Rishikesh and Haridwar was one to die for. It was a trip where friendships were forged by a mutual interest in rafting and stalking ;). But then came the real downfall, it followed a similar pattern as before, and it ended in probably the worst academic performance possible. My grades were F, F, F, D and C. This 2.something SPI destroyed any hope of landing an internship in the next semester and had me worried about a possible degree extension. All of this left me depressed. I came back for the summer semester and stayed away from anything that could distract me from my studies. But this, too, did not work. I was depressed and had no one to talk to. My best friend at the time, Nilay, dropped out of college which left me with no one to talk to. I was struggling to stay away from any other friends I had in the club.",
      "In the fourth semester, I also got the post of Manager, Dramatics Events at Antaragni‚Äô19, and the only reason I did not leave the post was to give me something else to do apart from academics and away from dramatics. This is very tough, but eventually, I started enjoying it and avoiding going to Hall-1 became an excellent motive to begin attending classes. I enjoyed the rush, and soon Antaragni came. Incharge of judges, venues and teams for dramatics, I was too busy, and the days flew by. All I remember was a very hectic and equally enjoyable time for me and my fellow managers Palak and Ratnesh. Antaragni was a success because my trick worked, and I got my first A in 5 semesters. This may seem a tiny thing for most, but for me, it was a reassurance that all is not lost. This hope was significant at that moment because I knew that none of the following three semesters could be less than 60 credits if I want to complete my graduation in time.",
      "Finally, it began, the sixth semester with a 65 credit load and three repeat courses. I decided to work with Anant on the Galaxy with a mutual agreement of not giving much time to Galaxy nukkad because that‚Äôs what screwed me over the last galaxy. It went as planned, I minded my own business, and finally, WE WON, not only Galaxy play but also Nawabs won GALAXY 2020. It meant a lot, but then COVID struck, and unknowingly my campus life was over. I left campus on 7th March 2020 to return on 14th March 2020‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs May 2021. I am still home.",
      "I came home and, after just a few days, realised that if I wanted to have any chance at getting placed, I needed to start preparing right away. It was exactly what I did. For more than eight months, my day started with Arrays and ended with Dynamic Programming. Although like everyone else, I wanted to get back to campus, I also realised that I no longer have to worry about my graduation date. After all of this came December 1st. Before Day-1, I had given some programming tests and rejected the chance of even applying in most others because of my 5.24 CPI. This meant that all I had was one interview on Day-2. All my eggs were in one basket, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to let them break. But alas, it wasn‚Äôt my day. I waited for the promised 2nd round till 2 a.m. and was finally rejected with just 1 round at 4 in the morning. The rest of my interviews were pretty similar, and after the 4th interview, I realised what seniors meant that after all one has been through, it‚Äôs luck that decides the final placement. I tried for six horrible days and nights and then decided to give up hope of campus placement.",
      "The off-campus placement had been taboo, but if anyone is reading this and feel that it‚Äôs all over if one fails in campus placements, trust me, you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. All it takes is determination and a drive to take control of your life. I gave it all. I remade my resume, added all-new skills and even in 2 semesters, pulled my CPI from 5.24 to over six by scoring all As and Bs in my last two semesters. (Probably)",
      "I learned the hard way that every rejection is an inspiration, and all you have to do is work on yourself and get better. Because in the end, when you would be thinking about your college life an hour after your last exam, it‚Äôs the happy memories, the lessons you‚Äôve learned and the friends you‚Äôve made that will come to mind.",

      "Debashish Reang is a Y17 B.Tech student from the Department of Electrical Engineering. He writes an account of his journey through his undergraduate days at  IITK and his experiences through the four years of Engineering.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K",
      "‚ÄúHello, Dada. Can you lend me some money? Yeah, we‚Äôve been asked to empty our rooms, and the post office won‚Äôt post trunk or trolleys, so I‚Äôll have to send them via a private courier which charges ‚Çπ100/kg. Yeah, about ‚Çπ8,000 would do. Thanks!‚Äù My time at IIT Kanpur came to an abrupt end, weeks before I expected it to. I had just been discharged from a city hospital and was just starting to recover. Because of the unforeseen circumstances arising from the second wave of COVID-19 in the country, the institute mandated all UGs to leave the campus by Apr 26, 2021. Moments after a friend broke the news on the wing WhatsApp group, we sat together and decided on our return journeys. I booked a flight to return home at about 2 A.M. that morning while getting emotional about what had just happened. The next day, we did wing photoshoots, said our last goodbyes, and slowly started departing campus.",
      "If you know me or asked me about campus life at some point, I probably told you how excited I was about the prospect of leaving the place. Well, that wasn‚Äôt a lie. I always wanted to leave IIT Kanpur, and I knew that the time to depart would come one day, but I just did not know how soon it would be. I guess I hate the idea of being told what to do. I did not have much choice, so I came to terms with reality, washed my clothes, packed my sneakers, and headed home. I still do not know what I want from life or what I‚Äôm going to do shortly. But, my IITK journey has been a wholesome one, and this essay is an attempt to let you in on some of the experiences I‚Äôve had on campus. And, if you‚Äôre looking for a ‚Äústarted as an introverted-shy-guy but am graduating as an extroverted-everything-sorted-guy‚Äù story, close this tab right now because my story is nothing like that! I‚Äôve always been an outgoing sort of person. My life isn‚Äôt sorted at all. I am currently going through many dilemmas that need figuring out, broken family relationships that need repair, and economic status that needs raising.",
      "The quest to educate their children to the highest levels possible ran in the family from as early as I can remember. I think most of it stemmed from their life experiences. Both of my parents did not finish high school. My mother lost her father to Tuberculosis, and my father had a complicated life himself. So, a child of hers becoming a doctor was very important for dear mother. They did not spare any efforts in educating their children. I think part of that came from realising that education has the power to change the world and economic status even. Why I chose not to pursue a medical career is something that needs thinking. But, by some stroke of luck, I landed up at IITK. I still remember the hot, rainy July month when I first went to Uttar Pradesh. My worldview by that point was indeed limited, and I did not know what to expect. I saw extreme poverty under the flyovers in Lucknow, along the roads in Kanpur, saw cars taking a detour because of cows on the highway, and thought to myself, ‚ÄúDamn! Kanpur is dirty.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we have poor people where I come from, but the level of extreme poverty that I saw was a first. To rub salt to my wounds, I expected a huge-ass gate on our entry to IITK, but by the time I realised we were inside IITK, no gate came except a railway crossing. I think this pretty much sums up my experience at IITK.",
      "Expectations that pay off to nothing at the end.",
      "The Orientation Week was one of the best weeks of my stay on campus. This was true for my orientation and accurate as well for Y18‚Äôs orientation. This second-year guy proclaimed to his friends, ‚ÄúYeh mera baccha hai.‚Äù rather proudly and helped me get through all the initial hurdles. Senior girls who would enthusiastically ask juniors for their introduction would not press further as soon as they come to know I‚Äôm his ‚Äúbaccha.‚Äù For that, I‚Äôm ever thankful to him. I would later try to pass on this empathetic treatment to my ‚Äúbacchas‚Äù when I became an SG. Seniors are the people you reached out to when you‚Äôre in a dilemma. They‚Äôre the ones who advised kids to turn down Friday evening invitations to Hall 1. They just seemed to have an endless store of knowledge on everything, from the best dance moves and best crowd-songs togyaanon how the campus functions, which courses to take, and which lines to step on in the airstrip, and which ones are forbidden. Chappals seemed to be the footwear of choice, and Boxers the preferred choice for bottom wear. They could preach over a congregation of eager first years and lead them to salvation as the poor kids ran, holding their blue folders on either hand and pretended to have wings.",
      "Once the academic grind started, I kind of got lost in assignments and deadlines. Going into the program, I did not know what Electrical Engineering has in store or what engineers do. I hated ‚ÄúEngineering Drawing,‚Äù also called TA101A, and I hated ‚ÄúIntro to Electrical Engineering (ESO203A).‚Äù I still do not know what it is that I love. If I learned two things from my time at IITK, it is never to pursue Electrical Engineering once I got out of that place and that North Indian slangs are okay. I have no intentions of stepping back from those realisations. Things got so bad at one point that I contemplated leaving the institute and going off to another place. A kind professor advised me to stay on because I was close to finishing the degree anyway. His advice gave me some clarity on things, and more importantly, I‚Äôm graduating debt-free by staying on. I cannot tell you if that were the right decision or the wrong one, only time would tell that. But, since then, I‚Äôve come to realise that your time at IITK is what you make it to be. All the fantastic people make IITK what it is, not the curriculum, the administration, or the structure. It took me a hockey-field breakup, a couple of sleeping pills, and a life-changing humanities class to start swearing. It probably sounds absurd, but when you‚Äôre not used to speaking a particular language or used to saying that language in a certain way, it is hard to get into the local way of speaking. I‚Äôm happy to report that I‚Äôm one of you now.",
      "‚ÄúShuru majboori mai kiya tha, ab mazaa aane laga hai.‚Äù",
      "I was sad, angry, and truthfully, heartbroken when I discovered that I‚Äôd have to live in a separate wing starting from the second year. I‚Äôm sure my friends did not mean to single me out, and it was probably childish of me to fret over something as stupid and random as wing allocation. But, at the time, it felt sickening beyond measures to imagine going to an entirely new wing and living with a separate set of people with whom you have not interacted much in your first year. This was the first incident that made me realise the importance of belonging to a particular group. The second moment of realisation of this sense of belonging would come a few years later when I would be hospitalised for a viral fever at the onset of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The truth is that I love being alone. I always have. Good coffee, an excellent novel, and good music in my ears are all I ever wanted. I understand that I did not precisely fit into the kind of guy they would like in their group. To quote a friend, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt dislike youper se, but you probably aren‚Äôt good enough for their group.‚Äù",
      "Just after the wing allocation fiasco, I fell sick and was in the ICU for four days. Of course, unsurprisingly, my friends came along to the hospital and cared for me. I‚Äôm genuinely grateful for their friendship. As I said, grief over wing allocation was childish, but I felt pretty bad at that time. I went to the DoAA office to get a medical leave approved and then apply for a makeup lab for the TA201A welding lab. But, the gentleman at the office said that my leave could not be approved. Why? Because the doctor did not explicitly ‚Äúgive in writing‚Äù that I was unfit to go for welding post my ICU discharge. When I reasoned with him, saying I had hospital bills as proof, he disagreed with discussing further. The course instructor eventually approved my makeup lab without a formal medical leave after I wrote an email to him describing my situation. I would discover that awful experience at administration offices is constant across state borders and institutions. Things are just supposed not to work. I hated trips to the hospital and admin offices, but obviously, this wouldn‚Äôt be the last during my B.Tech.",
      "‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a crush on her forever, and that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs ever going to happen.‚Äù",
      "I probably have more crushes than is typical. If you pretend that you‚Äôve liked only one person, then you‚Äôre one of the more determined ones, or you‚Äôre just lying! My first crush on campus was on this overly cute girl I came across in the ‚ÄúIntroduction to Philosophy‚Äù class. I had a more compelling reason to attend the classes. In contrast, others spent a month debating whether the table in front of the classroom was a table or just ‚Äúan essence‚Äù of a table. The table was clearly in front of the class. Just go and touch that damn thing if you had any doubt! I even signed up to dance during Freshers‚Äô Night. I never danced in my life, not at least the choreographed ones. I know it‚Äôs wild, but I‚Äôm so glad that I volunteered because that night was fun, and more importantly, because the person I had a crush on at that time was dancing too. Oh, for those of you asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened after that?‚Äù Nothing! We are graduating, and that‚Äôs that.Expectations that pay off to nothing at the end. I don‚Äôt know a lot about love. Most internships last longer than the time I‚Äôve been in love. If you‚Äôre overly friendly, with a cute face that gives out theoretical and practical advice after hearing people out, ‚Äúfriendzone‚Äù kind of happens. If you think you‚Äôll win a heart over by sharing relatable lyrics and songs, you‚Äôre f****d. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. Do you know what works? Nothing!",
      "If you‚Äôre overly friendly, with a cute face that gives out theoretical and practical advice after hearing people out, ‚Äúfriendzone‚Äù kind of happens.",
      "I think my love would have lasted longer if it weren‚Äôt for something as f**ked up as ‚ÄúGalaxy.‚Äù What is ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù if not Wannabe-Lawyers persevering? People would come up with their usual ‚ÄúRulebook‚Äù bullshit for each and everything. It looks pretty absurd to me ‚Äì people come up with and write rules in the Rulebook, and the same set of people find loopholes that they, later on, use to get events that they did not win scrapped. These people should get ‚Çπ50 added to their no dues amount for overacting. Instead of fussing over the rules, a better alternative would have been to put equal effort into the events so that the best pool may win. I saw two very admirable seniors fighting over points of an event that I helped organise. I‚Äôm not going to lie; it was hilarious. And they cancelled that event later on. My guess is the pool that wanted to win very badly did not win. There would always be someone who would go around your hall and call only you for every event to add to this misery. I remember once getting called for something to do with Hindi Sahitya Sabha (I cannot read Hindi xD). My dream is to see ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù happen sometime soon, where every event gets scrapped and every pool stands at zero points. My suggestion to break that tie would be to organise a grand sword fight on Auditorium grounds among the pool captains.",
      "I‚Äôm known for sharing my unfiltered thoughts on social media. While many people appreciate this frank and honest nature of mine, I know that not everyone thinks that way, and that is okay. I remember getting some stares during one of the initial ELS meets for something I defended ferociously. Oh, screw ELS. It is okay to change your views when presented with new information. I think I‚Äôve grown more in this aspect, as compared to anything else. I believe that the dignity of human life and the well-being of humankind are above every institution and ideology. I think we can all appreciate that humanity is above all else. Every development, discussion that happens should be centred around the upliftment of everyone and not just the privileged bunch. If growth is happening at the cost of persecution of one section of the society, that is not development. After all, would you measure human progress by the number of buildings, bridges, and airports that get built or by the quality of lives of humankind as a whole? Some people have stopped talking to me because of this, and that is okay. I don‚Äôt need that negative energy in my life.",
      "Given the times that we‚Äôre in, I think viewing humanity above all else can sometimes get one into trouble. Nothing has happened so far, but you can‚Äôt predict the future. With elected representatives throwing around conspiracy theories left and right, and preaching things not backed by science, it is all the more reason to speak up. The way I see it, humankind and its empathy would stand the test of time compared to the divisive rhetoric and bigotry that we are so used to hearing from everyone. It boils down to you at the end of the day ‚Äì how you wish to use your influence and privilege. Sure, you may choose to remain neutral, you know, like the ones for whom everything is complicated, even if someone is getting stabbed in front of their eyes. You can do that, but I have no respect for you in that case. For many people on campus, IITK represents an isolated heavenly abode that is supposed to be devoid of influences of its times and the society it serves. That is such a privileged position to take. If you cannot use your intelligence and influence to bring about good to the community you‚Äôre serving, should you even exist in that society?I‚Äôd never attended a Baarat in my life until ‚ÄúHall 1 ki Baarat.‚Äù Sure, I watched marriage proceedings in movies, but I did not experience any in real life. If you‚Äôre getting married soon, remember to invite me to your Baarat. When the day of the Baarat came, I was more excited than most final years. If you‚Äôre curious, none got shot and fell off the horse. The event was overall poorly managed but fun. They closed the gates to people other than the final year students. Everyone who had a life at IITK would remember bonding over random dance moves to Bhojpuri songs. That night was one of such nights. I came to know many Y17s, whose existence I did not know about, until that point. Somewhere in that crowd, a naive kid thought, ‚Äúnext year.‚Äù But Coronavirus had other plans. I don‚Äôt think anyone would have even come close to being a Dulhan compared to me. That is a wish that shall remain a wish.Expectations that pay off to nothing at the end.",
      "At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, I had to run to the hospital because someone I cared about was dying. I was clueless, powerless, and felt that I could not breathe. I did not sleep for three days straight. I just could not imagine an alternative reality where people close to me dying made sense. The ambulance was out of fuel. The bridge on the road connecting my locality to the hospital had collapsed because bridges collapsing after a long time are no surprise. I was angry at everyone and more so at myself for not being able to anything. I still get chills when I think about the dozens of families who would have lost their loved ones because the ambulance did not have fuel or the hospital did not have enough staff. Medical infrastructure is all but non-existent in Tripura. No matter which party and which people come to power, none thinks about upgrading the critical infrastructure in the state. I believe the current pandemic exposed the failures of governments, both past and present. However, if hundreds of thousands of people take deaths and hospitalisations to come to that realisation then someone somewhere has f**ked up or is actively f**king up.",
      "As a kid living in a more or less homogeneous society, you‚Äôre not used to thinking about your identity all that much. The concept of ST, SC, OBC, etc., was unheard of where I come from because everyone is tribal. So, when someone did not get a seat at IITB or the so-called ‚Äútop-branches‚Äù at IITK and decided to go, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs it!‚Äù I‚Äôm going to write about you on Facebook.‚Äù I had a hard time digesting it. I‚Äôm proud to be tribal, and there is nothing you can say or do to change that. This roots and appearance thing led to some hilarious incidents as well. During Antaragni 2018, a Chinese guy came up to me and started speaking Mandarin (from what I assumed). When I told him that I did not speak Mandarin and that I‚Äôm an Indian, he showed me his Chinese passport and said that I looked like one of them. I was so excited by that episode that I lost my college ID and debit cards that night. People assumed or asked me if I‚Äôm from Nepal or Bhutan, or China at various points. I don‚Äôt know if I should be happy or sad about them.For the record, I‚Äôm Indian, and I think ours is the greatest nation and civilization on Earth.",
      "Throughout my time at IITK, I‚Äôd come to be associated with many groups. Some of them were short-lived, while others lasted longer. I participated in journalism, company formation, departmental well-being, debates, and the well-being of other students. At times, I even called strangers trying to convince them to come to attend one of our on-campus events or call someone else to fill up L18 with random school kids so that the events would look ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù I found my sense of belonging in Quiz Club. It is the best club on campus. Slide after slide, someone would raise their hand and whisper magic words into the ears of the Quizmaster. The Quizmaster would then give their verdict on whether to reward or punish these whispers. I miss in-person quizzes so much. I used to get so excited about late-night quizzes. I would sometimes skip dinner to make it on time to LitSoc Room before everyone else when running one of my quizzes. Quiz Club gave me a few hours of peace and excitement, away from the worries of daily life. When I told people I have a quiz, it usually meant that I was sure about attending that particular quiz night instead of the usual academic examinations. I loved Quiz Club so much that I‚Äôd go on to ‚Äúcoordinate‚Äù its activities and get screwed by ‚Äúthe Rulebook‚Äù during Galaxy.",
      "I had a hard time balancing academics with extracurriculars. So, I did the sensible thing ‚Äì no, I did not reduce the number of things I was taking part in; I stopped taking part in all of them. You know, that‚Äôs like Trump saying stop testing people, and we‚Äôll have fewer cases. It did not work out for Trump, neither did it work out for me. That is one of the decisions that I regret. I think it would have been much better if I had continued the extracurriculars but narrowed down the number of things I took part in. But, things are still not as bad. I loved working with folks at E-Cell, pitched random startup ideas to VCs during events, and enjoyed interacting with alumni. During my short stint with Vox Populi, I proposed conducting a first-year student survey on various aspects. Even though I was not involved in running the survey eventually, I‚Äôm happy that the idea got to see the light of the day. Being an SG was a fulfilling experience. I learned many things while talking to several people to resolve the problems the ‚Äúbacchas‚Äù had. I have no idea about how large my family tree has grown, but it is a dream to see Hall 5 populated only with my descendants someday.",
      "I had had my fair share of sufferings when it came to adjusting to the mess food. I used to be amazed by people who survived on a fewrotis.On top of that, it seemed like whatever culinary skills one lacked could be covered up by a pinch ofdhaniaand a few litres of cooking oil as someone who eats rice thrice a day and is not used to eating oily food all that much, getting used to North Indian food was a struggle. I would go to different canteens to try out new food items and stick to one that worked the best. I frequented Hall 4 canteen to eat their Chicken fried rice and Chicken Manchurian rice at Hall 5 canteen. I hate pizzas, paneer, burgers, and ketchup. I especially hate people who put ketchup in their Maggi. If you are around OAT, you should try chicken roll with some ice cream. Latte is my favourite coffee drink, and I especially love anything that has chocolate in it. The best food on campus has to beGol gappe.I love them so much that I ate 20 of them in one go on my last day on campus. If all those things sound expensive, you should try egg fried rice in your hostel mess. That is the best thing one could eat on any given day, in my opinion. I am very particular about my food habits, which is well reflected in other domains, e.g., music.I had two end-semester examinations on Dec 11, 2020. And if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôd also know thatEvermoredropped that day. I submitted the first endsem about 1.5 hours ahead of time and listened to the album instead. I did not study for the other one. I think music can have a significant impact on your mood and general well-being. It had a substantial impact on me. I would even claim that music helped me get through my worst days on campus. I‚Äôm the kind of person who would loop through Taylor Swift, Lorde, and Ed Sheeran for days. And listen to Selena Gomez‚Äôs whispers for hours. With two back-to-back albums in about six months, Taylor Swift helped me get through the worst days of the pandemic. I mean, I‚Äôd still love her unconditionally even if she did not do that. The dream upon graduation was to attend one of her in-person concerts during the Asian leg of her tour. But, I think that wish will probably stay a wish. The pandemic does not seem to be ending anytime soon, and in-person live concerts will probably take a long time to return.Expectations that pay off to nothing at the end.",
      "My second trip to a city hospital happened just a few weeks ago. I was diagnosed with a viral fever and got to stay at the hospital for four days. Those four days were probably the worst in a long time. Because of the situation arising from the pandemic, none of my friends was with me at the hospital. I spent the next four days staring at the white ceiling and counting numbers up and down. Things got so depressing that I had to tell the doctor how lonely I felt and how depressing the whole vibe was. The doc was terrific and discharged me on the same day. Just as I was leaving the hospital, I overheard my hospital roommate‚Äôs conversations. He described in painful detail how difficult it was to get a bed at the hospital. That‚Äôs when I realised the privilege I had. He was on oxygen support and could not find a bed until he went back and forth to two or three hospitals. I remember getting a bed as soon as I was a little stable and got my tests done. It did not take hours for me to find a bed. I would probably have met the same fate if I did not study at IITK. If there is one thing that I want you to take away from this essay, most people are decent people. If it weren‚Äôt for the fantastic roommate in the hospital, I would have had a far worse time at the hospital. His family bought drinking water for me (the hospital canteen does not accept UPI payments!) and cared for me as if I was one of their own.If I could start my undergraduate life all over again, I would probably take Biology in Grade 12 and attend a medical college. And avoid Electrical Engineering at all costs. Contrary to popular opinion, I loved LIF101A. And I‚Äôll probably study some more Biology given a chance. Oh, I‚Äôll not go to IIT Kanpur in that version of the life. Are you kidding me? The sex ratio is horrible, so is the weather. These were not on top of the list of things that matter when I joined IITK, but I‚Äôve since realised that both of them are pretty important to one‚Äôs well-being. To add fuel to the fire, it turns out that I did not like my engineering courses at all. As a bonus, my mother would be delighted with her son. I still wish it was possible to study History or English Literature at Delhi University. But, life has its ways. So, it is what it is.Expectations that pay off to nothing at the end. Don‚Äôt even ask me why I‚Äôm interested in History or English Literature.If you know, you know!",
      "As I Leave IITK, I realise that I‚Äôm an imperfect being, in fact, quite far from being perfect. There was a time when that fact would be unsettling, but I think you come to accept what you are over time. That‚Äôs the only good part about ageing, I suppose. I know I‚Äôm not perfect, but I think I‚Äôm pretty good to everyone. That‚Äôs just like my 4.68 Uber ratings. You know, pretty good but not perfect. Thanks, IITK, for being a gracious host. And thank you to everyone who played some part in shaping my college journey. Hopefully, one day I‚Äôd get to go back to campus as an assistant professor or politician, preaching things I don‚Äôt mean. Until then, let life happen.",

      "Shivam Mandloi is a Y16 BTech+MDes (Design) student, graduating this year. In this memoir, he writes about his rollercoaster journey through the 5 years he spent at IITK.",
      "Five years, those were my five years in IITK.",
      "So let me first introduce myself, Shivam Mandloi‚Ä¶ Bas ‚ÄúMandloi‚Äù, that‚Äôs what my wingies call me. At least they cared to spell my name correctly üôÇ Although I belong from a small district Khargone (M.P.) but most of my childhood was spent in Ujjain. My primary department was Aerospace. It was the childhood dream of my best-friend. I had no one to guide me in school days. So that innocent me, with no dreams but only the desire to make my family‚Äôs life easier, simply bought his dream. My JEE rank was enough to get me AE at IITK and I was overly motivated by the then released Sci-Fi Interstellar, Martians & blah blah blah‚Ä¶ f#ckin mainstream commercial shit. So, I chose to go with the flow.",
      "First year was mostly about culture, ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô and shitload of timepass. It was a period of transition for all of us, from an innocent child protected by our families into a person trying to make a place in this new world. With all the masti and timepass, here comes a well-deserved ‚ÄúPanji‚Äù! I always had a knack of being consistent so I kept on getting panjis for couple of semesters.",
      "Never mind the CPI, the enthu was there for rescue, we enjoyed our days to the fullest. Being a hardcore Ronaldo fan since 2010, I am glad to witness those days of glory here in IITK. I still remember those UCL nights at OAT with our football buddies. IITK had a brilliant Football culture.",
      "",
      "Every new semester begins with the same old resolution of working for better CPI. Now I was quite used to it, we got used-to with everything at IITK. But not we were not used-to being without our friends. The incident in our 2nd year got my friends suspended. It was a very unfortunate and devastating experience for us. We were all depressed after that incident, although the pain could not be matched with those suspended but the pain was real. It clearly reflected in our academics. That semester, my entire wing scored their lowest ever SPI. Some of us received their only backlog in that hell of a semester.",
      "I started feeling lonely, I had no motivation at all, my enthu was completely drained to the point that I would have kept myself locked in my room during the entire Antaragni.",
      "But there come my wingies, trying to cheer up me to attend the EDM night, they literally dressed me up with their own hands and dragged me out of my room. If not for them, it would not have been possible to break out of that slump. They are the best wingies for a reason!",
      "Yes, I got addicted to Korean Cinema! First Korean movies and then ultimately K- dramas & K-pop too! I had started watching all these stuff from my 2nd year, but then it turned into addiction during my 3rd year. I started binge watching kdramas and movies a lot, even to the extent of missing lectures. Well to be honest, I thoughtkya hi farak padta hai, I had already lost my interest in the core subjects, so I never bothered about them. While all the guys around me were trying to get hold of internship-offers, my lazy ass was lying on the bed, busy in an entirely different world. Just watching Asian movies and dramas all the time, missing out on social-life. My life was in a pause mode at that time. I didn‚Äôt have a plan about my career. I just had aChaggi(5.98 CPI) so I thought let‚Äôs forget about the intern and go with the flow.",
      "I thought I had lost my ability to work hard, I was getting too lazy. But then in 6thSem, HSS department offered a course named ART401 ‚ÄúAppreciating Far Eastern Cinema‚Äù. The very word ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù was more than enough to ignite my interest. I was one of the unlucky ones, who did not get the course in the HSS lottery! I guess all of us at IITK can relate to the struggle of getting an HSS course during the add-drop period. Well for the first time after couple of years, I thought, let‚Äôs try to be a bit persistent,thoda effort maar lete he yaar!",
      "Imagine following the Prof after the bell rings, from the lecture hall, all the way to his bike, he is constantly rejecting your request as if he is testing your patience. And that‚Äôs how I got this course. Surely, Profs are humans too.",
      "Now, for the first time in my life, I secured 100% attendance for any course, lectures used to be in the morning, still that enthusiasm to attend those lectures knowing you are definitely going to learn something new every day. So, the classes were extremely fun & knowledgeable (at least for the cinephiles). The teachings from Prof. Dr. Ritwij Bhowmik had immense impact on the way I used to perceive cinema.",
      "Although I was already into Korean Cinema but the lectures helped me to broaden my horizon. Now I started exploring cinemas from all the other prominent Asian countries. Entire credit for this goes to my Professor. Yes, Ritwij Sir you are the coolest Prof I have ever met. So, the semester ended on quite a high note. But then it all got back to the usual race against the time. Summers were approaching and so was the placement season!",
      "While most of my batchmates were strengthening their resumes with interns and projects, some delusional hopeless guys like me were spending the Summers in campus taking extra credits, to improve our CPI. Well, this time I got lucky, with the lottery system. I was taking two courses- Prob & Stats for placement prep and a course on Chinese Cinema, which later ended up getting me an A* grade! Still, I didn‚Äôt have any plan, I was trying to get hold of every possible options- CAT, UPSC, Placements. Then, comes the decisive moment. Me & my summer term roomie (all time Aero buddy,haan Soni teri hi baat ho rhi hai) were just about to finish off watching the 4 hour long Taiwanese classic ‚ÄúA Brighter Summer Day.‚Äù Amidst that frustrating summer, that good-for-nothing buddy finds himself motivating me to at least contact Ritwij Sir. Well, it was the second time I was to email a Prof for seeking guidance, first time was in the end of the previous chaotic semester. Guess what, this time it worked. He introduced me to a whole new option- a Dual Degree in Design! I was very happy after meeting Prof Bhowmik, but again the struggle was not yet over. The application deadline for the Design program had already passed. This time it was the struggle with the administration. Writing tons of emails & letters to the concerned authorities, regularly making rounds to DOAA office and meeting several professors begging for the opportunity. That was my routine till the last day of the summer term. Those days were extremely frustrating & depressing. Remember, I had decided to be persistent. I learnt that every effort counts in the end. If it was not for my last effort trying to meet with the professors at the last moment, all my efforts would have been in vain.",
      "Finally, that depressing period ended on good terms. Within the strict administration, there are still some supportive professors who care for their students and IITK will be forever grateful to them!",
      "Now, I had an additional year with an additional prospect(BTech+MDes) in hand. So, that was the new beginning. While my wingies were busy with there placements, I had a whole new secondary department to explore. Design courses were not that bad, in fact most of them were quite fun with all my fun-loving and caring MDes buddies. Believe me MDes peeps are the coolest matkas in IITK. So, it was all going smooth, but then suddenly I came across an insane opportunity that even I had never dreamt of. I told my Prof about this NCTU-IIT Elite Internship Program and he encouraged me to go with the application process. Guess what, NCTU (Taiwan) was Ritwij Sir‚Äôs alma mater! He helped me, again, through the application process and finally the opportunity came knocking at my door.",
      "This turned out to be a wonderful opportunity, especially for me. Each and every moment I spent in Taiwan was a learning opportunity for me not just as a student but more as a person. This was the first time I was on a foreign land. I was very careless, lost my bag containing all the crucial documents & laptop in a High-Speed Rail. I was also, completely clueless at that time, worrying about the situation and guess what, in merely 3 hours I received all lost items back and intact. That was just a trailer, for every new day was waiting with a new surprise. I started exploring the university and the nation, it was full of surprises. I noticed how much their education system differed from us. The usual rat race and race against time was not as intense there as in IITs, instead they focused more on learning based on application. At least that was the case in their universities.",
      "Almost all the professors I met there in Humanities Department were not just very kind and cooperative but were also very cool, irrespective of their age. They all treat their students as their friends. No wonder, why Prof Bhowmik is so approachable as well. Their classes were highly interactive, even a student like me who used to shy away from profs could easily interact with all of them together. Language was never the issue, they kept more emphasis on communicating ideas and learnings, that was just enough for the students. I made many good friends in Taiwan and many of them are still in touch.",
      "All those memorable trips, night life, party culture, Taiwanese food, freely roaming in the streets at night without any worry & many such memorable moments, just thinking about them gives me chills. I have nothing but the utmost respect & admiration for Taiwan as a nation.",
      "Do you believe in God? Well, I don‚Äôt. I believe in Goddess, Goddess IU ‚Äì one of the most respected and powerful figures in Korean entertainment industry.",
      "I have been a big fan of IU since I started exploring k-pop. It was her last concert tour in December 2019 just before the pandemic. I was extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time. Believe me, IU‚Äôs Live Concerts are truly energizing. I spent my entire scholarship on just buying that ticket, that too at double the price (since tickets were sold out within couple of minutes on the official website). If you ask me, it was still worth each penny!",
      "I returned back home for my last semester with my buddies. It was going to be full of extreme fun. Indeed, we had a lot of fun and why not, since all my wingies were placed, while I was enjoying my time in Taiwan. Little did we know that it would end earlier than expected. Covid struck and we returned back home!",
      "Well, to be honest, I still had no plans about the future, but the pandemic was and still is the truth. So, PhD was clearly not an option especially in Arts & Humanities. I thought the wise thing to do was to first get a job. Since it‚Äôs my 5th & final year so I already had an idea about the preparation for placements. Started with the resume building. Now, I was a 9 pointer in MDes to compensate for my lower grades in BTech. Yes, I am lazy but not dumb! Since Design courses are mostly project based so they were of great help in building my resume. Even I had options in UI/UX Designer profile but it was never my motive to pursue the degree. So, I prepared for usual non-core profile jobs. We all knew that this year it was going to be difficult and I understood that persistence is the key to the placements.",
      "After 3 full night outs, on the 3rdday of the placements, it was technically my 13thinterview, which finally got me placed at ICICI Bank. Imagine going through several round of interviews in several companies, just to realize that a single 20 min voice interview round gets you placed where you had least expectations. Friends & even family were great mental support throughout the placement season.",
      "Since the pandemic had hit us hard, let‚Äôs be honest we all were desperately waiting for that one email from admin calling us to return back to campus. IITK didn‚Äôt disappoint this time. But this time going back to campus wasn‚Äôt the same as before, and how could it be, without my beloved batchmates from Y16. Still, I managed to have a whole new experience and it was again quite memorable. Since it was surely my last semester, so I tried to relive every moment to its fullest. Thanks to my fellow dual degree & MTech peeps. Honestly, for the first time, after a year I felt alive! We all missed the campus very badly. The campus was almost revived to its usual charm but then again, the second wave struck. After an unfortunate incident, a group of people, including me, were asked to leave the campus.Haan bas yhi dekhna bacha tha TT.We tried to figure out all the possibilities to return back to campus, just in case covid gets under control. But deep down we all knew that this was the end of our chapter.",
      "Evening of 30th March 2021, after a full nightout. I packed my stuff for the last time, left my room, went down through the stairs of Hall-9 for the last time. Every step took me further & further from my beloved IITK. As soon I reached the quad, suddenly tears started rolling down through my eyes. I tried my best to hold them back. Signed off the hall register, returned back the room key. My cab was waiting and I was already getting late for the bus. Out of the hall gate, all my close friends were there to bid a final goodbye. Knowing that this was the last moment with my friends, I could not hold back anymore. I burst out of tears. My eyes were full of tears throughout the way to Fazalganj. I was just able to catch my bus. Conductor seeing my red eyes, rushed back in search of the lost temperature gun. And that damn beep ultimately broke the moment!",
      "I am writing this in May 2021, and I am yet to finish the 1st draft of my thesis which is actually based on Korean Cinema (Hallyu Wave, to be precise). Well, as you know, I was never the guy with a plan. Nothing to worry though, IITK has mastered us well in getting our job done before the deadline!",
      "Some final words-Life me thoda chill karo yaar, do whatever you like, never lose opportunities to explore, be persistent, do your best for the moment and let things unfold naturally. Even if IITK can‚Äôt always guarantee a job or clarify your life goals, but I assure you IITK will definitely find the best version out of you.",
      "Let us end this journey with this memorable dialogue from one of my favourite movie Parasite:",

      "Saptarshi Paul is a Y19 MSc student from the Department of Chemistry. He shares his story through the 2 years he spent at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Never did I even dare to imagine that a mediocre Bengali student like me would get to enter the glorious gates of IIT Kanpur! But exactly that happened on the 20thJuly, 2019. I had the privilege of pursuing¬† my Master‚Äôs (M.Sc.) in Chemistry from this splendid institute. There were so many questions, uncertainties and doubts, but they started to gradually subside as our auto entered the main gate and I saw¬† ‚ÄúIndian Institute of Technology Kanpur‚Äù inscribed on the wall. With my eyes wide open, I looked left and then right and tried to grasp every glimpse of this Institute. After the counselling formalities, I was assigned Hall 13‚Äîthe newest hostel in IITK.",
      "For the first time in my life, I would be living in a hostel setting. I was excited but also very nervous, and gradually my emotions started to overwhelm me.¬† With so many unknown students around me from all over India, I began to feel like a small drop in a big, wide ocean. On the very 3rdnight in my hostel, I went to the bathroom and cried! Gradually,¬† as I started making friends and interacting with some of my classmates, things started to get better, much better!",
      "Being a spiritual person, I was delighted to join a church group inside the campus. Meanwhile, my academic classes started, and I was amazed to see how cool and friendly the IIT professors were. Learning was actually fun here! One of my most treasured moments was performing my self-composed poetry in the Chemistry department Freshers. After the program, all the professors and students had dinner together and slowly but surely, IIT Kanpur had become my ‚ÄúHome away from Home.‚Äù",
      "But just as everything was going smooth, the mid-semester exams arrived! One of the academically challenging things about IITs is that you have the brightest students from all across India in one place. Despite all the stress and pressure, it was a joy to study all night with my friends in the New Core Lab (NCL). And how much should I praise the Student Lounge? Such comfortable chairs and sofas and air conditioning ‚Äì it was my most preferred place to study. All of us were very serious about the exams since it was the first time that we were going to give exams in an IIT. In contrast, now in our last semester, hardly anyone even remembers the exam dates!",
      "The much-awaited mid-semester break finally kicked in, and my family visited me on the campus. They stayed in the guest room, and after a few days, we all went to visit Lucknow. It was a very special moment for me since they were very proud of me for studying at a top institute of the country.",
      "The second part of the semester started, and this time I was very motivated and focused on improving my grades. I stopped participating in extracurricular activities and put a lot of pressure on myself. Unfortunately, this process backfired! Despite studying more, I ended up getting lower grades than my mid-semester exams.",
      "I learnt a crucial lesson then‚Äì Play it to your own strength. In a game of chess, you do not attack the opponent from the side you are weaker in, but rather from the side where you are stronger. Similarly, in life, you should not blindly follow the crowd. Instead, you should focus on the areas where you are strong. I halted my extracurriculars and tried to copy others‚Äô study routines, but to my own dismay.",
      "I engaged in an exciting activity during the mid-semester break and also after the end-semester exams. I interviewed 5-6 of my 1st year B.tech friends in Hall 13 about their journey to IIT and how IITK was treating them. And truly, this activity was a delight to my soul! To get to hear their struggles and hardships and their resilience in overcoming them was highly inspiring.",
      "In my 2ndsemester, I had a new roommate, and we became very good friends. When you have a roommate who encourages you every now and then, you are bound to have a good semester.¬† That‚Äôs precisely what happened! I excelled both in my academics and extracurriculars. I was quick to involve myself in a Christmas Program organized on campus, where I had the privilege of playing the role of Jesus in a small skit. Everything was well organized this semester. I was able to manage my academics, and whenever I used to get some free time, I involved myself in some sort of social work or other activities. There was only one big challenge in this month of January‚Äîthe chilling cold!",
      "Being from Kolkata, I had hardly experienced temperatures below 10¬∞C, but here it went as low as 0¬∞C. We scarcely took proper baths during those days! Once, I woke up, and everything that I touched was freezing cold! Initially, it was very tough but slowly and steadily, I adapted to it. In this 2ndsemester, I did play it to my own strength! I broke my habit of studying late at night. Instead, I started my day early and was also involved in extra-curriculars. All in all, I was in a great mental space. As a matter of fact, I was so confident about my preparation that I left for my hometown to attend my previous college reunion function and give my family a surprise!",
      "Upon my return to campus, the mid-semester break commenced which eventually got extended by two weeks, due to the pandemic. And in those 2 weeks, I really lived the campus life! I went on a mission to explore every corner of the campus and do every unique activity possible. From entering the girls‚Äô hostel to roaming inside the SBRA (family quarters), from playing tennis for the first time in my life to performing in the OAT in front of my best friend, those 2 weeks were lit! We were neither worried about our exams nor our career, but truly living the IIT life! Sadly, every good thing comes to an end, and because of the virus, we were eventually told to go back home. Who knew that the next time we would meet each other would be after one long year!",
      "During the lockdown, it became a challenge to get back to my rhythm. Nevertheless, I got myself involved in some debating competitions and even managed to get some prizes. I participated in a plethora of chess competitions as well. I also had the privilege of organizing our Chemistry department Freshers‚Äô Party online. It was motivating to see my juniors with such fresh energy, passion and curiosity to know about the ‚ÄúPrestigious IIT life‚Äù! I really hope they get to be on campus soon.",
      "One of my prized memories of the lockdown is that I created a small counselling group based on the Biblical motto ‚Äì ‚ÄúEncourage one another and build each other up.‚Äù Around 12 to 14 of my friends used to meet over zoom once every fortnight and share our stories about all the good and positive things that were happening around us. The best part about this group was that apart from sharing stories, the students were also willing to listen to what others had to say. Finally, just before the lockdown ended, we organized a Christmas and New Year Program based on the theme ‚ÄúRat Race Vs Your Race‚Äù which was attended by 45 of my friends from various departments, across UGs and PGs. Even though our semester had shifted online, I must thank the professors and the institute for listening to the concerns and taking care of the students.",
      "We were called back on campus on 6thMarch 2021, about a year after we left! With inexpressible joy, I again entered the glorious gates of IIT Kanpur! After our mandatory 1-week quarantine, we were let loose! I still remember the fresh breeze that was blowing against my face as I cycled around the campus, the sweet scent of the early mornings, the soul-satisfying sight of the colourful flowers around the campus, and waking up to the squawk of peacocks ‚Äì it felt like I had returned to a placewhere I truly belong. A good friend of mine said‚Äì ‚ÄúIIT Kanpur is not just a place, it is an emotion.‚Äù",
      "The last semester was mainly spent in research work. I was very fortunate to have been allowed to use 2 microscopes which cost around 80 lakhs each! The lab seniors were super friendly. They not only help you in your subject but also in every sphere of life!¬† Obviously, the lab parties were some of my best memories. I remember when we went to CCD along with our supervisor, and we just ordered and ate as much as we could! During the scorching heat of April, my only aim was to get to the labs as soon as possible so that I can sit in the AC and relax. And there would be so much peace! But, as I already said previously ‚Äì Good things don‚Äôt last long in this world, and so it was, coronavirus was back again. We were given a hint that the campus might be shut down again.",
      "However, before things closed down again, I decided to live the IIT life for the last time! We visited the Flight Lab and took some ‚Äúout of the world‚Äù pictures with the planes. We also took some crazy high jump photos on the runway! Just before the mail came asking us to leave, I remember gathering with some of my friends late at night and sharing some of the memories we made in IITK. Such a heartfelt moment it was! And of course, we did two things before leaving‚Äîone, the mandatory group photo and two, bought some IITK souvenirs from the Outreach Center. My favorite thing about IITK would be that I got to make friends with students from almost every state of India. My favourite daily activity would always be to have food together with these precious friends in our mess. One thing that I learnt from IITK is that everyone is beautiful in their own way. So, if you are different, never think that you are ‚Äúweird‚Äù; it is just that you are a ‚Äúunique‚Äù person!¬† As I leave IITK, I want to end with this small poem that I wrote",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT-K.",
      "One day, you‚Äôll leave this world behind",
      "So, live a life you will remember",
      "My father told me when I was just a child ‚Äî",
      "These are the nights that never die.",
      "College time is the most valuable time in one‚Äôs life. These years lead you towards the next phase of your life. These years help you decide your future ‚Äî whether you will go for a job or do a start-up or go for further studies. As crucial as these years are for your career, these years are also the years where you get the opportunity to enjoy life and live it to the fullest. These years play a vital role in helping you to find your purpose in life. There are many ups and downs in college life ‚Äî a lot of happy and sad moments, and it‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt have to be strong all the time; you‚Äôre not a diwar made of ambuja cement. The way you deal with challenging situations defines your character ‚Äî helps you to find the inner you. It assists in determining what kind of person you indeed are.",
      "Many people waste these years pretending what they genuinely aren‚Äôt. This might make them happy to have a different image of theirs in people‚Äôs eyes. However, by doing so, they further stray from their true self. Your looks or how pretty you are, that‚Äôs all great but what matters is your work ethics, how you pick yourself up when you fall, how you deal with your trauma and issues, and how you talk with yourself.",
      "Of all the people on the planet, you talk to yourself the most, make sure you are saying the right thing.",
      "I also faced many issues in my college years but facing and dealing with those issues made me strong. I love to explore things a lot because you miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take. I tried many things in my first year ‚Äî Drams, Volleyball, AUV, Robotics club, Electronics club, and much more. It was fun as well as exhaustive but a good kinda exhaustive. Doing something most of the time gave me a dopamine rush. However, in the end, I had to narrow down my choices a bit. I chose AUV and the Robotics club. I stayed with these two for the rest of my college life. When you see a model of yours that you spent days learning and implementing, finally start working ‚Äî the feeling you experience at that time can not be defined in words. I enjoyed working with the AUV team, which helped me develop the skill set required to be a leader and a team player.",
      "Had I got a chance to go back in time and change anything, I would not take that chance. I do not want any episode of my college life to change or not happen. These episodes are responsible for making me the person I am. I‚Äôve enjoyed every single moment in these four years that I spent on campus.",
      "Everyone is unique, and that‚Äôs their speciality. I‚Äôve spent many days comparing myself with others to realise that we all are different ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have what others have. Others don‚Äôt have what I have. Their way of approaching a problem is different from mine, which makes both of the ways unique.",
      "If you are comparing your life or your creativity to someone else, you are insulting yourself.",
      "I met many different people on campus. Few stayed in my life, and with a few, I‚Äôm not in touch anymore. I might suffer from memory loss, but I remember every incident that involved people I met on campus. I believe everyone comes into your life for a reason. They come to play a particular role and teach you specific things, then leave as soon as their part is done. However, the most important lesson that I learned from this is that the day you finally let go of the person you‚Äôve been pointlessly holding onto is the day your life gets a whole lot better.",
      "After all, your mental health is your biggest asset, like Mahindra Scorpio and some people are like Rohit Shetty ‚Äî be aware of them.",
      "It was in college only where I found the closest friends of mine. It is important to hold on to people who were always there for you in your ups and downs, who never left your side in your hard times, and who constantly criticised you when you were wrong. Also, people are scared to say stuff, and I‚Äôm not ‚Äî that‚Äôs the reason why I only have five friends!! xD",
      "College time is a beautiful time that would never return in your life. So, at last, I will only say that one should stop worrying about the future and live in the present ‚Äî enjoy every fight, remember every painful event, memorise every happy moment, and most important ‚Äì learn something from every incident.",
      "I just want to say ‚ÄîDream big, do not take a break. Keep working hard. It‚Äôs okay if someone is laughing at you or if someone is pulling your leg. Keep working hard. Accept and embrace all experiences. Keep looking at the sky and reach your goals. No matter what anyone else says because if you can‚Äôt protect yourself or dream for yourself, nobody else can!",

      "Waking up at 6 on weekdays and rushing to the sports grounds for the early morning PE101 classes, the introduction to the Games and Sports facilities at IIT Kanpur is one of the most prominent talking points in the usual offline semester. Since its inception, IITK has been an acclaimed institute for its wide-ranging sports facilities and because of the inculcation of the culture of participating in various sporting events for the students. The vast plethora of games and sports played on campus encompasses almost every outdoor and indoor game played across the globe.",
      "One of the important aspects of IITK that the freshers have missed out on in the online semester is the PE101 course. A subtle feature of the PE101 course was the Compulsory Physical Activity ‚Äî CPA. With trials for different sports in the first week, students join a sport and pursue the same for their first year. The advent of the CPA over the years at IITK saw a blooming sporting culture, with students joining sports as inexperienced freshers and graduating from the institute as one of the most accomplished sportspersons the campus has ever witnessed.",
      "The Main Sports Stadium, home to the cricket ground and the athletics stadiums is the first place where the incoming students realize the scale of the sporting facilities at IITK. The ground, home to one of the finest facilities for cricket, has seen the stands filled with crowds and a number of nail-biting finishes. The stadium also witnesses the thrill of the athletics events with students participating in running, throwing, and jumping events. The Main Sports Stadium is also home to the taekwondo maestros practicing their skills and with classes for every member of the campus community.",
      "Adjacent to the main stadium is the basketball, volleyball and tennis courts. With crowds rushing to the stands and cheering for their teams, and chanting anthems and slogans, the atmosphere in the courts is something that has brought the sense of belonging to IITK to numerous students. Accompanying the basketball and volleyball courts is the Old Student Activity Centre (Old SAC). The old-school environment at the Old SAC takes you to the times which laid the foundation of the Games and Sports facilities at IITK. Even though the Old SAC has evolved several-fold over the years, the place gives you a first-hand experience of how seriously sports are taken at IITK. Home to the gym and the weightlifting room, the sanctum also hosts the Squash and Badminton courts. With the skating rink right next to the Old SAC, the sporting facilities at the center of the campus span numerous sporting activities and are bound to be the favourite place on campus for several students.",
      "While a number of sports are played out in the open sun, many are played under a roof with the most magnificent of facilities. Host to the wooden basketball court, state-of-the-art badminton courts, and a number of table tennis courts as well, the New SAC is a marvel of the sporting culture at IITK. Also, the New SAC is home to an air-conditioned gym! The New SAC is also the place that has the wall climbing facility at IITK!",
      "Walking out of the New SAC, one is often left gawking at the massive hockey and football grounds at IITK. Witnessing several competitive games, the grounds have grown to become the home to the institute‚Äôs budding sportspersons. Any account of the sporting facilities at IITK would be incomplete without the Olympic-size swimming pool and water sports being played at the pool, such as water polo. The swimming facilities at IITK have been crucial in bringing laurels to IITK in inter-college and national sporting events.",
      "Apart from all the above facilities, the Games and Sports¬† Council also act as an umbrella to numerous societies and clubs, including the chess club, the boxing club, the shooting club, the bicycling society, and the card and board games society. With the aim of helping students explore their interests and develop new hobbies, these clubs organize various events and workshops throughout the year and encourage the campus community to take part in the same.",
      "The Games and Sports Council is one of the integral elements of IITK. From providing the students each and every facility to pursue their sporting interest to making the institute proud with their performances in the Inter IITs and other events, the council plays a pivotal role in keeping up the sporting culture on campus. The council ensures that all the sports have coaches to help students refine their technique, and the students are never short of opportunities to excel in the sport of their preference. Promoting the sports spirit and inculcating the culture of being healthy and fit, GnS is the reason that every student gets the opportunity to play and express themself on the playground.",

It is hence an excellent opportunity to learn and explore one‚Äôs interests in specific cultural fields.",

If not, it can at least try to give you a kaleidoscopic view of what seems to be absolute monochromic and dull? After all, these years are all about exploring, learning, and living!",

      "‚ÄúMy first interaction with SnT came during SnT foyer in orientation. Several cool projects on display like rovers and even a race car, and I quickly decided to attend all the introductory sessions.

      "Vox Populi brings to you the third edition of the series Campus Blueprints: The journey of Raktarpan. We interviewed¬†one of the initial members of Raktarpan, Shubham Prakash and the present overall coordinator of Community Welfare Cell, Piyush Patel, to bring to you an overview of Raktarpan and how the stimulation of blood donation was able to evolve over the years and show you a glimpse of how Raktarpan is constantly working as a blockade between a person‚Äôs life and death. Read on to explore more of its history.",
      "Raktarpan: Activities and reach",
      "Shubham mentions that Raktarpan‚Äôs activities can be seen through the lens of three streams. The first domain is handling and resolving the demands they receive through many calls from around Kanpur city. The second domain is spreading awareness among individuals through seminars and dance events. The third important domain is to conduct blood donation camps. Other than this, they also focused on outreach as they wanted the name of Raktarpan to be spread among different hospitals.",
      "In the pre-pandemic times, Raktarpan organized blood donation camps in every hall. It yielded around 1000-1200 donations in a year. They also conducted awareness sessions, which broke the myths on the risks of blood donation. Online posters and articles were released for campus janta.",
      "When directly contacted by anyone in need of blood, Raktarpan managed to make arrangements from the blood banks. However, in some cases, the requirement was of a rare blood group, and mails had to be sent to the entire campus community. The team comprises around 30 volunteers and has handled more than 600 requests in a year. Almost all the requests are catered on time. With such work efficiency, Raktarpan has saved uncountable lives while also managing to educate people about the safe and simple process of donating for a good cause.",
      "But, most of the work undertaken was restricted to the offline mode, and the online conduction was sure to fetch no good results when it came to events. The team has currently advanced on conducting competitions on making creative memes, writing articles. It has created ways to take interviews to help the prolonged dormancy and replenish the activities even in such hard times!",
      "Early struggles",
      "Piyush mentions that, about four years ago, all the volunteers of Raktarpan were new with no whatsoever practice and little awareness about the kind of work to be done. Some of them even had to handle around 150 donations daily, which meant volunteers hardly got the free time.",
      "The major problem that Raktarpan faced in the early days was funds. Initially, Raktarpan was not a club but a part of NSS and their annual budget was around 5 thousand rupees, making the situation harder for them. This was resolved by taking Raktarpan into gymkhana as an individual club. If some bigger events were lined up, they tried getting sponsorship from SBI IITK. One of the other challenges which came was the stigma of the Health centre and authorities. They had to make sure that at least a doctor must be present in every blood donation camp. As the initial team was small, managing the database of regular donors and asking them for their serving in Raktarpan was a challenging task.",
      "Motivation to join Raktarpan",
      "Before coming to the campus, Shubham didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be working for Raktarpan. What urged him to join and work for Raktarpan was his wing mate‚Äôs experience with blood donation and how he was treated so well by the blood recipient and his family, it created a great sense of warmth inside him. At that point, he knew he had to work for this organization.",
      "Piyush went with a mindset of exploring every club out there as every fresher does. After coming to campus, he tried different genres and finally landed in Raktarpan in February 2018, and since then, he has been an integral part of it.",
      "Organization of Blood donation camps",
      "Raktarpan arranges around 20 camps a year, i.e., two every month, on campus and outside. The volunteers adhere to managing the entire non-medical arena. The team works on the logistics of facilitating proper management while at the same time, also monitors and ensures the safety of the donors.",
      "Raktarpan has collaborated with BloodConnect Foundation, a student-run NGO fostering the same cause. Thereby, camps are organized in unison, where both groups contribute equally.",
      "In early 2015, when Shubham joined the Raktarpan, the team was very small, making it hard for them to conduct blood donation camps regularly. They usually conduct three camps in his initial period of joining, but by the end of Shubham‚Äôs graduation, Raktarpan was conducting around seven blood donation camps. Instead of organizing camps in the yoga hall, they shifted it to the respective halls. It turned out to be a fruitful process that resulted in a considerable amount of blood collection.",
      "Response from the campus community",
      "Talking about volunteers, Raktarpan has a considerable number of enthusiastic students willing to work for it. This number escalates amongst the PGs, who are adamant about lending help whenever needed. Following this, the team amasses up to 100 PG donations in any camp organized, while the same number dips down to 10 when it comes to UG hostels.",
      "Shubham mentions that people are very much interested in donating blood but not so much when it comes to volunteering to conduct a blood donation camp or for an awareness session.",
      "Connectivity of Raktarpan outside the campus",
      "Outside the campus, there are many collaborations with Raktarpan, one of them being BloodConnect. It works in Kanpur city, and whenever there‚Äôs a camp outside the campus, they are the one being approached. Many volunteers in Raktarpan are part of NGOs, which helps in the smooth running of such works. The next is a media collaboration with Amar Ujala, which helps advertise their work by covering them in their newspaper. There are other NGOs, too, like the Robinhood army, which have mutual volunteers with Raktarpan.",
      "Evolution of Raktarpan",
      "Shubham marks that Raktarpan has evolved, and is heading in the right direction. The number of people involved and the reach has increased. Raktarpan can now help more helpline cases and conduct a higher number of camps in Kanpur than they did before. According to Shubham, what Rakatarpan needs right now is more support from the students especially during the COVID lockdown.",
      "According to Piyush, Raktarpan has evolved a lot in the last couple of years. Before every camp, they have to approach campus janta for blood donation, but now people are clued-up about this thing and come by themselves in blood donation camp. When Piyush joined the club, Raktarpan‚Äôs work was more restricted to the campus, but as time passed, collaboration expanded to the organization like Amar Ujala, Robinhood army, etc. Also, awards from the Chief Medical Officer of Kanpur and appreciation from the state government added feathers to the Raktarpan‚Äôs cap.",
      "Memorable experiences",
      "Piyush recalls that he volunteered for the city-level works of the NGO BloodConnect for around 4-5 months in Kanpur city. Also, he travelled to places like Amritsar, Mumbai, and Kolkata for the All-India level NGO meets, concluding that Raktarpan is a good opportunity to gain exposure and meet amazing people.",
      "Shubham was the helpline manager in the summer after his 1st year. One day, while working, a request for an AB negative blood group came his way, and in his batch, only five students had the same blood group, out of which only two were present on campus. So, Shubham talked to one of them, gave out his side of the argument. He even went on to say that if they didn‚Äôt donate their blood, the patient would be in life-threatening conditions!",
      "But thankfully, Shubham‚Äôs series of rational and irrational arguments finally convinced one of the two people to donate their blood. The person who did go to donate, after coming back, said that he felt an immense sense of satisfaction and that the patient‚Äôs family reaction was also very supportive, kind, and thankful. After that experience, he started donating blood regularly. This is an experience Shubham feels grateful for because due to his persistent requests, another person decided to donate blood and has now become a regular donor!",
      "Necessary changes that need to be made in Raktarpan",
      "It takes people time to understand how to conduct blood donation camps efficiently. If such camps are not publicized adequately, then people don‚Äôt show up. Thus, every time a new team organizes a blood donation camp, fewer people turn up. Whereas an experienced team conducts more efficient blood donation camps. Thus, Shubham suggests Rakatarpan should keep volunteers motivated to be involved for longer periods.",
      "Another issue that Raktarpan faces is the selection of blood banks and consistently supplying them blood. For instance, even if they collect 500 units of blood in a single camp, it must be realized that blood is not used over a day; it is a long process and will be utilized over a year! So, Piyush advises that instead of conducting donation camps with larger goals, one can conduct small-scale blood donation camps regularly to say different halls of residences.",
      "Message to the future members of Raktarpan",
      "Shubham:Blood donation is a great thing to do, but if you can create a good experience for the people who do donate blood, that is what will last a long way.¬†So one must make sure the right set of people come to you, and you can help them get a good experience. This will urge those people to attend more blood donation camps, and help decrease the blood shortage and bring the situation down to a better place.",
      "Piyush:You should not think of community service as an activity that doesn‚Äôt provide growth opportunities. For me, BloodConnect was just the start of the many opportunities and encouraged me to work further. This should not be a burden and just another point on your CV. The feeling should come from within.",

      "Though the necessity of extracurricular activities is impossible to be undermined in college life, the biggest factor governing the career of an individual is the academic opportunities and professional endeavors one utilizes during this period. And the Academics and Career (AnC) Council makes sure students don‚Äôt miss upon all these opportunities one can avail during their undergraduate and postgraduate years.",
      "As the name suggests, AnC aims to foster all needs pertaining to academics and research for the student community. The council comprises various wings including UG/PG Academics Wing, Research Wing, International Relations Wing, and Career Development Wing which together thrive to fulfill all academics and research-related needs of the students.",
      "So how do these wings specialize individually and what do they have in store for Y20? Here it goes:",
      "UG/PG academics: It pertains to all academic matters, working on academic curriculum and catering to related doubts for both the UG and PG students. It holds academic and departmental orientations to acquaint students in the respective avenues. The wing works in tandem with SUGC/SPGC (Senate Under/Post-Graduate Committee) and DUGC/DPGC (Departmental Under/Post-Graduate Committee) nominees of the Senate to respective committees in order to ensure smooth working. Also, the wing keeps in touch with the DoAA (Dean of Academic Affairs) for academic purposes and reforms, sort issues and doubts.",
      "For Y20:Will provide info about the courses offered, how can they choose their courses later on, and learn from the feedback of seniors. Also, there would be department mentors who would act as a communication point of view to efficiently plan their template and judiciously approach their respective departments, and hold departmental orientations too.",
      "Research wing: Interested in research activities and internships? This wing caters to all the research activities on campus, plus provides options of research through off-campus opportunities, internships and informs of all the possible scholarship opportunities.",
      "Student Research Convention(SRC):¬†SRC aims to foster student-based research and create a platform for young researchers to meet and exchange ideas. It organizes competitions, projects options, and helps students connect with professionals in the industry to get more insights on the field.",
      "To generate the necessary intellectual and physical infrastructure for further research, the institute created the Dean of Research & Development position(DoRD). The Technopark in IITK serves as a vibrant research and innovation ecosystem for academicians, industrialists, and entrepreneurs to connect, collaborate and create highly advanced and innovative technology solutions addressing current and future challenges of the society. Further information can be found in the below website:",
      "https://www.iitk.ac.in/dord/",
      "For Y20:SRC will be open for their participation. Professors will take the session and spread awareness on relevant topics. There would be a UG Research handbook detailing them of all necessary and relevant information, including the availability of scholarship options.",
      "International relations wing: Being the one-stop to stepping a foot overseas, The International Relations(IR) wing is a student organization dedicated to work in close association with the Dean, International Relations(DoIR) and the Office of International Relations(OIR), IIT Kanpur to improve collaborations of the Institute and its foreign counterparts. It also acts as a complementary link between the student community and the office.",
      "It works in tandem with offices of international institutes and universities, manages foreign exchange programs, research and internship options abroad. Also, it covers the prospects of semester exchange programs with several reputed universities overseas, which can serve as a wonderful learning experience for students!",
      "More information could be found at:https://home.iitk.ac.in/~smohit/cs300A/campus-wiki/2A.html",
      "Recently there was a language event from Japan and the IR wing was responsible for organizing it.",
      "The prospect of applying to an international graduate school is exciting as well as daunting. As the application procedure itself takes up considerable time and effort, and relevant preparation and the aftermath are equally important, the AnC initiated GRAD (Graduate Research Application Directory) which is a compilation of experiences and methodologies of the recent alumni who went through a similar journey and hurdles and ultimately overcame them in favor of their application. It can be accessed below:",
      "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oeSLXFXlEEI8zctiDi3vh6Hc9yvrp65I/view?usp=drivesdk",
      "For Y20:A handbook is being prepared which would guide them to the opportunities overseas.",
      "It would inform about PhD applications, higher studies opportunities, increasing MoUs, etc. For example, there‚Äôs a body called IAESTE which facilitates international opportunities like internships and research abroad.",
      "Career Development Wing: For the much-awaited season of interns and placements, students need to have a really good preparation to ensure a smooth pathway in the selection process. Enter the Career Development Wing, which guides the various career paths like options in core and non-core sectors. It conducts various workshops and sessions in acquainting them about the system, and also to improve soft skills during placements and internships. Here experts in industries are allotted as mentors, mock interviews are conducted to familiarize the students with the real scenario. Career Counselling is done to resolve dilemmas and to find an interest in a particular career path. To add more, there are specialized preparation manuals for different fields, for example of quant preparation, consultancy preparation, even for CAT preparation!",
      "For Y20:Handbooks are being created where things to explore in their departments are included so that they can make a plan for their future. Newsletters, blogs, and handbooks are made available to help students in exploring different career options.",
      "To recount the experiences of seniors and make it more relatable, there are several blogs on the original website, where seniors have shared important tips and tricks. And there are several individual blogs for various fields: starting from internship experience to placements fundae and even research abroad. There are several sessions organized for important events like branch change, choosing a particular OE/DE/ESO where students can clear their doubts from the council members who were in a similar situation before, and several more.",
      "And to keep in touch with the latest trends and make sure students aren‚Äôt lagging behind with their peers from other institutes, the AnC holds sessions for various important and beneficial courses like Machine Learning, introduction to Autodesk, approaches to file patents, etc.",
      "The AnC opens recruitment for the students from their 2nd year as secretaries, where they assist the managers of their respective wings in the works pertaining to the council. The General Secretary is responsible for overseeing the work of the council acting as an interface between the Institute policymakers and the students on all important matters.",

      "Gorank Dudeja had joined IIT Kanpur in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering as a student of the Y11 batch. However, after two years of struggle, he decided to change his major to B.S in Maths and also did a minor in IME. He graduated in the year 2016. If any disabled student wants to reach out to him, his email address is gorankd1993@gmail.com",
      "A little background on his disability:He is 100% hearing impaired but not speech impaired. He engages in day-to-day conversations by using lip reading techniques to understand what others are speaking. He wears digital hearing aids that amplify loud sounds like horns of vehicles and things like that. Gorank tells us how lip reading is not an exact science; it is more of an instinct and how it takes years to master fluency in reading lips in any one language. He had grown up talking to people in Hindi- so he was fluent in reading Hindi words on people‚Äôs lips. But, in IITK, most professors and TAs spoke in English, which was a problem for him throughout his stay on campus and continues to be even today. The only way to communicate clearly with a deaf person is sign language, which, unfortunately, not many people know.",
      "Vox Populi got in touch with him to know his journey at IITK and how he faced his struggles. Read on to learn more about him-",
      "Q. What are some of the academic challenges which you encountered in college, and how did you cope with them?",
      "At IIT Kanpur, the lecture halls are quite large. Before college, I had never been to such large halls, so it was a new experience for me, even more so than normal people. Even if one sits on the first bench, the professors aren‚Äôt close enough for their lips to be discernible. So, I could never make out anything of what the professors used to say in the class. To cope with this issue, I used to note down everything the professor used to write on the board and whatever students sitting next to me wrote in their notebooks. Further, I used to study the reference books in the library and match them with the notes I had made in the class, to understand the lectures‚Äô topics. I had to do this for every lecture I attended, every day. Can you imagine the effort it must have taken me to understand what was being taught in the class? This used to take up so much of my time, which, as you know, we never had enough. In some of the courses, our library didn‚Äôt have the reference books, and I couldn‚Äôt afford those costly books, so I had to drop most such courses. As a result of this, among other struggles, it took me five years to complete the course, which was smoothly done in 4 years by my peers.",
      "Q. How did your physical disability affect your ability to communicate with your peers? What bearings did it have on your social circle?",
      "Effective communication between two people always requires two things ‚Äì the ability to hear and speak in a common language. I never struggled with the latter, but of course, I didn‚Äôt have the means for the former. I had a lot of friends in the first semester because everything was new then. Everyone was fixated on the fact that they had cracked JEE with amazing All India Ranks and got admitted to the best college in India. However, as time progressed, my CPI started to drop. As semesters went by, many people stopped being friends with me or even being nice to me. They thought that I was mentally retarded when they had to repeat the same sentence twice or even thrice to get me to understand what they were talking about.",
      "But life wasn‚Äôt all that bad. There were four hostel mates and great friends who stood by me for all those years. We all helped each other with academics, life problems, friendships, relationships and whatnot. No man can be an island, right? I am glad I wasn‚Äôt wholly an island. Otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt have made all those good memories with those people to cherish now.",
      "Q. Was some form of help provided by the administration to facilitate your stay at IITK? How effective and useful did you find it?",
      "No, I didn‚Äôt receive any special assistance from the administration. In every course I took, I used to tell my professors and the TAs in the first week itself, that I was deaf. All of them assured me that I could approach them anytime for doubt clearing sessions or whenever I needed any academic help. But that‚Äôs the thing, you know? Like I explained above, I wasn‚Äôt fluent in lipreading English words, so after a time, I just stopped approaching them for help and started doing everything myself.",
      "Q. What kind of support systems exist at IITK to accommodate People with Disabilities? What more do you think could be done to improve this?",
      "Every disability has its own set of limitations, which only the disabled person can realize fully. So, I can speak only for deafness here. I can‚Äôt say for the disabled community as a whole, for one simple reason ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know how they feel and exactly what problems they encounter in their daily life.",
      "I want to tell you a short story. I had approached the DoAA at the time to speak to him about my disability and my problems, hoping that maybe IITK had some special classes or accommodations for people like me. To my surprise, he told me that during his entire tenure in the institute, he hadn‚Äôt come across a single 100% deaf person who got admitted to the institute. He praised me for my achievement that despite having a significant disability, I could get admission in that institute. He asked me to contact him if I ever needed any help. He had advised me to take some online MOOCs, where videos have subtitles. Like Coursera, MIT Courseware, and Udacity, a few websites helped me in some of the IITK courses. But during that conversation with the DOAA, I had understood that I was alone in this and I would have to depend on only myself if I want to cope with the institute‚Äôs fast-paced environment.",
      "I believe that IITK, which is considered to be one of the best institutes in our country, should have some accommodations for people with all types of disabilities, irrespective of whether they have encountered such people before or not.",
      "For deaf people, sign language is the easiest way for professors to engage with those deaf students. There should be a teacher on the campus who knows sign language or a signer, for that matter. I understand that budget issues might not allow the institute to hire such teachers for every class, but we can always develop innovative alternatives, right? I can think of two ways to do this- either the institute can hire one such teacher for deaf students, or there can be some arrangement for the deaf student to hire someone to translate the lectures to them- and the administration could reimburse the cost for the same- up to a limit, of course. Like the DOAA had said, there were not many deaf people enrolling in IITK, so I don‚Äôt think it would cost the administration much to implement this. If any such program is ever implemented in our institute, I would love to donate to that program, and I believe many other alumni will also.",
      "Q. What do you think the campus community should know about interacting with People with Disabilities to make it more accommodating for everyone?",
      "There should be a division inside Gymkhana or even Counselling Service, solely and exclusively for only disabled people, voted by only disabled people, and made up of only disabled people. That group should work for all the disabled people on the campus, help them assimilate in the campus, take advice, academic or otherwise, or anything else, and encourage them to engage in debates, campus elections, and everything. There may even be initiatives towards financial help for disabled students. Further, there should be a directory listing all disabled alumni of our esteemed institute, so that future disabled students can approach them on email or calls anytime. I would love to see that happen.",
      "Q. Were you interested in or had participated in some clubs, cells? What were your experiences with the peer groups there and your involvement in the activities?",
      "Yes, I had tried my hand in different clubs. I did a short stint in the Robotics Club and developed a small robotic car model with five other people. I tried one Dance Club class and even performed on a Punjabi song in a hall function, but that didn‚Äôt work out as deafness and dance don‚Äôt go too well together. My uncle has a professional photo studio, and I wanted to help him expand his business- so I tried out some photography club lectures as well. I tried all these clubs only in my first year because at the end of that, my CPI had deteriorated a lot, and I always felt guilty whenever I wanted to try a club. I would always think that I should be studying to improve my CPI; otherwise, my placement chances are nil. So, I then stopped participating much and focussed on my studies only.",
      "Q. There would be several amongst us living through the unique experience of being PwD. What advice would you want to give them?",
      "I would advise people with disabilities to approach similar seniors. Ask people like you how they coped up with the things you‚Äôre struggling in. See, this is where Gymkhana‚Äôs body or disabled alumni directory would be helpful to them, which I talked about in a previous question. If such a Gymkhana body came into existence in the future, disabled people would know where to go and whom to ask for any advice. When I was in IITK, I didn‚Äôt even know that there was no other deaf person on the campus- I came to know only when the DoAA told me.",
      "My advice to them ‚Äì Never think of yourself as alone in this whole thing. No matter how stupid it feels at that moment, ask your professors whatever doubts you may have. But most of all, enjoy yourself. I didn‚Äôt enjoy my college time because every time I tried to enjoy anything, I would feel guilty that I am not studying to improve my CPI and wasting my father‚Äôs money. My father had also taken a loan to pay my tuition fees, and I felt like that was my burden to bear. So, don‚Äôt worry about the future. I used to worry too much, in vain, because my life is going well now.¬† I have an amazing job and an amazing support system in my family and friends.¬† It all works out in the end, believe me on that. You will have many opportunities in the future- be it landing a job or anything else. But, this college time will never return.",
      "Q. Is there anything else you want to tell our readers?",
      "When I started having problems with understanding lectures in the first semester itself, I sought help from my hostel mates. But no one had enough time to hold my hand through every topic in every subject, right? As time went by, I stopped asking for help altogether. That was my mistake. I thought that they should help me and I was wrong about that. Instead, now I believe that I should have found another disabled person whose disability would have complemented mine. Like, for example, suppose I could have made a deal with an orthopedically handicapped student that I would drop him to and fro from the lecture halls to his hostel on cycle, and he can help me out with the lectures. Stuff like that, you know? Instead, I went at it alone, and I sort of, barely scraped by, in almost every course. So, that‚Äôs what I want to tell everyone ‚Äì never think of yourself as alone. Help is there. You just have to extend your hand and ask for it.",
      "Finally, through your column, I would like to tell any future deaf students or any other disabled students of IITK that they could always reach out to me at my email gorankd1993@gmail.com if they need any advice or help from me. Thank you!",

      "Academics are one of the most important aspects of a student‚Äôs life at IIT Kanpur. Here, we will try to explain the structure of the academic curriculum of IITK briefly (however complex it may have seemed :P). After that, we shall take a quick peek at the overall academic environment, and end by drawing a parallel between an offline lecture in L20 and a Zoom class. So without wasting any time let‚Äôs dive into the third lecture of IITK101",
      "Template",
      "The academic structure for every program is dictated by a departmental template. The template lists down the courses to be done in a semester-wise fashion, such that the minimum graduation requirements for the concerned degree are met. The template also considers the prerequisites of different courses, and the courses are scheduled accordingly. But the template is not binding on the students, and they have the freedom to schedule courses according to their own volition. Detailed guidelines regarding course templates can be found on the DoAA website.[1]",
      "Types of courses",
      "Each UG program requires the students to complete minimum credits from different sets of courses. Different categories are listed and summarized below:",
      "1.Institute Core (IC) Courses:¬† The IC courses are common and compulsory for all the UG students. These courses cover the fundamentals of various topics, ranging from basic sciences such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, to core engineering subjects such as manufacturing, electronics, and computing. The IC courses populate the 1st and 2nd-year template arrangements.",
      "2.Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) Courses: The minimum graduation requirements for UG students include a total of 5 courses (further classified into 2 Level-1 courses and 3 Level-2 courses) from a basket of courses from the discipline of Humanities and Social Sciences.¬†A natural question that arises is ‚ÄúWhy HSS courses in a technology institute?‚Äù. While engineering and science courses help us gain better insights into the world‚Äôs technological and scientific aspects, HSS courses complement this learning by focusing on various social, cultural, and moral issues. Apart from developing one‚Äôs critical thinking ability, these courses also broaden one‚Äôs perspective of the world and life in general. Ultimately, these courses contribute towards sensitizing students and helping them become better human beings.",
      "3.Department Compulsory (DC) Courses: As the name indicates, these DC are mandatory for students belonging to a specific department. The courses aim to engulf the essential topics related to the department. Many DC courses also form prerequisites for other departmental courses.",
      "4.Department Elective (DE) Courses: Students have the option to choose from a wide array of courses from their parent discipline, which are offered as DE courses. DE courses are typically present from 5th-sem onwards in most departmental templates. The minimum credit requirement for DE courses varies across programs.",
      "5.Open Elective (OE) Courses: All UG students are required to complete around 54 credits, which translates to roughly 6 courses (for some departments, it is 63 credits/7 courses), as Open Electives. These are courses that students may take from any department/program in the Institute. OEs offer students an opportunity to explore diverse topics beyond their parent discipline. These courses are one of the significant aspects that provide the IITK Academic curriculum the flexibility it is renowned for.",
      "6.(Engineering) Science Options (ESOs/SOs): ESO/SO courses are electives offered by different departments concerned with some specific but fundamental science/engineering topics. In total, the students have to complete around 40 credits of ESO/SO courses. Departmental templates have a few compulsory ESO/SOs, while the rest are electives.",
      "The detailed rules and procedures regarding the academic curriculum including information on branch change, double major, minor, etc. can be found in the UG manual on the DoAA website.[2]",
      "Academic Environment",
      "IIT Kanpur is renowned for having one of the most flexible and unique academic curricula around the world. This flexibility promotes interaction between students across departments and batches. It also encourages students to explore a broad spectrum of topics, which proves beneficial not only in academia but also in industry. These interactions and opportunities are aimed at creating a healthy academic environment and furnish students with an enriching learning experience.",
      "The campus‚Äôs academic facilities are also world-class, with fully air-conditioned lecture halls, state-of-the-art labs, a vast library, and excellent places to study peacefully, such as the Student‚Äôs lounge, New Core Labs(NCL), etc.¬†With the covid situation incorporating a new lease of learning, it‚Äôs understandable that things won‚Äôt remain the same in the course curriculum, yet the learning through the first-hand experience, provided by the labs, brimming with students during a regular semester, have their own tales to be told.",
      "Studying at home has its own set of distractions, yet the ones experienced on campus have a more vast genre which at times needs to be dealt smartly for one‚Äôs own benefit. One being the group of people around you, during quizzes, midsems, or endsems,¬† representing the study environment which may tend to either bolster your preparation with their help and revision notes or may demotivate one‚Äôs hard work and preparation by the feeling of competitiveness among the peer, so here the choice lies in your hands to judge whether this environment around you may be toxic or not. At campus, there is no dearth of study rooms, right from the most sought after the library, where you see students stamping their bags in the tables or chairs, during peak times (which generally includes end/mid sem, but one of the most influencing factors of their occupancy is generally the ‚Äúenthu‚Äù of the incoming batch), there to safeguard their seats.",
      "Or one could use the cozy environment of CCD with comfortable chairs and adjustable round-tables where people visit more for studying over having a cup of coffee, or at the student lounge, where even a small nap could be achieved on the sofa present with the warmth to take away your all your stress(provided you don‚Äôt grab the attention of the working SIS guard :P). And the best part, where even the administration acknowledges the irregular routine of the students, is that CCD, library, student‚Äôs lounge along with the Computer Centre present in the NCL labs are open round the clock(24*7) for the whole duration of the exams",
      "The late-night ‚Äòchai‚Äô or maggie or any other snack for that matter in DoAA‚Äôs canteen, which has its doors open for campus residents even at 5 AM, gives a sense of lightness in the mind. After all, good hours of study couldn‚Äôt be topped off by a little self treat with light ‚Äúbulla‚Äù with your friends.",
      "The 1st-year IC courses lectures are held in L20, which is a massive hall with a seating capacity of about 600 students.¬†But L20 is not just a lecture hall; it is a collection of diverse groups of individuals from across the batch. The typical antics of these varied groups characterize every lecture in L20. A crowd of Maggus populating the front rows, asking doubts enthusiastically during and after every lecture hour; a couple of late-comers trying to sneak into the lecture hall without catching the eye of the instructor; the occasional hooting and laughter when these dawdlers get caught in the act and invite a sarcastic remark from the instructor‚Äôs end; a set of hungry souls continually checking the clock, waiting for the class to get over so that they can rush back to the hall canteen; a bunch of impatient fellows on the lookout for the attendance machine, waiting to mark their attendance and sneak away in the middle of the class; an enthusiastic clan of gamers occupying the last few rows, testing the best angles to conceal their mobile phones from the strict instructors; an avid reader seated in a distant corner of the lecture hall, deeply engrossed in a novel, cut off from the rest of the material world; and a horde of sleepy individuals, dozing off between lectures, trying to make up for the sleep they lost due to last night‚Äôs bulla session.",
      "Cut to 2020.",
      "The crowd of Maggus is trying their level best to show enthusiasm (and gain some participation marks) by spamming the chat-box; the late-comers are stuck in the waiting room, pinging their peers to remind the instructor to let them in; the random conversations from the end of the poor chap who forgot to turn off his mic cracks everyone up at their desk; the occasional Zoom-bombing prompts the instructor to mute everyone; the set of hungry souls are busy having lunch during the classes; the multi-tasking gamers have minimized Zoom, and are busy playing the latest multiplayer game to viral, and the sleepy individuals have muted the meeting and have fallen into a deep slumber.",

      "KIAP (Kanpur Indo-American Program) was instrumental in building the very foundation of IITK. The institute has taken a lot from the Mentor American universities, including their culture and student union system. The Students‚Äô Gymkhana is a fully student-run organization that comprises various councils, cells, committees, and the Students‚Äô Senate. The Gymkhana model aims to instill a sense of leadership, responsibility, and management in the student community by exposing them to real-life problems and key decision-making scenarios to make students better prepared for the future that awaits them.",
      "The Gymkhana consists of the President‚Äôs Office, the Students‚Äô Senate, and the four councils, which are MnC, SnT, GnS, and AnC. You would‚Äôve probably met the heads of the councils, the General Secretaries, during your orientation. (That is if you attended it :P).",
      "President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana",
      "At the apex of the Students‚Äô Gymkhana sits the President, who is the representative of the students of IIT Kanpur at all forums of the institute. The President is elemental in coordinating the general affairs of the student body. The President aims to be the voice of the 7000 (Numbers invite attention) students that reside at our Kalyanpur Campus. (like we have many XD)",
      "The President is a member of various campus communities and works for the betterment of the student community. The Academic Senate (considered the highest policy-making body of the institute), Institute Affairs Committee, Anti-Ragging Committee among others are forums where the President actively participates to address and resolve the grievances of the students. The President is also invited to the Board of Governors‚Äô meetings when matters relating to students are discussed.",
      "It is also the duty of the president to coordinate and supervise all the cells, councils, and festivals to ensure smooth conduct of all activities throughout the academic year. Currently, the President is Mr. Nikunj Kothari, Y17.",
      "Sounds like a lot of work and responsibility, right?",
      "To aid and complement the President in their duties, the President‚Äôs Office was inaugurated in the academic year 2016-17 which comprised members at various levels to broaden the vision and reach of the President‚Äôs scope of work. The Executive Council of the President‚Äôs Office takes up a plethora of initiatives such as Convocation, Gymkhana Day, Yearbook, Senior Year Mentorship Program, etc. for the upliftment of the student community. The council coordinates with various Institute level committees such as the Animal Welfare cell, Environment Advisory Committee, Academics and Ethics cell, etc. to ensure a congenial environment for the holistic development of all.",
      "Students‚Äô Senate of the Gymkhana, IITK",
      "Our own legislative body: the Students‚Äô Senate, consists of members of the Senate, called the Senators, who are elected by their own batch. The Senate represents the collective voice of all the students. The heads of the various councils, which you would‚Äôve met during your orientation, are ex-officio members of the Senate.",
      "Like all legislative bodies, the Students‚Äô Senate keeps a check on all student activities, especially that of the Students‚Äô Gymkhana, and is the central policy-making student body. In normal years, the election for the Students‚Äô Senate and the executives are held during mid-January, and the charge is handed over in early March.Again, just like the Speaker of the US House of Representatives or the Indian Loksabha, we have the Chairperson of the Senate: they are the person responsible for running the Senate. Along with the President, he/she is ex-officio nominated in many of the institute committees, e.g. the Academic Senate. Currently, the Chairperson is Mr. Yash Maheshwari, Y17.",
      "The Senate is a general forum for all students, has many sub-committees that have confined domains and are responsible for specific issues, like UG-SAC which deals mostly with the academic matters of the UGs, RPC, which constantly works on filling the loopholes and bettering the Gymkhana constitution, and CoSHA which is responsible for the supervising the functioning of the Halls of Residence.",
      "Other than that, the Senate has its own nominees to various institute committees like the SUGC, which is a committee comprising of various professors who create major policies for the UGs, like branch change; the SSAC (a word the whole campus fears) which deals with the disciplinary cases of the students; and the SSPC, which works in tandem with the DoSA for the disbursement of various scholarships and prizes.",
      "Cells of the Students‚Äô Gymkhana",
      "1. E-Cell",
      "Entrepreneurship Cell IIT Kanpur is a non-profit organization aiming to induce an entrepreneurial mindset in the students. They focus on watering the ‚ÄòIdeas‚Äô in the bud and help them bloom into impactful endeavors through networking student enterprises from campus to incubators, seeding funds, and angel investors to transform the newly proposed ideas into successful start-ups.",
      "The team comprises ‚ÄúCore Team‚Äù members, ‚ÄùSecretaries‚Äù (2nd Year), and ‚ÄúVolunteers‚Äù (1st-year students).¬†E-Cell organizes an abundance of events throughout the year to promote entrepreneurial activities in and around the campus. The annualE-Summitwitnessed massive participation from all over India with events like TEDx and StartUp Master Class. E-Cell also conducts various lectures and workshops focused on budding entrepreneurs. Startup Internship Programme helps IITK students land internships in start-ups and know their working in greater depth.",
      "During the pandemic, virtual events like ‚ÄúEntrepreneurial Extravaganza‚Äù, ‚ÄúEntrepreneurial Bootcamp‚Äù and numerous talks by eminent entrepreneurs were held.",
      "In this semester, Startup Internship Program, Business Week (real-world business problems), and workshops by renowned entrepreneurs/businessmen) have been planned to be organized.¬†A full-fledged course on entrepreneurship in the course curriculum is planned to be introduced in the future.",
      "CWC",
      "The Community Welfare Cell (CWC) works for a campus ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô which extends not only to the student and the faculty members, but also to the staff members, the workers and their families, and all individuals who are related to the campus.",
      "The Cell currently has five wings under it:",
      "1.Prakriti, working in the field of environmental awareness and impact assessment to achieve equality in terms of sustainability.",
      "2.Prayas, working in the field of education for the marginalized sections of the society to achieve equality in educational opportunities.",
      "3.Raktarpan, working to combat blood shortage in order to achieve equality in proper healthcare facilities.",
      "4.Unmukt, working to address the gender and sexual diversity in the community and to achieve equality against discrimination.",
      "5.Vivekananda Samiti, working to spread the message of Swami Vivekananda among the campus residents and helping the entire community tackle its problems through motivation and inspiration.",
      "Election Commission",
      "Election Commission works to conduct fair elections, providing a democratic setup to choose the Gymkhana Executives, and Senators. In the General Election, conducted sometime after the start of the Even semester, positions like the President, General Secretaries are open for elections.",
      "The team consists of a Chief Election Officer (usually 4th Year), Managers of Election Commission (usually 3rd Year), Senior Election Officers (usually 2nd Year), and Election Officers (usually 1st Year). Joining the Election Commission would give you an overview of work in an election ranging from (but not limited to), ratifying manifestos, vigilance during code of conduct, working at polling booths, counting of votes, and conducting executive debates.",
      "Vox Populi",
      "Vox Populi, the journalism body of IIT Kanpur, is among the most dynamic and actively growing student bodies on campus. Vox works at catering to campus residents, alumni, and other stakeholders through print and online media. In recent years Vox has played crucial roles in delivering impactful pieces and bringing stories of different walks of life to the campus junta and providing voices to the voiceless. (But we would rather let you be the witness of it.)",
      "Outreach Cell",
      "Outreach Cell is the Students‚Äô Gymkhana body that works in collaboration with the Dean of Resources and Alumni, IIT Kanpur. Contributing to the crucial avenues of strengthening student-alumni relations, they publicize achievements of IIT Kanpur and organize outreach programs in IIT Kanpur.¬†This work of the Outreach Cell has been divided into three wings:",
      "Alumni Relations:The Alumni Relations wing is the direct point of contact with the outside world: maintaining relations with alumni by attending meetups and alumni chapters across the country, spreading awareness among potential students by visiting cities to organize info sessions, and also getting in touch with the corporate world for collaborations.",
      "Creatives:The Creatives wing works towards generating engaging content to create a positive image of the institute like content for future students‚Äô website and offline sessions, presentations at alumni meet, collating, and pitching Students‚Äô Gymkhana proposals to corporates, etc. This content is finally published by the design team and web team.",
      "Campus:The Campus wing works actively on events for student-faculty relations. The team works hard to¬†publicize student research and achievements of various cells/clubs leading to raise funding for student-led projects. They have successfully conducted campaigns such as #ThatsIITK, #AskIITK for prospective students.",
      "The outreach cell opens recruitment for the students from their 2nd year as secretaries, where they assist the managers of their respective wings in the works pertaining to the cell. They can work in various divisions of the cell, i.e. Alumni, Creative, or Campus wing.",
      "Throughout the year, Outreach Cell conducts numerous talks, and student-alumni engagement sessions like Tips from the Top, Heritage Search, and Distinguished Alumni Interviews. They support the Institute in planning the Convocation Ceremony, Alumni Gatherings, and Alumni Branch Meetings. A few steps to improve the relations between campus students and IITK alumni, such as the Alumni Buddy Program and Mock-en-Joy, are also taken annually.",

      "Disclaimer: Summarizing Life at IITK is impossible. It is a different and unique experience for everyone. We wrote the following article as a light-hearted piece based on some of the experiences we have had and observed. Always remember that the possibilities are limitless.",
      "5:50 am",
      "You set the alarm for 5:50 am. Guess why? The dreaded PE class was to strike again tomorrow, and you believed 10 minutes are sufficient to get ready. If you get late by even a minute, the PE grounds‚Äô gates would be closed, and you would be marked absent. (75% attendance is compulsory)",
      "However, at 5:30 am, you are woken up by an annoying buzzing alarm, ruining 20 precious minutes of your sleep. Nevertheless, you dutifully wake up your wingies for PE and rush to the ground.",
      "If it‚Äôs your first PE class and your name starts with an ‚ÄòA,‚Äô there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll be seen at the main sports stadium. For all the athletics enthusiasts, it‚Äôs a huge ground with a well-maintained grass track. Discus throw, pole vault, long jump, running, you‚Äôll get to try it all! Besides, there are nets as well as a pitch for cricket lovers.",
      "For the unique ones, whose names start with a ‚ÄòZ‚Äô or a ‚ÄòY‚Äô, you‚Äôll have to walk or cycle to the hockey and football ground: a fascinating place for the risk-takers, since it is pretty easy to escape back to your hall after marking your attendance here (Not recommended at all!). Opposite the ground, you‚Äôll find the New SAC, where there are three indoor wooden badminton courts, well-maintained squash courts and a big wooden-floored TT room. The swimming coach will also accompany a few of you from the ground to the Olympic-size 8-lane swimming pool, where you can try a few strokes or even play water polo.",
      "If you find yourself marking attendance at the Old SAC, you‚Äôll be divided into the four courts and try your hand volleyball. Just adjacent to the volleyball courts, there are two walls for brushing up your tennis skills before you play in one of the six synthetic courts. At this location only, there is a fully equipped gym for the fitness freaks where you can have a go at weightlifting.",
      "Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt get to play your favourite sport in the first class; you‚Äôll get to try them all out. If you‚Äôre too eager, you‚Äôre welcome to visit any of the facilities during the open hours.",
      "7 am",
      "Huff, all this running in the morning must be tiring. The feeling of coming back from PE, throwing your shoes, and crashing out on the bed is inexplicable. But wait, it‚Äôs been two weeks, and you haven‚Äôt done your laundry. You reluctantly get up and head to the shared washroom area with your clothes, and to your disappointment, find the only washing machine occupied. You can‚Äôt bathe too, because all the bathrooms are in use. At this moment, if you‚Äôre determined to complete the chores, you‚Äôll walk to some other wing and try your luck. But on the way, you might find yourself knocking on the door of your friend‚Äôs room and spend an hour cribbing about laundry, life, academics and PE. It‚Äôs likely that you will form long-lasting bonds with your wingies and often find 8-9 people hanging out in small rooms meant for two.",
      "8:35 am",
      "It‚Äôs time to get to the mess, have a quick breakfast and head for the classes. If you don‚Äôt have time, you can always grab a few biscuits and rush! There are 20 lecture halls, out of which you have to find yours. Most of your lectures in the first year will be conducted in the L20, the biggest lecture hall of IITK with a capacity to accommodate more than 500 students. For the tutorials, you‚Äôll have to make your way to another lecture hall or go to the tutorial block in the short 10-minute gap between lectures. The skywalk in the academic area is a fast way to navigate through the complex. Getting lost in the maze-like lecture hall complex is inevitable, but beautiful in its own way! You may, accidentally, fall asleep during lectures but friends at your side will shove you into consciousness.",
      "To satisfy hunger between lectures, you could make your way to the SL canteen to grab a cup of coffee or tea, along with Maggi or a samosa. Next to it, there‚Äôs CCD, an aromatic storehouse of caffeine that keeps you up during ‚Äòtwilight‚Äô hours to study for exams. (Search: Twilight CCD). During winter months, basking in the sun while sitting on the ground in front of L20 with friends is a common idea to pass time as well. The most important part, do not forget to lock your cycle; otherwise, there‚Äôs a good chance the SIS guards would confiscate your cycle, and you‚Äôll be asked to find ‚Äòproof of ownership‚Äô.",
      "1:10pm",
      "After your class, you‚Äôll need to rush directly to the mess if you want to avoid an extremely long queue. It is humanly impossible to have your lunch in 40 minutes and reach the lab on time (at 2 pm). So, as they say, desperate times call for desperate measures: you‚Äôll scan through the queue carefully and spot a wingie or a random person you met once in the orientation. Next step, do some small talk with the person and casually, insert yourself right before him in the queue. This strategy works most of the time when you need to expedite the process of getting lunch. If you are lucky enough, you might also get the Paneer in the Matter Paneer.",
      "The food by itself might not be so tasty, but it‚Äôs decent and one can easily manage. A pinch of laughter and a handful of intellectual conversation with your batchmates over the mess table makes it taste even better. By the time you finish your lunch, it is already 1:50, and you have to rush to the labs.",
      "2 pm",
      "Most of the labs are in the New Core Lab Building (a.k.a NCL). The ESC101 labs are air-conditioned and comfortable. Most importantly, you can go to the lab in shorts andchappal. For those who solve the coding problems way too quickly, receiving many deadly stares from batchmates would be a common sighting.¬†However, for the Physics labs and Chemistry labs, you need to wear shoes with full pants and lab glasses along with a lab coat, respectively.¬†Remember to write the practicals before coming to the lab!¬†The labs do have some cool stuff, like an electron beam and chemicals to make beautiful blue-coloured imprints. Most often, you‚Äôll get your readings wrong, but then what are friends for? ;).",
      "The only lab not in the NCL is the TA101 lab. The lab is located in the most unfounded corners of the academic area. For this lab, you need to carry a drafter, cello tapes, erasers, pencils, among other instruments.¬†Getting those marks for neatness, despite the numerous erased pencil marks, is the real challenge.",
      "5 pm",
      "The grind never ends. After long hours of labs and lectures, you‚Äôll now head to CPA/CCA (Compulsory Physical/Cultural Activities). If you have opted for sports, you‚Äôll go to the respective courts/grounds for intense practice sessions. Apart from mainstream sports, there are various other options one may opt from like Yoga, Taekwondo, wall-climbing, NCC, NSS, dance, arts or dramatics.¬†¬†New SAC has a spacious yoga and aerobics hall where you can workout. Just behind the new SAC building, there‚Äôs a wall-climbing rock for all the adventure enthusiasts. At last, for those of you interested in self-defence, the main ground stadium is the place to be in the evenings.",
      "7 pm",
      "Generally, you could attend one of the many competitions/workshops/events/talks happening on the campus. However, on the days you have a club meeting, you‚Äôll head to the new SAC (Student Activity Centre).",
      "Most of the cultural clubs have an allotted room here, in the new SAC (right beside the OAT), where they conduct their events, meetings and bulla-sessions. If you are in the Astronomy Club, you‚Äôd be sitting in their beautiful student-made planetarium on the rooftop. If you are in the Student Senate or one of the many student-led committees, you‚Äôll be meeting in a modern carpeted conference room, which is designed to look like a mini-Parliament. The sheer diversity of people, ideas and events that we do, as the student community at IIT Kanpur is fascinating.",
      "From the freshers‚Äô night to the dance and music competitions for Galaxy (inter-hall cultural competition) to movie or match screenings, the OAT (open-air theatre) plays a host for all the major campus events. Days, when OAT is jam-packed with the audience, is a sight to behold.",
      "Right behind the OAT is the Pronite ground, which hosts the biggest concerts during Antaragni and Techkriti. Also, behind the OAT is the oxidation pond, a quiet pond with lots of ducks and swans. Interestingly, these are the corners of the campus, much like the airstrip, which you don‚Äôt get to visit on regular days.",
      "A meeting at the new SAC is generally followed by exciting conversations over a Kathi roll or a Dominoes pizza, for dinner.",
      "10 pm",
      "Done with the extracurriculars, now you‚Äôll need to study for the upcoming quiz. While some people prefer studying in their room, the constant noise and unending mischiefs may make your room unconducive to study. So let‚Äôs explore some other options.",
      "Firstly, the PK Kelkar library: a three-floored (plus a basement), building, stocked with tall shelves of books, journals and archives.The library‚Äôs wooden furniture and the comfortable central air-conditioning system reflects on the library as a confluence of the archaic and the modern. Subsumed in extreme silence, it is an abode for themaggus. The library generally closes at midnight but around the exams, it remains open for 24 hours. As a consequence, people sleeping between the shelves, with a blanket and a bedsheet, planning to directly go for the exam next morning is a common sight.",
      "However, on normal days, when the library closes at midnight, one can escape from the heat of the rooms by entering the air-conditioned RM building(Rajeev Motwani building). Although it is the official building for the CSE department, it is used across the branches for its comfortable couches.",
      "You may also choose to study at the Student Lounge. It has couches, comfortable office chairs, tables and AC. Finding a place in the lounge is a matter of sheer luck. On days when you need to use a computer, you‚Äôd visit the Computer Centre. It has huge labs with rows of computers that you can freely use for studies. The computer centre also houses the supercomputer.",
      "12 midnight",
      "This would be a good point to call it a day and return to your bed to fall sleep. However, it would be difficult to resist the urge to sit with your wingies in one room. You‚Äôll join the bulla and the conversation would flow from ranting about academics to confessions on everyone‚Äôs crushes. It might even result in a heated discussion on national politics or diverse social issues as well. If that isn‚Äôt for you, then playing Mafia, CoD or CS:GO is also always an alternative.",
      "2 am",
      "After exhausting all the topics of discussion and debate, you‚Äôll feel hungry and rush to the canteen for late-night Maggi for it closes at 2. At last, you‚Äôll head to your bed and fall asleep, hopefully, satisfied with the growth, memories and studies you were able to extract from the day. If not, you will get another chance when you wake up. The upcoming four years are going to be diverse and life-changing, and we hope you‚Äôre ready for both the highs and the lows.",
      "More than the infrastructure, the classes and the labs, it is your interaction with people around you and the random bulla sessions in the wing, canteens and clubs that have a significant role in making up your ‚Äòlife on campus!‚Äô",

      "To our dearest juniors of Y20,",
      "We hope each one of you is keeping well in these uncertain and cruel times. It is a fair assumption that you must be desperately waiting to come to the land of your dreams. But the day you finally do take the sharp turn from GT road to pass the level crossing, the boldly written ‚ÄúIndian Institute of Technology Kanpur‚Äù on the wall along its entrance might just steal your heart at once. That moment will make you recall the painstaking journey you took up 2 years back, every sweat you shed preparing, and the memory of each day that you challenged and sacrificed to achieve what you deserve. Congratulations mate! You are an IITian, from this day on. We can‚Äôt wait to see your bright shining faces and welcome you to the glorious legacy and vibrant community of IITK.",
      "It is truly ineffable and heartbreaking not to meet you in person, but until then, let us still provide you with a sneak peek, or an IITK 101 to get you on board for the most fascinating, incredible, and in all likelihood, the best years of your life. This is the perfect time for you to explore and experiment. We guarantee that you will be marvelled by the length of diversity in your options. Allow yourself to branch out, meet people beyond your classrooms and make the most of this platform you have achieved. Always remember, the prerequisite for anything is ‚Äòenthu‚Äô alone! We don‚Äôt want to give away everything to preserve for you the thrill of first-hand experiences, but we don‚Äôt want to keep you in the dark either. Hopefully, this following series of articles will answer all of your questions and succeed in giving you an impression of how life at IITK looks like. The purpose of this series is to keep your fad of college life still ablaze and to make you realise that college life is so much more than just academics and lectures. We aim to acquaint you with the functioning of the institute and the values we uphold as its students. Above all, we want you to feel proud of being a lifetime member of the memoirs of IITK.",
      "What‚Äôs coming up next?",
      "Exploring your majestic campus (contrasting starkly with the outside city of Kanpur), which you would brag about as your second home, must be the first on your checklist. Naturally, the list of hangout spots and must-visit places would help you navigate through the 1000 acres of campus grounds. And we better get you used to the IITK lingo as well through this one. Keep an eye for the next article on campus life.",
      "As a student, academics would hold great value and importance in your life and the freedom offered to you by the institute in choosing your electives should be wisely used. Familiarity with the general rules and procedures of structure in place would decidedly be of great benefit. We got that sorted for you in yet another upcoming article in this series.",
      "At least we all can hope that normality finds its way back to our lives and after whining about the exhausting course work, frequent quizzes, unbearable midsems, and ruthless endsems, we can all return to our hostels to let go of it all. Complain about that stressful course or crib about the horrible mess food, chill with our wingies, share a pizza, celebrate birthdays with midnight parties and dance crazy to random songs, only to finally fall asleep on our grumpy old beds. Through its hardships, hostel life will teach you lessons that no amount of classroom teaching ever can. Until you get to start with yours, feel free to take some lessons from our experiences in another article.",
      "Throughout your journey, there will be several guiding bodies helping you find your footing, raise the bar and shine. The SnT council will take you beyond the 4 walled academics and help polish your innovative skills. The GnS council will teach you the important lessons of fitness, sportsmanship and teamwork while you play away from the worries in your lives. The MnC council caters to your artistic hobbies and building your second family in IITK. AnC council would provide you with a helping hand as you find your way into the vast academic world. But how will you participate or contribute? Find the answer in detailed articles coming up.",
      "In an otherwise restless semester, the annual festivals namely Antaragni, Techkriti and Udghosh provide us with a much needed moment to relax. With the campus all lit up and populated with guests, the overall vibe resonates highly with our spirit. Those 4 days filled with glamorous events, pro-nites and night-outs are arguably the most fun and memorable ones. Encapsulating the experience of a fest in an article is nearly impossible, but we shall try our best to give you a brief and exhilarating summary in another upcoming article.",
      "Ultimately, the point is simply to tell you that something awesome awaits you! This pandemic has, of course, dampened the excitement of being a fresher. The campus which would have been abuzz with introductory activities to welcome you now wears a deserted look. The canteens and hostels which would have witnessed innumerable bulla sessions now long for your presence. But, there is an end to this tunnel and we hope that we come out stronger than ever before. If you ever feel stuck, remember that your bapu/amma is just one call away. Your batch has received the most unconventional orientation, but nonetheless, we don‚Äôt want you to miss out on any more ingredients that make your college life memorable. At last, welcome to IITK!",

      "Vox Populi brings to you the second edition of the series Campus Blueprints: The Journey of Unmukt. We interviewed one of the founders of Unmukt, Manish Gautam, and few of the most active volunteers, Ayush Mukherjee, Aditya Bansal, Ranjith Jaganathan, to bring to you an overview of how Unmukt was able to evolve over the years, the work that has been accomplished by Unmukt, and how, as a club, it propagates the awareness of the LGBTQ+ community in our campus. Read on to find out more about it!",
      "Laying the foundations of Unmukt",
      "The idea to start Unmukt wasn‚Äôt formally taken into account. It was around February 2013 when, in a casual conversation with Amrita Arya, Manish realized that IITK had no student body working for voicing the issues of the LGBTQ community. While several other colleges including IIT Bombay had verticals dedicated to their welfare. Being an alumnus, the initial task was to reach out to people on the campus. Someday in July 2013, an open discussion on the topic gathered countable faculty members and students who vehemently embraced the initiation of such a body. Prof. Suchitra Mathur and Prof. Junaki Sen enthusiastically joined in and guided the members. Several volunteers then made their way towards working actively for this cause. Until it became a club, Unmukt organised a few informal unstructured events which later on gained grounds and accentuated to mark the beginning of a successful initiative.",
      "Around 2014, after several senior working members graduated, the activities of the group significantly reduced and it remained inactive for long. Ayush came to be associated with Unmukt in 2016, learning in the process that it had an informal history in which members preceding him discussed gender and sexuality-related issues.¬† In 2016, Unmukt finally became a part of the Community Welfare Cell, under the presidency of Ashutosh Ranka. Ayush, being anointed as the overall coordinator, started off to revive the club‚Äôs activities. The agenda was laid out, they built on the definition of gender and sexuality and started putting their interpretations to it. With all the input, Unmukt was clearly defined in the context of Students‚Äô Gymkhana.",
      "Overcoming the obstacles during the early days",
      "Unmukt, being initiated on a completely different concept, had limited people working for it. Thus, several initiatives had to be kick-started to revive the club‚Äôs existence and draw people‚Äôs attention. However, the cycle of organising events without members and expecting members without undertaking events was iterative. Also, given the general stigma surrounding this issue, conducting events which could easily draw a significant crowd was a huge challenge. The main task was to normalise people with the conversation and make them assess the situation. All of these efforts invited both criticism and consent. While it was affirmed to become a club, several people were enthralled on the thought that the notion of gender diversity would finally be informally addressed and talked about. On the other side, there also came questions on the vision of Unmukt and the need for a gender and sexuality club on campus. This is something that Unmukt still struggles with. Ayush classifies this as a two-pronged problem, one in terms of ideology and others in terms of practice.",
      "Garnering support on campus",
      "When it came to volunteers, CWC‚Äôs most active club, Prayas, had people turning up in good numbers, but this participation was intermittent. Although both our interviewees remain dubious about this non-participation persisting on just our campus, they acknowledge that it always remains challenging to get volunteers for any social cause. Following this, Unmukt had just four members in January 2017. But this less participation did not prove to be a setback and the team instigated its activities with complete motivation. They started by researching and gathering knowledge before taking the issues out to the campus. After a few months, they began circulating and re-circulating forms. Thereby, with the involvement of more people, things progressed more efficiently. Though the response from the campus students was never sufficient, and even now, they do not have more than 60-70 members. At times, the work was even ridiculed by the people. A lot of members did not take that well; some were even personally targeted. But over the years, as a positive surprise, the campus community has come to accept Unmukt and what it stands for.",
      "Activities: Engaging the community",
      "The team back then initiated activities that involved less effort and had a greater impact. The aim was primarily to acquaint people with the initiative and motivate them to engage and contribute to the same. A couple of open meets were conducted, and the team worked with the ELS to organize some themed competitions. A campaign was deployed in collaboration with other IITs and IIMs during the summers. The team interviewed several people, which made them reach out to the campus junta and uphold their participation. Apart from being socially active, other reading and discussion groups were also operated regularly. But despite such efforts, most of the activities didn‚Äôt gain attention. This was even worsened by the cancellation of Melange, a presidential council festival which was organised every year and hosted multiple competitions. After Melange wasn‚Äôt brought into action, the plans of conducting events as a part of it were completely obliterated.",
      "‚ÄúQueen-size‚Äù Event",
      "‚ÄúQueen Size‚Äù is a choreographic exploration that takes the form of a detailed study of the intimacy between two men. Played out on a ‚Äòcharpoy bed‚Äô, the duet makes an embodied argument for the fundamental right to love. In deliberately making this encounter visible, Queen-size poses questions around spectatorship, privacy, and dissent. It explores the intricacies of desire and physical intimacy.",
      "In one of the courses that Ranjith took up, Professor Suchitra Mathur asked students to derive the literary comparison and themes between two plays. One of the plays presented was Queen Size. The one who presented the idea of this play approached the queen size team and asked whether they can do the play in IITK. The request was then forwarded to the Unmukt team and they took the charge of conducting the event ‚ÄúQueen Size‚Äù for campus janta! However, Aditya pointed out that initially the team was highly strung on how it will be carried out, what to present on the poster and whether or not admin would give the permission to carry out this play.",
      "They wrote a letter to DoSA and got it signed by the faculty advisor which was then Prof. Suchitra Mathur. The student gymkhana was requested to forward the email notifying campus janta of this event and the faculty advisor to all the professors.",
      "For this particular event, the volunteers were asked to distribute a piece of paper at the exit gate which had the printed content of the theme of this play. The Unmukt team printed out around 50 posters. The campus janta turned out in good numbers, making the event eminent.",
      "Path to a forum for free expression",
      "A large part of what Unmukt talks about is Representation. Over the years, it has tried to create awareness to understand our own selves and dispel the rigidity of expressing who we are. However, it wasn‚Äôt easy to eradicate the stigma surrounding it. The need was to stay attentive to all such issues on campus; to look for, identify and address them. Unmukt started by making forums where people could discuss all such problems without any fear of being judged. Also, there were plans to conduct surveys to understand the diversity on the campus and reach everyone at the same time. But those surveys couldn‚Äôt be undertaken despite much discussion. The team also thought to work as a support group for the campus community, but the idea had its pros and cons and invited conflicts. Though, despite every such struggle, Unmukt evolved as a platform to address the notion of gender and sexual diversity while encouraging everyone to recognise, accept and admire themselves the way they are.",
      "Transformation of Unmukt and its current state",
      "Ayush states that in some aspects, he didn‚Äôt envision the club to be the way it is now. The focus currently is less on the campus and more towards the outside world. Being a student of IITK, he feels it to be a responsibility to stay attentive to issues of campus junta first and then talk about the outside world. Emphasising on this point, he says,",
      "‚ÄòThough the work accomplished by the current members of Unmukt is laudable, the tasks carried out by the team, at a certain time, must be contextualised to what is happening immediately around us. The thought should be on how we should envision a broader and more familiar idea of the community into the workings of our own small-scale groups.‚Äò",
      "Manish, on the other hand, points out the need to work on a greater level, stating,",
      "‚ÄòThough the progress has been good, I am unsure of how sensitive and reachable the club has been to the issues prevalent in society i.e. outside the campus. Thus, a proper and ubiquitous addressal is fairly needed. And to reciprocate in a better way, the team should be confident enough to interact and dynamic enough to cover up the loopholes in the club‚Äôs functioning.‚Äô",
      "While on the other side, he expresses his delight in the way the club has functioned and progressed in changing the sceptic outlook of the society. The campus has now transformed to become more open and non-judgemental. He assures that the club is meant to strive even further and stay as an ally to every single person on campus. He also affirms to support every decision taken by members and guide them throughout.",
      "Unforgettable experiences of Ayush and Manish",
      "Ayush mentions that the time spent as a part of Unmukt has been memorable. Amongst all the other activities, the most engaging part was taking interviews. For the most part, they used to stick to gender-based interviews and did not go too subjectively sexually in interviews and the kind of stories they came across through these interviews were inspiring and memorable.",
      "Being remotely involved in the club, Manish admits that there wasn‚Äôt anything dramatic an experience which he faced. Everything went on smoothly without any hassles.",
      "A long-lasting bond with Unmukt",
      "Being one of the early members of Unmukt, Ayush still ushers and lends his services for it. Although guiding in his opinion is more of an authoritative relationship, which has been problematic for the club in the past. However, he remains approachable to all the club members and helps them whenever needed. On the progress so far, he remarks,",
      "‚ÄòBy far, the initiatives taken in the cultural domain are appreciable. The interactive activities carried out and the ideas shared by the current and past members of the team are the most refreshing aspects of the working. While functioning under the domain of awareness, the aim should be to better understand the historical and political positions of a person, to always look for effective ways of conversing, and to remember the importance of communication.‚Äô",
      "While stating the same, Manish also attributes the club‚Äôs progress to the continuous efforts of present and former members and adds that the seniors aren‚Äôt meant to tell the team how to do things, even as a part of the guidance. He appreciates the progress till date, from enrolling more volunteers to organising events related to LGBT issues and spreading the required awareness, he is optimistic with where the club is heading.",

      "‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî",
      "From maintaining the utilitarian website with 3.5 lakh views to becoming the National Social Service, IIT Kanpur‚Äôs Student Coordinator, my life has been full of ups and downs and never short of a roller coaster ride.",
      "I have been living in a hostel away from my family for the past 17 years and as a consequence, I had a very unusual childhood. It is what made social service seem appealing to me in the first place. I was in class 3 when I was first admitted to a hostel. Soon after, I made an unsuccessful attempt at running away. When I was caught and brought back, I started submitting blank sheets in the exams and intentionally failed. My parents saw through my trick and asked me to repeat the same class until I passed. With no way of escape in sight, I started working on making my stay better. Ironically enough, studies quickly became my best companion.",
      "However, I had limited academic guidance, and when I looked around, I found plenty like me. There are many with the talent to excel who suffer due to the lack of a guiding light. Many succumb to parental pressure while others remain ignorant of possible opportunities. While I was able to find my true calling, many of my friends were not as lucky. This reality became the seed of my helping nature. I believe that the first step to improving the lives of others is by improving oneself. So I concentrated on studying and cleared the JEE.",
      "I came to IIT with the ambition of doing something remarkable in academics, having almost nil information about social service in IITK. But gradually, my dreams started to feel unattainable as I lost focus on my academics. On the bright side, IIT Delhi initiated the ‚ÄòUnnat Bharat Abhiyan‚Äô program across various institutions at the end of my first year. We received a mail stating ‚Äúanyone interested in providing helping hands, can join us‚Äù. It allowed me to take my worrying mind off academics and work on something I love. The first meeting was a brainstorming session about ways to help the nearby villagers. I decided to take charge of making Baikunthpur, a nearby village, digitally literate.",
      "With the permission of Rita ma‚Äôam, I surveyed the village. I found that the majority of them had no idea about the various privileges and schemes offered to them by the government. I resolved to work on this issue, and the response we received was overwhelming. Soon there were two batches of 30 visiting the campus four times a week. My ‚Äòstudents‚Äô included people of all ages, from fresh graduates to a couple in their 60s. After the semester-long program, they were all able to do a variety of tasks like checking their land registry and applying for Aadhar. I reran the program in my 4th semester, and we successfully completed our primary goal. Through these experiences, I gained valuable insights into their lives. I observed the existent political and religious barriers in the villages, and how a simple program like ours holds the potential to break these barriers and help unify people.",
      "During my boring summer break, I tried to address a problem I had faced. I was seriously troubled collecting previous papers of specific courses in my first year. The content was still available but scattered in several small sites that had minimal reach. I had found an appropriate objective for my website. So I contacted all my seniors and batchmates for papers and course material. Many dropped exam papers in front of my door while others mailed me, and I reached the point where I had sufficient material. I honestly never expected it would reach many and initially, it didn‚Äôt. When the next batch arrived, there was the usual fear and confusion regarding MTH101 lectures and CHM101 reports. Someone must have shared my website link because overnight my mailbox was flooded with requests for study material of other subjects. I then realised that I needed to get serious about this little venture. I created my new domain and made it self-sustaining by allowing everyone to upload material directly. Since then, it has kept on growing.",
      "This newfound passion in my work also helped me manage my academics more efficiently. Out of my several exciting experiences, one never fails to amuse me. In my 5th semester, I received a mail from the DoAA office regarding some roll number mismatch in the mid-sem paper of a course. As it turned out, a student had given the entire test during his free time and written my name and some random roll number as a joke. My work had made me a known figure and all I could think was,‚ÄúBhai, itna bhi naam nahi karna tha!‚Äù",
      "Moving forward, I started engaging myself in other activities of UBA like organising camps of various government schemes such as Widow Pension, PWD scholarship, etc. Rita ma‚Äôam had the idea of structuring the events of UBA, and multiple positions of responsibilities were allotted to different people. Being one of the active members, I was assigned the role of a Student Coordinator. To this day, I continue to manage all the activities while finding new ways through which I can contribute.",
      "My life has had several lows and the only reason I could face them was my emotional stability. Academically, I did not have a comfortable start in IITK but now, I am content with everything I did because I could help and progress with my fellow mates. CPI undeniably plays an important role but life is a much bigger game. Reaching out to new people, learning about them and how they deal with various situations is one of the best ways to grow. Emotional and Technical Intelligence together pave the way to a happier life.",

      "Countdown had begun, and the last few months were left to leave the campus. Everyone wants to live their lives to the fullest, but unfortunately, we missed these beautiful days to relive and glorify the moments because of the COVID-19¬† lockdown. I am feeling delighted and excited to share the experience for the Vox‚Äôs As We Leave. The experience, journey, and life at IITK were genuinely mesmerizing. Even after being a Master‚Äôs guy who usually gets only two years at IITK, I feel the love and affection for the IITK at its crux. Now the journey started‚Ä¶.",
      "On the first day of college, I¬† was supposed to reach at Hall-11 for the Hall allotment. Everyone was busy searching for their roommates. Luckily, I met a guy from my Bachelor‚Äôs college (IET Lucknow) and decided for roommates. Within 2-3 days, I¬† got to know many from IET Lucknow joined IITK for Masters. And this was one of the best things for me because I got the community with whom I could enjoy right from the starting days of college itself. We all enjoyed the orientation program thoroughly. That was one of the best parts of the journey. During the orientation program, we were told to enjoy these days fully; because once academics take off, we would not be able to get much time for enjoyment. And that was the thing that I confronted. It‚Äôs tough to manage other things if you are very serious about academics. In the first semester itself,¬† I opted for Machine Learning (CS771), a CSE department course, and the pre-requisites were not at all fulfilled by me. I was avid for this course, but later on, it became challenging to manage. Up to the midsems, I was almost at the bottom of the course; I seemed contended and barely able to pass, and it disturbed the rest of the courses as well.",
      "At times, I felt like this course may lead to a termination warning in the first semester itself. Yes, I had an option to drop it out. But, as I opted this by my own choice, and I was fondly excited to learn it then, I thought, ‚ÄúHow can I give up on my goals so easily?‚Äù In the complete midsem break, I stayed in the hall and tried to overcome my weaknesses in the course. Although my score was moderate, I did manage to get a decent grade in CS771. This was the first hopeless fight for me. Due to average marks in the midsems, I was not getting a thesis supervisor. Day by day, I was becoming hopeless to get a supervisor. After a few months, a new professor joined our department. It was a remarkable coincidence for me that his research domain was Machine Learning, and he needed a few PGs for the research. And that‚Äôs how I got my thesis supervisor. Thank you so much, sir (Dr.Vipul Arora)! Getting a software profile job of my interest was also a hopeless fight for me. Trust me, ‚ÄúThere is always a ray of hope behind every dark cloud.‚Äù The element that I learned from these experiences is that you should be proud that you are giving the best.",
      "Just ask yourself, ‚ÄúDid you put in every single ounce of your blood, sweat, and everything to accomplish your goal?‚Äù If the answer is yes, then it‚Äôs fine irrespective of success or failure. I made some new friends in the first semester, but I did not interact much because I was stuck in the courses. From the second semester, I met a few people who eventually became the crux of this journey. It is these amazing people: Himanshu Gautam, Shweta Parihar, Akanksha Vaish).",
      "",
      "Since then the list was continuously increasing. I really wanna thank to all these guys who made my IITK life awesome. Find people who share your interests, challenge you, inspire you, and accept you just the way you are. Be with them. Trust me, they‚Äôll go a long way.",
      "",
      "Awesome SPCOM(Y18) people, Hall-11 B234 balcony view, group discussions, mugging up EE 698H, OAT rooftop dumb charades, late-night cycling, Inter IIT lockdown challenges, etc. All these fascinating instances will always be cherished. The Diwali moments on the campus were really adorable. Not only these but also the diversity that the campus focuses on. Different cultural festivals were spectacular. I am fond of dancing, and it was a dream to perform at the OAT stage before leaving the campus. Luckily, I got an opportunity in the PG fest ‚ÄòImpressions 2020‚Äô.",
      "",
      "Just explore as much as you can. In the last semester, I joined the Adventure Sports Club. The conditioning for trekking was also one of the best parts of my IITK journey. This made me know my limits, pushed the boundaries, and helped me explore areas of my mind that I probably would never have discovered and experienced.",
      "",
      "Team spirit, courage, determination, and perseverance are infectious! I realized the game is all about the mind. I enjoyed these 40 days of conditioning a lot, and this made me a go-getter. I loved the bicycle life of IITK. All the fests Udghosh, Antaragni, Techkriti silently turns the campus atmosphere into cherishable moments. It just liberates all the pressure of academic hardships, fuels us with full energy, and takes off to another world. I am going to miss these days dearly. This journey leads to many challenges in various forms, but the lesson is, ‚ÄúLess fortunate ones lead to comfortable lives. The lucky ones are tested to push beyond limits in the face of challenge‚Äù.",
      "I will be short of words to describe the education, facilities, diversity, etc., of IITK because they are phenomenal. The fundamental and essential thing that reflects from any person are their virtues and their ethics. The professors are so empathetic, compassionate, and down to earth despite the vast amount of knowledge they possess. This sparked me (a wow like feeling!) and made me a better human. Perhaps, these are the lessons that last with me rather than a mere sheet of paper. Lots of opportunities, clubs, extra-curriculums are there to benefit. I‚Äôll just say find your own interests, don‚Äôt follow the crowd, follow your bliss, and strive to keep waking up with abounding enthusiasm every morning. Envision it, manifest it.",
      "After clearing GATE 2018 and getting the SPCOM specialization in the EE department, there were lots of questions in my mind such as, ‚ÄúWill I be happy with this specialization, or I can do much better?‚Äù Well, this journey put all doubts to rest. I have neither done anything outstanding in academics nor am I graduating with a wow pointer, but it‚Äôs sure that IITK made me a good human, which is indeed required for a long race of life. The next time I hear the letters I I T K, I would be overwhelmed with gratitude.",
      "Overall, these two years were awe-inspiring. These lead to a monumental impact, and it‚Äôs indeed been an incredible journey with such a stimulating and enriching experience. I‚Äôll cherish this journey forever. Last but not least, ‚ÄúIITK ka tempo high hai.‚Äù Cheers!",

      "",
      "I‚Äôve been brought up on this campus, and academic life is mostly what I‚Äôve seen around me. Yet, it would be a mistake to say that I was prepared for life as a student here (or even knew what I was getting myself into). I did have some things easy, my unique position (as a student and a faculty kid) allowing me to often view both sides of the coin, informing my decisions and making them better. But college life is hard for everyone. We are suddenly dropped into a system that runs at a breakneck pace, herded into a group with thousand-odd strangers that we don‚Äôt fit in with. A lot of our quirks, overlooked in the shelter of our home, just do not fly in this mini-society. And a lot of our habits are not conducive to extracting the most joy and wisdom out of our time here. As a freshman, back in 2016, I was a kid with an (early) bedtime and an over-inflated sense of maturity. A lot has changed since then. I mean, all of last week I slept around 5 am.",
      "Despite the challenges this place has presented, I‚Äôve had a fantastic time here. It has been a real character-building journey, through all the laughs, lividness, successes, and self-doubts.

      "Give fresh air a chance.",
      "Oh, I cannot overstate the importance this simple lesson has played for me. I really cannot. With such a busy academic schedule, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in your head and isolate yourself. And having many non-academic interests, I often made it worse for myself. Hours spent fretting over course grades, agonizing over personal decisions, and troubleshooting club issues; the solution was always the same. Unlock my door, go for a walk, perhaps drop in on a friend and share a joke. It‚Äôs incredible how easily a change of pace lets me shift gears and re-focus. It especially helped me in my third year, when every day felt like a death sentence. I must have made my way up and down Hall 12‚Äôs wings a million times during that period. But then 4 quizzes a week, club coordinator duties, and trying to land a research internship on negligible prior experience will do that to you.",
      "I did manage to land an internship, though, and the following summer, I was off to Texas to try my hand at a topic that I knew was way above my competence level. So I did what I could, and watched alotof Netflix to get over my frustration at my unproductiveness. But those two months reinforced for me another lesson.",
      "",
      "It‚Äôs not always about the textbooks.",
      "I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had high hopes for that internship. Before it, I had spent a few weeks at IIT Kgp working on an engaging research problem that I also made progress on in that little window of time. And I had taken up a project in my 6th semester, which seemed to be progressing smoothly despite some initial setbacks. Not to mention, I knew people who had published papers off the back of summer internships like mine, in their first year even. So when I was reduced to a glorified human spell-checker-for-equations (well paid though), I couldn‚Äôt help but feel that I had screwed up somewhere. Yet I didn‚Äôt regret the way I spent my summer. I diverted my attention to non-academic pursuits: exploring the country, making friends, filling myself with invaluable experiences, and having a kick-ass 21st birthday with my cousins in DC. And that was okay. I wasn‚Äôt irresponsible about what I went there to do ‚Äì I still put in my 40-hour weeks ‚Äì but I simply reasoned that anything can lead to growth. (This realization did not come innately, of course. I have my parents to thank; it‚Äôs just one of the perks of having a prof for a dad and a counselor for a mom. Ididadmit I have things easier than many.)",
      "The concept was not new to me. Every semester I tried to strike some balance between academics and other stuff. Which, I suppose, brings me to the age-old adage.",
      "",
      "All work and no play, and all that jazz.",
      "Though I‚Äôve often seen it around me, I personally have never been able to spend all my time on coursework without taking time out of my week to do something else too. (And no research projects don‚Äôt count.) And in this aspect as well, IITK has given me options in spades. From participating in MEs to organizing quizzes to sitting in literary discussions, I have never felt like I didn‚Äôt have something to do while on campus. And that is not to mention the doors that high-speed internet opens up in streaming or downloading stuff. I must admit, there are too many options to exhaust, and I often teetered on the knife-edge of falling in too deep. I definitely ran the risk of forgetting what I was here to do in the first place ‚Äì which was academics (again,responsibility is responsibility). But on the whole, I‚Äôm glad I took the time to explore, and I am the richer for it.",
      "A similar mindset guided my choice of how to spend the summer of 2018. Where many of my batchmates pushed for academic work in the second-year summer as well, I instead went and worked for a newspaper (The Indian Express) for two months. It was everything I hoped it would be: a lovely experience, very different from the day-to-day of college life. And yet, I found that skills from each were applicable in the other. The grueling semester had already taught me how to meet an unrelenting onslaught of deadlines. Which came in handy in the newsroom, where for each article ‚Äì from start to finish ‚Äì I had only the few hours that I could cram in one day. On the other hand, working for a newspaper, I learned to ask questions unabashedly, which has definitely helped me since, both in research and in applying for internships and grad school. It just goes to show that often we are very constrained in our idea of what applies where. At least, I was. Going into the internship, I never expected it to have any relevance to what I did in college. But it turns out that a lot of what we do have far-reaching consequences, more than we can see in the moment.",
      "And this neatly summarizes what college has left me with, I believe. More than teaching me academics and engineering, these four years have pounded at what I thought I knew and understood, picking out the holes in it with alarming efficiency. The memories that I have gained here seem to have an uncanny ability to pop into relevance when I least expect it. This has been true even in these four short years. I can only wait with nervous excitement for more such moments in the future when I will again look back at the period of ‚Äô16-‚Äô20 with respect for its ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äòs‚Äù. Even with all the lessons, I fear I‚Äôm bound to repeat some mistakes I‚Äôve already made (which imparted these lessons in the first place). But, as my first year taught me quite soundly,to adapt takes time. I got time.",
      "",
      "I realize that in the course of this article, I haven‚Äôt talked much (or at all) about the role the academics itself has played in my time here. And that‚Äôs because, well, it really hasn‚Äôt caused any significant revelations. Everybody here learnssomethingabout their major, whether they want to or not. For me, I‚Äôve known since school that I‚Äôm interested in mechanics. Studying civil engineering here has taught me a fair bit of mechanics, and I have genuinely enjoyed all of it. Even the courses I absolutely hated left me with some interesting concepts or the other. But for me, it‚Äôs the other things, the memories and the wisdom, that have been the real takeaways.",

      "The remarkable functioning of clubs and cells in IITK can be attributed to it‚Äôs past; the time when it‚Äôs founders and members burnt the candles at both ends to ensure it lived up to their vision and expectations. Vox Populi brings to you the first edition of the seriesCampus blueprints:The journey of Prayas.We interviewed one of the founders of Prayas, Vijaya didi and an ex-coordinator Ekta Singh (Y15), to give an overview of how the idea of Prayas evolved over the years and how Prayas has gained love from parents of the underprivileged kids studying there. Read on to explore more of its history:",
      "",
      "",
      "The dawn of a selfless endeavour-",
      "Vijaya didi came to IIT Kanpur in 1968 and back then, she became a part of the ‚ÄòOpportunity School‚Äô to cater for the education of unprivileged kids. They aimed to teach all the children under one roof, as she was against the notion that underprivileged and affluent children can‚Äôt study together. But unfortunately, no one from the campus community supported her idea in those times. Little did she know that her efforts would embark a journey enabling, inspiring and remarkably transforming several unfortunate lives.",
      "She narrates an incident where she encountered some kids playing nearby while she was heading to school. This aroused her curiosity and she inquired whether they attended schools. To this, one of them replied, ‚ÄòWhere is the school?‚Äô. This immensely disheartened her, as in the intellectual environment of the campus, these students did not have a school to go. Therefore, with the help of volunteers from Vivekananda Samiti, she planned to educate the children who couldn‚Äôt afford to attend schools themselves. However, this wasn‚Äôt satisfactorily approved by their parents who conceived it as some deceiving educational claims. Vijaya didi, along with other volunteers, met those parents personally and assured them of proper safety and quality education.",
      "",
      "Early days: Challenges and Activities-",
      "Vijaya Didi exclaimed that she faced significant problems while starting ‚ÄòApna School‚Äô for the migrants, but for Prayas, volunteers were well responsible and did all the work on a personal level.",
      "In the initial phase of Prayas, they did not get proper space to accommodate the children and carry out the activities. All they could manage to get was a room, which Vivekananda Samiti used at night ‚Äì to run their discussions and undertake spiritual gatherings, while in the evening, classes were conducted. The request to vacate the room was denied by the Samiti Members and with the influx of a large number of students, Prayas finally shifted to Old Sac, lawns and corridors for taking classes.",
      "There were several erstwhile useful events conducted by the volunteers ‚Äì ranging from competitions to quiz programs. The funds were procured from Gymkhana and leveraged for providing all the facilities. The classes commenced from 4:30 in the evening and ended around 7. Monthly PTMs were conducted to maintain the interaction of parents, students, and teachers. Previously, games and sports were conducted every day for an hour but now only Fridays are reserved for the same, with no studies carried out that day. With students engaging in various activities, some managed to learn music from Vijaya didi herself.",
      "",
      "The Pinnacle: Recognition under Gymkhana-",
      "Initially, Prayas only existed as a small scale program for migrants‚Äô children. Vijaya didi figured that their concept of Prayas, known back then as Evening School, would likely dissolve after she moved away in 1992. But the Evening School carried on regardless of many obstacles and became an official cell under the Gymkhana, in the year 2001.",
      "Slowly, the Prayas movement became widely known on campus and students started getting involved in it in various ways. Many became more enthusiastic about teaching.",
      "Vijaya didi exclaimed that Prayas is doing a phenomenal job till date and has become more of a family than a school!",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "In the face of Adversities-",
      "Prayas, though working well, has its fair share of ups and downs. For instance, it has become more difficult to work in IITK now that there are many new rules and regulations ‚Äì making aspects like arranging logistics has become more strenuous.",
      "Children come to Prayas from Nankari and far off places like Naramau in thousands of numbers and so, there are entrance tests conducted nowadays to filter out the selection. The strict rules of the institute hinder the activities. In one such incident, children from Nankari were relentlessly beaten up by the security while playing in the campus park and were then rescued by one of the volunteers. As of now, passes are issued to permit their entry on the campus. There are several other restrictions imposed on the children including limited roaming and timely departures.",
      "Vijaya didi expressed how things have changed in our society and addressed its negative impacts as well ‚Äì lack of involvement being the most crucial one.",
      "",
      "The Prayas Family-",
      "When Prayas functioned in the Old SAC, various festivals were celebrated together with the students from Apna School and there were unique celebrations arranged for students‚Äô birthdays. These extended to the outdoor stadiums or the auditorium ground, with students jumping around, dancing, and singing their hearts out! Even today, the interaction with students isn‚Äôt limited to studies. Sometimes the team visits their home after classes for dinners and various other festivities.",
      "Vijaya didi addressed the involvement of many faculty members earlier in collaboration with Prayas. Many others had even celebrated their kids‚Äô birthdays with the Prayas‚Äô collective birthday. Unfortunately, these things that used to take place almost monthly, have now subsided.",
      "",
      "Major Milestones achieved-",
      "Some major milestones achieved were regarding awareness about the Right to Education act wherein students coming from financially weak backgrounds are admitted to good private schools for free and provided education through the school funds. One of the volunteers (co-ordinator too), Mukund Mittal, contributed significantly in propagating knowledge of the act. They taught students from classes 3-12, which eventually helped a lot of these students avail the benefits of the act.",
      "Prayas has collaborated with few of the local NGOs over the years for sessions pertinent to personality development, hygiene, and child labour.",
      "A successful session called ‚ÄúHappy Reading‚Äù conducted by one of the NGOs involved sending a large number of books to students to encourage them to read and further exchange those books amongst themselves.",
      "Although, a drawback pertinent to such NGO based collaborations was their agreement to work with Prayas for their name and reputation and for the sake of conducting a session in a prestigious college like IIT Kanpur. Ekta encouraged that such NGO based collaborations shouldn‚Äôt be just one day sessions but must work in the long run to benefit students and help Prayas in its goal of making education attainable to all.",
      "",
      "Redeeming hope in the moments of despair-",
      "Vijaya didi talked about how she often found herself feeling dejected and helpless while thinking about the deprived situation of the children. For instance, whenever young girls (students from Prayas) were forced into situations like marriage, the team visited their homes beforehand to try to stop their families from doing so. Upon this, their fathers justified how they‚Äôre unable to afford their education once they reach the age of 15/16. Regardless, the situation was a saddening one and unfortunately, even such visits couldn‚Äôt put a stopper to child marriage. With time, things changed and now young girls strongly fight for their right to education.",
      "",
      "A walk through Ekta‚Äôs journey in Prayas-",
      "Ekta stepped into Prayas as a replacement volunteer, to substitute for another volunteer for the day. She ended up taking a Drawing class that day wherein one of the students tried to sketch her portrait! This made her realise that if the kids can familiarize themselves with her within a day and can be so enthusiastic to learn despite every setback, then something must be done to mitigate their problems and make them capable enough to work independently in future.",
      "Reciting another such incident, Ekta told us of the time she visited a student‚Äôs place on the new year‚Äôs eve, meeting his family of 5-6 members with both of his parents being labourers. She recalls being extremely discouraged noticing their deprived state and struggle for survival under one shattered roof. All such incidents were disheartening for the entire team but the students‚Äô talents and enthusiasm motivated them to keep going forward!",
      "When asked about how she feels after helping a student, Ekta expressed,‚ÄúSuch a feeling cannot be described in words, but if we draw its comparison to something, it can be the happiness one will get on finally going back to campus after the lockdown.‚Äù",
      "",
      "In the last four years‚Ä¶",
      "In the last four years, the students bolstered their personality and co-curricular skills while simultaneously maintaining their academic performances. As a part of everyday activities, a one hour assembly is conducted wherein they recite poems, enact a drama or tell a story. Progressive changes were observed with time, with students becoming less dependent on the volunteers and starting to analyse things themselves. They now present their self-composed stories, poems and plays conveying social awareness and even targeting women empowerment. The students are improving with each passing day and their learning is notably reflected in their progress.",
      "",
      "",
      "Working and Activities: Pre-COVID",
      "Prayas runs from Monday to Saturday and the working consists of two parts: assembly and academics. In the former, the focus is on personality development and communication. The students are encouraged to prepare songs, stories, drama, etc and perform in front of others. It can even be a math puzzle or some sort of craftwork which is followed by the study sessions. There are many events held throughout the year like Prayas Premier League (PPL), which is a 15 days cricket tournament held during summers. There are separate English classes organized during summers. There is also an annual function where students perform and are given awards and certificates based on discipline and grades. Two major events are Udaan and picnic. On picnic day, the students are taken for a visit to any area in or near Kanpur. Udaan is a ‚Äúmini-galaxy of Prayas‚Äù where many competitions are held. Students are divided into groups and many arts, speaking, story writing competitions, antakshari, etc are organized.",
      "Vijaya didi still visits Prayas once in a while, especially Fridays, but she remains in touch with the students through calls, collective dinners and other means. She attends the meetings once in 3 months and claims that staying connected and united is the only way to lend help to the unfortunate children.",
      "",
      "Functioning in Lockdown-",
      "Ekta remains apprehensive about the proper resumption of activities considering the expected restrictions after campus reopens. Given the hard times, she says they have been in touch with children who have smartphones, through Whatsapp. Junior batches aren‚Äôt much affected with the pandemic‚Äôs straits; the problems imposes for the senior children, who are likely to miss exams, thus affecting their learning schedule significantly.",
      "",
      "Their stories to tell-",
      "Referring to one of her students, namely Sachin, Vijaya didi exclaimed that he is extremely talented and skilled in stand up comedy involving dank humour. He is in twelfth grade and still visits her to learn music. He further plans to pursue it and so she is assisting and providing him with the necessary tangible support. He even helps in the proceedings of Apna School. His parents were adamant to send him for the job of a watchman but she dissuaded considering that he had stunted growth and such a job can prove to be harmful to him.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "When asked about Prayas‚Äô future, Ekta vehemently encouraged all the newer and remaining older members of Prayas to form a better bond with the students in the coming years.",
      "As for her involvement with Prayas, Ekta mentioned that she‚Äôd been taking regular classes in the lockdown while acknowledging the decline in interaction on a personal level. Furthermore, she talked about how Prayas now strives to sponsor the education of some of the children to enable them to thrive and pave the way for a better future.",
      "",
      "Advice to current and future Prayas Members-",
      "Vijaya didi‚Äì",
      "‚ÄúThe spirit to do social good should come from within you. You should have the enthusiasm, the passion to teach and motivation to persuade parents to get their children studying. The present volunteers are doing a marvelous job in managing Prayas and it should continue, although, some human errors are bound to happen, let them not discourage you.‚Äù",
      "Ekta ‚Äì",
      "‚ÄúBe a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô to the students, bond with them. Try visiting their homes every week or so. Understand their struggles and conditions! Keep a strong team bonding with other volunteers as well and try to take new initiatives for the children. I believe that not only Prayas volunteers but all the IITK students should raise awareness amongst the sanitation workers, mess workers, washermen and address various social issues like child marriage, gender bias and lack of education.‚Äù",

      "And undoubtedly for me, it‚Äôs my days at IITK‚Ä¶..",
      "Down those alleys, as I traverse back today, pondering upon how to write this piece of article, I find my conscience confronting me to do justice with this at least, even if you had been so harsh and might have done injustice to yourself, please be a little soft and accepting with this article when needed. I too have many regrets from my journey, who doesn‚Äôt!. But with some achievements, happy memories and with passing time those regrets remain to be just a part of your journey. And yes, despite all those regrets I wish to live this journey again and again, and I guess that‚Äôs the beauty of IITK, you might have cried many times alone in your room, might have wandered alone and depressed in campus, might have sat alone on the rooftop feeling you don‚Äôt deserve to be here but still at the end when the time will be near, you are going to miss this place, those people and that damn room of yours to hell!",
      "Kanpur, being my native place, had always been my childhood summer holiday destination therefore this was not a new place for me. Since I got to know of IITs and one being in Kanpur, I had always dreamt of getting here, and finally, I was here. Unlike many folks I didn‚Äôt talk to any senior about the campus, the life and customs here, call it my carelessness or my overexcitement which made the starting more suspenseful and thrilling. While preparing for JEE, I lost touch with all of my friends, Hard to believe, right? But yes, such was the level of my introversion. So, apart from excelling in academics (I guess everyone plans this here) and being a ‚Äúcore IITian‚Äù in the eyes of society (I will come to this myth of mine in a while) I also planned firmly to be confident and a bit extrovert.",
      "",
      "This place has got so many opportunities, so much to offer, so much to explore, so much to enjoy that I was sure I do not want to miss it and to explore it as much as I could within my realms. I was so excited in the first GBM of Galaxy, raising hands in every event of dramatics, music, and arts that one of the seniors remarked ‚ÄúBus ladki kitna karegi!‚Äù, but definitely this place was bringing out the best of me. Since I had participated in nukkad natak in my freshers‚Äô night, so it was difficult that those people would leave me amidst the number crisis GH always suffers from. Unexpectedly performing in street theatre came out to be my m√©tier. I enjoyed every day of our practice from shouting medleys in the courtyard, making impromptu dialogues in scenes, late-night chai, and paratha, to even those screaming exercises. The final performance gave me chills down my spine, almost everyone in the group cried after bagging the first position! Yeah, finally we did it and that was one hell of a moment I had ever experienced in my life.",
      "",
      "But then there were the times when I became quite afraid of my academics. I feared being involved with extra currics might affect my studies if I am not able to manage well. But trust me you never know till you give it a go! I came up for being the cultural secretary of Hall 6 in my second year and the fourth semester became a mess in the beginning with zeros in quizzes and single-digit marks in mid-semester exams. But more than that, Galaxy became a chaos, and with Veera‚Äôs parade, I saw my failure in managing things. I could have found numerous reasons to console myself, but this experience taught me much more than it disheartened me. It made me stronger enough to at least think of making a lemonade next time when life will offer me lemons! (Let‚Äôs put it this way: Next sem phod denge!)",
      "And then came the real(*not reel) twist in real life when statements like ‚Äúit made me strong enough to handle fuss and ‚Ä¶..‚Äù remained just a statement and that girl who was so confident enough to ‚Äúmake a lemonade next time‚Äù till last semester was here again doubting herself if she can do anything else while handling academics and internship stuff. I opted out the options of every PoR I had on my platter, distanced myself from all my extra currics just to focus on courses and internships. I must confess that the phobia which internships, day 1, day 2, creates can be very disturbing especially for a mediocre person like me. So I decided to try my best for a research internship in the summer of my third year for three reasons. Firstly, I enjoyed structural engineering and wanted to explore it more, secondly, I never wanted to face the SPO sessions of internships, tests, interviews in short such type of competition again, and third and last ‚Äòvidesh ghumne ka sapna‚Äô , C‚Äômon who doesn‚Äôt dream of ? So a research internship fitted best to MY comfort zone. I tried my best, prepared my SoP, apping mail, started reviewing them through seniors, created excel files with all deadlines, profs, colleges to apply to, in summers only. (*A spoiler ahead* ‚Äì Trust me I can spell all fundae to bang a good research internship, but no one ever came to me just because I didn‚Äôt go for any). Fifth Semester started and I applied for all eligible programs on deadline, woke up at odd times so that the mail could reach the professor at the right time. Sixth semester came, the time of people aiming for research internships. Till mid-semester recess, I had nothing in my hand. I went home, and I was so distressed that everyone in the house felt it. This is when I had some conversations with my elder brother and he made me face the questions which I had always been avoiding till now ‚Äì to for once, stop in the flow, come out of your comfort zone and ask yourself what you want to do in life and if the answer is this then rather than being depressed, strive hardly till you achieve it and if the answer is no then take some concrete steps in that another choice. Whatever my answer is/was, those concrete steps could have been taken a summer later, which is a regret I might always hold upon. And honestly, this led to the most difficult time of my stay at IITK. Never had I ever found myself so confused, helpless, and distressed with thoughts reaching a crescendo, knowing that no one is going to help me in taking the final decision, it has to be my call. As if destiny had decided to make me my weakest in forthcoming days ‚Äì rejections in every program, negative replies from professors and while people were getting an internship to different parts of the world, here I was still dreaming one with a confused mindset of ‚Äúwas all those efforts worth? do I really want it?‚Äù. As mostly that ‚ÄòOne day‚Äô comes in every drama film but Alas! In my case that ‚ÄòOne day‚Äô never came. I remember coming back from OIR office after being informed that I have been rejected, with tears rolling down my eyes as I was struggling hard so that no one would see me like this. I remember breaking down on the phone while talking to parents when it hit hard that I was going nowhere next summer. I remember crying alone in my room after switching off the lights so that everyone would think I am asleep. True that our mind doesn‚Äôt have a switch button to shut off the dreams one have been watching and working for so long but when you can be so close to achieving it one should not let go and think of other options when things don‚Äôt work out, which I think I did and a decision of mine which I will regret long. That semester was the toughest and undoubtedly this got reflected in my grades from constant SPI‚Äôs of 9.6 to 7.6.",
      "",
      "I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by so many good people who always helped and motivated me in every decision of mine and thankfully saved me from that terrible mental state I was going through. This place can be brutal enough sometimes to kill you from inside but trust me you just need to GO and TALK to people, no one will ever get a dream that you are so disturbed or stressed out, you yourself have to approach someone to help yourself!",
      "Finally, I decided to omit the option of a research internship, stopped mailing, and started preparing for the Engineering Services Examination in summers. All this might sound like ‚ÄúI took the one less traveled by‚Äù but is the road right or not? Future holds. The decision was tough, but life‚Äôs not about making the right decisions every time and while penning down this phase I realize that the dysphoria of ‚ÄòI wish I hadn‚Äôt done that‚Äô has its own charm. But trust me(from a fourth-year undergraduate who is about to leave the campus) it‚Äôs OK if you choose some unconventional way of spending your ‚ÄúTHE third year summers‚Äù, but be sure you are happy and satisfied while deciding it, things will ultimately fall into place, they always do!",
      "After this intern dilemma, placement was no more a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna face‚Äù situation for me.",
      "I cocooned myself so much in my third year for improving my CPI, preparing a good curriculum vitae to get a good research internship that I distanced myself from all the extra currics I had been involved with or I wish to be involved with or the things I enjoyed doing. I always wished to perform in stage play but never went to because I ‚Äúthought‚Äù that would be time-consuming, wanted to go for that one POR but didn‚Äôt go for, just to focus more on the plans of internship, and today four years down the line as I sit today to revive my journey the regret of letting go all those things I wished for and enjoyed doing, for the sake of courses and CPI is much much more than the satisfaction which those A*‚Äôs or those papers gave me.",
      "I will never advise any freshman to keep aside academics and do whatever you enjoy doing, academic is and should be an integral part of your stay at IITK and to manage it should always be your priority but please never be that harsh on yourself that you lose upon the things you wish to do and more importantly the real you while managing it!",
      "How can I end this piece without mentioning my all-time constants throughout this journey of ups and downs? As perfect as I wanted these lines for them to be, more than perfect were those unproductive bulla sessions, Pictionary and trip plannings on the whiteboard ( I bought it with firm determination to use it productivelyüòõ), game of cards, sometimes much ‚Äúnot needed‚Äù chai in the canteen, late-night walks, and talks, unplanned trips, pranks, wait for those endearing bunch of people who would call me ‚ÄòAmma!!‚Äô, every interaction with them and the list goes on‚Ä¶.

      "It sometimes scares me to remember how close I came to abandoning my seat in IITK for Medical College. I knew early on that I wanted to do something in biology and figured that medicine was better than classical engineering disciplines. In the end, thanks to my mom‚Äôs foresight, I confirmed my JOSAA allocation 10 minutes before the registration deadline! I had realised that BSBE at IITK would indeed be a more holistic experience for me, and I haven‚Äôt regretted that decision since.",
      "The Guinea Pig",
      "That said, given my high expectations, my experience on a biology research-track in IITK was sort of disappointing. While most UGs have a clear plan about what they want to achieve in their time here (be it core or non-core), there are a large number who are searching for their passion and trying to decide their future careers. I believe that each department should actively try to inspire passion for their field in these undecided students. However, in reality, even the few of us who enter with interest end up questioning this direction (and occasionally giving up on it). Personally, in my department, I have seen the apathetic attitude of some professors towards UG courses and UG students generally. This is extremely demoralizing. There are of course some gems: Profs teaching good courses and being great mentors. But they are the exception, not the rule. So, what you end up seeing is four years of students and professors half-heartedly getting through the course syllabus. During my time as the student nominee of the DUGC, I actively worked with my batchmates to open a dialogue with our professors about our suggestions for improving the department.",
      "",
      "On the bright side, I really appreciate the broad foundation one can obtain in the sciences, with all the courses and academic flexibility we have at IITK. The exposure to different opportunities is another huge plus of the IIT environment. During my first semester, I attended a talk by a professor who worked on using information theory in biology. I was so intrigued that I missed 2 hours of my first Antaragni talking to him after the lecture! This interest in ‚Äòtheory for biology‚Äô lay dormant in the back of my mind over the next two years. By the third year, I was slowly beginning to doubt the idea of a career in research. What I was learning wasn‚Äôt boring me, but I wasn‚Äôt too keen on the type of research I saw around me. I attended a workshop in Bangalore (heard about it from a departmental announcement email) and got to talking with a professor who gave a talk there. He was impressed by our exchange and offered me a summer internship at his lab in Harvard. Working in a quantitative biology lab helped me realise that I was more inclined to a line of research that was theory driven (I am now about to begin a Masters in Biophysics!). It‚Äôs only in hindsight that these steps are clear, but I am glad I didn‚Äôt lose hope and settle for anything unsatisfactory but kept trying to find a line I would be passionate about doing for the rest of my life.",
      "The Cuckoo",
      "Coming to U.P. was a big step and a huge culture shock for me. Goa is a relatively more Westernized place, Hindi is taught in schools but not commonly spoken. Life in the Hindi heartland of India took some serious getting used to. Growing up, I was always a self-confident child and never had a problem expressing myself. But in my first year, my inability to speak fluent Hindi was a major source of anxiety for me. People used to call me ‚Äústuck-up‚Äù and ‚ÄúELS wala ****‚Äù for only speaking in English, not understanding that it was out of helplessness. I was always missing out on jokes, Bollywood references in conversations; getting mocked by people for my odd manner of speaking; irritating people when I needed them to repeat themselves. Early on, I was only comfortable interacting with people in English and I tried to avoid conversations in Hindi. But this prevented me from improving. It took a lot of encouragement from my wingies and other friends to get over this insecurity. Speaking to strangers in Hindi helped a lot: because it was less embarrassing, and they were less likely to switch to English. Apart from improving my vocabulary, I needed to build confidence and aim to be understood without worrying about correct grammar.",
      "",
      "For many of us, college is the first time we are living away from home and loneliness is now an ever-present possible fate. I developed a sort of ‚Äúoutsider complex‚Äù, which stemmed from the linguistic and cultural differences but also my own insecurities and peculiarities. I began to see myself as a fringe element in all the domains of my life, being a part of so many social-circles and endeavours but never feeling like an integral part of any. Now, looking back I see that it wasn‚Äôt entirely imagined. I tried to juggle too many interests. Finding the correct balance wasn‚Äôt trivial and included dropping things a few times along the way (don‚Äôt be a butterfly flitting from one pursuit to another but do step away from those that aren‚Äôt good for you). I used to sometimes look around at people forming these perfect friendships, and wonder, what do they know that I don‚Äôt. The lesson is (cliched but true): you need to understand yourself before you can be truly comfortable with others. To illustrate, I want to use the metaphor of your life being like a jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle pieces represent your friends, your work, your hobbies or any aspect of your life. You start at the corners and try to build the whole picture. The central pieces must thus fit the most perfectly with all the surrounding domains. A common mistake we can make is attempting to break/change a piece when trying to fit it into the wrong place in the bigger picture, or worse, trying to change the entire picture to better match ‚Äúimportant‚Äù pieces. In times of turmoil it‚Äôs important to realise that it‚Äôs okay if your puzzle pieces change or you lose some, you can always re-do the whole picture, potentially making one that‚Äôs even better!",

      "Campus is a place where you are truly free to try anything you want, both in academics and hobbies. Whether it was academics, table-tennis, music, wall-climbing, or even CS:GO ‚Äì the experience of putting in effort and seeing the payoff can be a source of happiness or disappointment. But I have learnt and grown from it all either way. Given the interesting people around you and the endless nature of the internet, I think it is easy to not be bored, but it is easy to get sucked into addictions (so try to be moderate). Life in these four years has been special in that we hadfreedom with almost no responsibilities(I am sure we will never experience this again). Barring extreme cases, it is hard for any whimsical pursuit to have any permanent negative repercussions. Explore stuff to your heart‚Äôs content!",
      "The two best things IITK will do for you: give you a platform from where you can access a lot of opportunities and a peer group of the highest caliber. When I say that people on campus are interesting, it‚Äôs not just the things they do and the interests they have; I have completely opened my eyes to the wide ranges of backgrounds people come from and how you can never assume to know Their Story. On the other hand, it‚Äôs amazing how you can find people you resonate with so well even though you‚Äôve had very different upbringings. Over the last four years I have made friends hailing from Tamil Nadu to Kashmir, Punjab to Assam. For a small town boy it has been a grand experience in broadening my horizons.",
      "IITK was the place where I really grew into myself. It was humbling and eye-opening at every step. No matter the thing you are interested in, there is probably someone around who is an expert, you just have to find these low-profile geniuses. For common pursuits you of course have clubs to bring together fellow enthusiasts.",
      "",
      "My time in the music club was loads of fun: it‚Äôs where I made a ton of new friends, learned to appreciate new dimensions of music, and developed a richer music taste. Although I eventually quit playing the guitar, I‚Äôm glad I was once a part of the M-Club. Quiz Club always seemed to draw a bunch of interesting characters (met most of my non-Y16 friends here). It was great to be around people who enjoyed the same pursuit of figuring out the fundae. I‚Äôm glad I got to be a coordinator along with my friends. I feel like we could have been more ambitious in our overall goals for the club (even though the Nihilanth trips weren‚Äôt fruitful per se, we had tons of fun). From bingeing Naruto in the first semester, to co-founding the Anisoc Quiz that people have loved, anime has grown to be a big part of my life (more recently, manga and webcomics too). And I kid you not, I have bonded with some of my favorite people over the shared love of anime! My friends and I started playing Counter-Strike regularly in second year, it is now one of my hobbies that I am most passionate about. We have started an E-Sports hobby group and I hope that community grows in the coming years!",
      "I still fondly remember the early days of playing with my wingies, on LAN, all crammed together in one room, waiting till 8am for Sunday morning dosa. Exploring the entire campus during midnight walks with the best people. Special kulfi was a must-have if you needed to just chill. All those awesome meals shared with various gangs of friends, although chai-pakoda at MT after a night-out is a mood, not a meal. Bitching and commiserating with your fellow sufferers about the unfair world is a number one bonding method. I loved how you could bump into a friend after ages and chat the night away. Nothing beats the adrenaline rush of starting to study a few hours before a paper and then meeting another friend who is in the same boat.",

      "Looking back it‚Äôs easier to make sense of all that happened in the last four years, the good, the bad, and the ugly. But I am happy with the way things have turned out. IITK very soon became a home away from home and it hurts to leave, especially in such an unceremonious fashion. As one tends to do, I‚Äôd like to end with a quote from my favourite author:",
      "‚ÄúAnd so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.‚Äù",

      "‚ÄúMumma wake me up when the IIT gate comes, I don‚Äôt wanna miss a glimpse of my Mecca Madina!‚Äù Yes, foolishly enough, that‚Äôs what I told my Mumma once when we were coming from outstation and passing Kalyanpur. That‚Äôs how I dreamt of entering IITK, being akanpuriyaand having visited the campus beforehand.",
      "Disclaimer: All the incidents in this episode are entirely real, and any resemblance to a person is purely intentional. This account of my journey through the 4 years of campus life (sadly reduced to 3.5 years) is based on personal experiences. A lot of lives were touched andharmedwith attachment and love during its creation.",
      "Something I made up while in college, but that‚Äôs exactly how I feel now about leaving college. Well, I would only be presenting those fragments of the journey from which you can draw a lesson, for others hold no more significance than my desire to blabber.",
      "",
      "Point# 1: My constant",
      "For some, it might be a romantic interest, but for me, my constant was academics. For all, I knew then and still am firm with the belief that all other things stood secondary to academics for me. It was more of an increasing curve, starting with an 8.7, and moving on to a 9.6 was a journey that saw a lot of hard work and perseverance. But it doesn‚Äôt imply I was cut off from everyone, but yes, I had to decide and manage time, which I am still learning.",
      "But once, when my amma while reviewing my resume, said thatTeri CPI itni badh gyi‚Äò, then it hit me: yes I had worked hard and what seemed unachievable wasn‚Äôt really. If I could do it, then I think anyone can do it with just two tools: hard work and sincerity.",
      "Point# 2: My love: my department",
      "This might not make much sense to some, but yeah, I am proud to be a Civil Engineer. It didn‚Äôt begin this way, for the whole first year I wanted a branch change to electrical but could not get one. Hence I was trying to make my peace with the department when I met a senior who in the true meaning of the word ‚Äòintroduced‚Äô me to the beauty of Civil engineering. Then I embraced my branch with a positive attitude, which I feel is very important when you are starting something new. Second-year onwards, I did not study the courses to get grades but to feel the subject if you call it; believe me or not, it really works.",
      "I felt it was my duty to at least reduce, if not end, the negative-cheering of Civil Engineering, most of which happens due to lack of knowledge about the department. In my first year, I never knew that I would be a part of the team involved in reviving the long-lost Society of Civil Engineers (SOCE) and end up becoming its coordinator. But for now, I take nothing but pride in being so closely related to my department and loving it dearly.",
      "Takeaway: GIVE IT A CHANCE!! I know it is a bit old-school but, try to see everything positively, and not just feel the label of ‚ÄòMajdoor‚Äò or ‚ÄòKam-a-kal‚Äò or any other branch, tagged to you as a negative one, just give your department a chance. If you don‚Äôt like it, then be it, but give it a chance and believe me, you have a hell lot of time to do so.",
      "Point# 3: My rollercoaster ride",
      "This one is especially interesting, for it shackled my forever belief in ‚ÄòPlanning things ahead.‚Äô I had chosen IITK for its academically rigorous curriculum. In my second year, I took up extra projects in the department, did field training, etc. to fully explore all fields before choosing. There was even a time at the beginning of my third year when I was sure of doing a Ph.D. at the least. But then I analyzed many aspects slowly with time and tried to see myself on the other side of the teaching table. All this went on for long and side by side the struggle to apply for research internships, taking out time to write emails to professors, waiting in anticipation, filling numerous program applications, and finally ending up getting the Honda YES Award. That interview was rough and honestly, I had no hopes. I also did my winter intern at IISc, which made things clearer. I realized that I was not really interested in becoming a professor, which seemed to be a role way bigger for me, since I‚Äôm not sure if I could ever be prepared to take a class. This view might change later, but for now, I am very sure of it.",
      "Since I had a good academic record, I decided to stop on the research path and have job experience for now. I sat for the placements, ended up getting placed in American Express, and am really looking forward to the job now. And believe me, your confidence and your profile matter a lot in the interviews. For those who have time, please work on your profile. But don‚Äôt take the wrong impression here, for those in their last year, please prepare well for placements. Having been through the season, I have seen preparation do wonders for people.",
      "Takeaway: HAVE PATIENCE AND GIVE IT A THOUGHT! It‚Äôs okay if things don‚Äôt go as planned, it‚Äôs okay if you change your mind at the last moment, it‚Äôs never too late to try something out. Just analyze everything thoroughly, and as long as you keep working sincerely for the(t)time of your life, things at(t+t)shall fall in place and for beyond you really don‚Äôt know.",
      "Point# 4: Clubs, PORs?",
      "Now it may seem to you that I am a person who sees nothing but the four walls of her room or the library but wait till the end. From the very beginning, thanks to my love for public speaking, I became a part of Hindi Sahitya Sabha. From performing in the fresher‚Äôs to participating in Galaxy, this club was a place I always looked forward to until I got busy with the department.",
      "It‚Äôs not that I had given up Electronics totally at once, I was involved with the ‚ÄòBatticlub‚Äô for some time and made some friends who would last for a lifetime. The fun of participating in Techkriti in the first year, doing crazy things, full night outs in the LHC foyers, looking for a place to work, with loads of Odomos; the summer from getting our friend bald to changing the project topic on the last night, those are one of the best memories to look back to.",
      "",
      "Talking of PORs, I really only had one major responsibility, the one for SOCE, which I did solely out of my will and not at all for the sake of resume filling.",
      "Takeaway: EXPLORE!! The number of opportunities you get here would never come back, and it‚Äôll be only wise to use them for your good. And don‚Äôt miss the chance to have fun here. But don‚Äôt do it at the stake of your academics, for you‚Äôll never get that back either.",
      "Point# 5: No interaction? All work and no play?",
      "Well, I‚Äôm neither Jack nor dull. So yeah, it was not all work and no play. I really had a minimal number of friends before college, and here, it so was that I did make a lot of friends, some I could count on at any hour of the night and through the lowest points in my life. The random walks at night, exploring every single place on campus, being called the‚Äòamma‚Äôof the group, and every single moment that made my life special is mainly due to all the people I met here.",
      "",
      "I shared the 4am talks with my wingies back at GH, till the last semester. Trips were planned and cancelled every single weekend, throwing tantrums at each other, yet always sitting back to listen to even the long-distance calls to vent out our summer frustration. Add in the long lost-and-found friends from the 10th standard. From stopping the cycle in the middle of the road staring at the moon, to dancing on the roads on ‚ÄòJumma Chumma‚Äò to having the last momo together before this exile, I am gonna miss each and every one of you.",
      "Some of the seniors I met here are now my permanent family, and thanks to Hindi Sahitya Sabha for that. Can‚Äôt imagine how campus life would have been without you. You all just made everything easier and smoother, and every time I needed any advice or just an ear to listen, I knew I had someone. Then becoming the SG amma was not only a responsibility but also an experience that helped me grow and bond with a whole lot of new people. Helping out mybachchisin their problems helped in introspecting too. And not to forget the wonderful orientation of Y17 where we had to wake up earlier than thebachcheand guide them through all, long hours and a lot of labour but only to be neutralized by the fun we all had as a team.",
      "",
      "The department labs with hours of toiling on the ground and playing with cement and soil also gave me great friends. How could have I lived through those torturous labs without you people? The constant discussions on our career plans, sitting on the stage of L20, and then living through the summer heat. The SOCE people, me becoming the bad cop always, I am so gonna miss those scolding sessions.",
      "How can I forget the Antaragni group, being called the busiest in the group, an extinct animal who only shows up on fests. Really, those 4 days of Antaragni were just 100% fun with lack of sleep and endlessbaratidance. From Pepsi to thedulha-dulhanof IITK, I will miss all the fun I had.",
      "",
      "I cannot end this without talking about the role of the professors in my life. Some of the department faculties really helped out when I saw a dead end. Anytime I needed advice on be it acads, on career or on life in general, I could knock on a door and get in. From solving all my major issues to being available as a mentor, I would really thank them for always being there for me. Do not dread the faculty members; remember, they are just us plus years of experience. Plus, they don‚Äôt bite!",
      "Takeaway: MAKE FRIENDS!! You‚Äôll never end up enjoying life as much as you can in these 4 years, you‚Äôll never be so looked after, and you‚Äôll never meet so many like-minded people. Just come out of your rooms and talk to people, make friends! Take home people you know well and who know you well when you leave college.",
      "Conclusion: The most important thing, time is infinite, but only if you manage it well. The number of things I did were only possible because I managed time well and did the right things at the right time (that includes ‚Äòliving‚Äô the campus life). But remember, do not follow anyone‚Äôs template, make your own, no matter how foolish it might seem to others (as long as it‚Äôs not jumping off a cliff), follow it, customize it at every step, and re-follow. Make mistakes, learn from them, spend some time with yourself, with your friends, live like this time‚Äôs never coming back and obviously whatever you do, ‚Äòsab chill hai!‚Äô",

      "Since I have been told that this article is for ‚Äòfuture me‚Äô where I would look at it as a ten year old memory,¬† let‚Äôs make it a good and funny one because we never know ‚Äì maybe this article will make me laugh after I write it, as I am smiling now thinking of my old decisions andharkate.",
      "Well, it feels a little funny writing ‚ÄòAs We Leave‚Äô considering the way we leave IITK‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but still while looking at the memories stored as pictures of my last 4 years in IITK, I feel a bit nostalgic and want to go back to campus to relive my four years in a month.",
      "Like most of the students, I didn‚Äôt know what I want to do in life and what are all the options I can have. So I did what is obvious: Become an IITian and decide later. I always believed that in a great company, you learn and grow, and IIT was one of those great platforms. But my rank didn‚Äôt support me here and I was hoping my best to get into the old IITs. But, realistically, there was almost no chance for me, but suddenly there was news that a new department opened at IITK and I just hopped onto that bus, because the only thing that mattered to me was the rich environment and culture of the old IITs. Sadly, it has been disrupted very badly and I no longer feel that one should now get admitted to IITK for its culture.",
      "Firstly, some words of wisdom. We all face problems in life in some way or another. Like many uncertain and devastating situations came in my life such as the increase in difficulty level of JEE paper (I guess XD), fee hike, suspension, news of Modiji actually coming to IITK 1 week before Techkriti, and finally COVID-19 which obviously will make me scream.",
      "",
      "But due to the huge support and guidance of my friends & family and the motto of life that ‚Äòbe happy because that‚Äôs the ultimate thing we are working for and take this experience for your betterment‚Äô, my response will always be ‚Ä¶",
      "",
      "So keep this line always in your mind. With emphasis onGhanta!",
      "My journey at IIT Kanpur:",
      "I saw this very beautiful campus and began my journey. Then started freshers night selections and my journey of affiliation with dance club started there (and will continue for rest of my life :)) Then came the chance of representing IITK in Dance Competition, for a freshie that thing was quite fascinating, but many seniors I met told me not to go in the Dance Club or the Drams Club because they both are time taking and would affect my CPI. But I didn‚Äôt listen to them because my dream from childhood was to dance and because of which I continued with the club. At the end of the first semester, I realized that all those claims of my seniors were wrong because there were many people around me who were not involved in anything but still managed to waste time doing nothing and landed with low CPI. This taught me one thing about me, that I am able to manage my time better when I have lots of things on my plate. Because then I could think that since I spent my time on other things, I should utilize my leftover time for studies. But I will not encourage others to do the same; you just try finding what works best for you as this kind of funda worked best for me. Also, we had night outs during antaragni dance practice, which was first of a kind experience for me. All those methods of seniors giving Chai ‚Äì paratha to juniors for working all night long.",
      "",
      "Then, at the end of the second semester, I wanted to become a student guide, but my cpi was not supporting it. So I did what we commonly hear from our seniors:Enthu dhikhao enthu,and it helped. I remember the way I projected my enthu to the interviewer by saying that ‚Äúeven if I am not selected as SG, let me learn those skills taught to SG‚Äôs for handling freshies!‚Äô Luckily, they made me one and that experience of guiding six freshies, and being part of the orientation was an epic journey.",
      "Let me tell you a story related to an encounter between me and DOSA. So, there I was taking a selfie in the washroom mirror, and DOSA Sir came from the back and started clapping and laughing while saying what a place for a selfie. Wait ‚Ä¶. I am talking about A R Harish sir, during my first year, in OAT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what did you think of, huh?!",
      "Well the bigger incident happened in my 3rdsemester when I was suspended and my 3rdsemester was scraped. Thank God, because that sem was really not going well. After returning in 4thsemester my friends welcomed me and everyone was there to help me out. But the thought of knowing that I am lagging by one semester haunted me, which made me realize that I have to take maximum credits to complete my degree on time. Well, I worked hard then, getting my courses done, accompanied with all the extracurricular activities I wanted to do. I remember people telling me to not do extracurricular and what not because I had 4.6 SPI in my 4thsemester. But the faith of my friends and families made me go through all those hurdles and made me complete my degree in 7 semesters. Not only I took 60 plus credits each sem but also accompanied them with the responsibility of Placements and Head, Techkriti. I want to tell all those who take the tension of their low CPI and think that they cannot score a good intern or placement. Well buddy believe in yourself, because if you follow your own path and do what you like, you can bang a good intern or placement. Those numbers written in the resume are worth close to nothing. People keep saying that keep your CPI above 7 to get a good placement, but this is false. You should not worry if your CPI is below 7, because you can still get a good placement. The main thing that I realised in this game is that, cpi doesn‚Äôt matter that much, but the thing that matters is that you have proved yourself in something or another.",
      "Then there was Team Techkriti. My involvement in Techkriti since the return after the suspension has kept me busy and gave new directions to my life. This one word ‚Äì ‚ÄòTechkriti‚Äô has impacted my life a lot. Not only it refined me more but also gave me a great family of friends and memories which I will cherish all my life. This is one thing that kept me sane during the internship season, because if I were not in Techkriti wing in Hall 1, then all the nonsense that goes around during the internship season would have driven me nuts. The thing I see there is that the pressure of not getting an intern and all doesn‚Äôt come from self. Instead it comes from people around you who keep crying. And my involvement in Techkriti really helped me shift that focus and since I only gave little time in preparing for intern, there was no time for crying about not scoring one but instead look at it rationally and do the suffice. Therefore I would suggest you all too to not stress on the fact that whether you will get a good intern or placement but rather look at it rationally and do the needful, because you never know what‚Äôs waiting for you there and how some events are going to affect your life. So just chill!!",
      "I have no regrets with my college life‚Ä¶. I literally lived it to the fullest and when I look at the old pictures, I see a lot of happy memories, since we don‚Äôt click the bad ones, so I am left with happy ones only‚Ä¶ It was really wonderful to meet such awesome people and do so many crazy things. Cheers to all those friends who stood beside me no matter what the situation was, to those teachers who were always there to help, to those juniors & seniors who made this journey more awesome. I could have not asked for more. Adios Amigo!!",
      "‚Ä¶.Here‚Äôs to the ones that we gotCheers to the wish you were here,but you‚Äôre not‚ÄòCause the drinks bring back all thememoriesOf everything we‚Äôve been through‚Ä¶.",

      "I‚Äôll let you know about my journey at IITK so that one may (preferably not) resonate. I joined in July 2016 and will graduate hopefully by 2020. In the meantime, I spent 9 months of summer and 3 months of winter being extremely (un) productive at my house.I didn‚Äôt opt for intern or placements or any undergraduate research and stuff, nor was I into extra-curriculars. You might be questioning my existence by now, so let me address that. I‚Äôm one of them (Apparently).",
      "1st year was bliss, from sessions at ‚ÄúQuad‚Äù to whining during exams to hiding in under construction Hall 12 washrooms and covert missions on Hall 11 rooftops. We had our times that we‚Äôre not proud of. Come 2nd Year, and reality dawned upon us with our horrible CPI‚Äôs that was to get worse in the meantime.",
      "",
      "Then, there was enlightenment(Courtesy: my roomie) that our (engineering) scope is limited, unlike our demands and ambitions. So, I started with my efforts for (un)conventional endeavors here spanning various dimensions like spirituality, academics, etc. However, the main thing that I‚Äôd like to narrate and vouch for is relationships.

      "They are your lifelines!Then we have acquaintances. In my case, they constitute the majority. Recently, to help me out with a task, an acquaintance of mine did something for which I had to wipe off my social media. It was not just on his part, and I had a fair share of trust in him even after his mess-ups. The same guy saved me from a backlog in my second year, which was solely my doing.",
      "Hence came the (sad or happy) involvement into an unconventional career choice. The choice warranted significant reading. Consequently, I spent my 2nd and 3rd year, mostly studying in the library, all alone.Now it may sound pathetic, but it helped me develop my reading skills as it involved reading books ranging from academics to Neil Strauss‚Äôs ‚ÄúGame‚Äù to whatever I felt like(No judgments please). I was engaged in books to the extent I preferred to read rather than doing anything else. A strange occurrence, but immensely beneficial.",
      "",
      "Now the question is, is it wrong to be secluded from everything that is conventionally established as a fun activity and engage in something as dull as ‚Äúreading‚Äù?Perhaps not.",
      "Yes, it felt strange at times that I‚Äôm not involved in anything, I don‚Äôt like to party in the general sense, and I don‚Äôt tend to engage with people (even friends!). What‚Äôs going on in my life! Why am I alive? Such thoughts eventually faded off with time. In retrospect, I can say with absolute conviction that I enjoyed every bit of it: The strange moments, wondering if I‚Äôll succeed or not, breaking down the dogma of enjoyment, of fun, of relaxation, of chilling out, over mugging in the library!",
      "No problem, that‚Äôs my way of life.",

      "It is absolutely perfect and joyful to embrace solidarity if you happen to enjoy that. Moreover, it helps the much-needed retrospection that enhances clarity of mind, giving directions in the seemingly infinite potentialities. That wasmycase in point, though.",
      "You‚Ä¶you‚Äôll find yours! Relish the anxiety and thank the almighty for the struggle in disguise! However, to convince you that I am no alien species,I was back into all the (fun) stuff in my final year.

      "Over the past several months, with the pandemic looming over the entire world, the hopes of enjoying the last semester at IITK also got dashed. I was hoping for IITK to reopen soon and let me have those last few golden days again and was desperately looking forward to the last bulla session, the most awaited photoshoot, the exciting football matches, the last meal at Barbecue Nation and millions of other things. Maybe, it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be. While writing this article, I became nostalgic thinking about the wait I sensed four years ago. I was excited but as they say ‚Äúnew place always troubles‚Äù, so I‚Äôm a bit tense as well.",
      "With a good enough JEE rank and MnC as my branch, B318 Hall2 was the place where I first landed. The first two days were really tough but soon I got accommodated as the orientation program proceeded and Harlem shake marked my first wing interaction. Attending lectures at the huge L7, getting up on Saturday mornings for the coolest CPA ‚ÄúNCC‚Äù, attending GBMs started my journey at IITK, definitely memorable. For those who don‚Äôt know me, I am an extrovert, and I am seldom found alone in my room. Soon I made some great friends, didn‚Äôt realize they would become an integral part of my life by the end of these four years. This is something I wish to tell to the coming generations of IIT Kanpur, that the person sitting next to you might be way more interesting than games and movies on your laptop. So don‚Äôt simply sit inside your room, go out and explore as many things as you can.",
      "B318 was not a triple-sharing room anymore but accommodated a lot more than that, and thus became home to the best memories of my life. Not even over were the night outs of takneek, and fights in inferno, when the midsems came. Libraries filled with students on and off the chair. I recall how upset the hall was after the MTH101 mid sem marks. However, this feeling of despair didn‚Äôt last long when Antaragni brought with it its energy, the euphoria that could blow away anyone‚Äôs mind. Excited to work in a fest, I started as a hospitality volunteer in Antragani, and later on as an MnP executive in techkriti. This is when I found MnP was the most appropriate place for me, and so I continued working as an MnP executive in E-Cell and later on as a manager in Antaragni.",
      "The Second year started with a major setback. Many of my friends with whom I used to hang out with most of the time were suspended. One from the left, and one from the right of my room, it was a quite depressing time. The complete spirit of our hall and maybe of the whole campus was demolished. Friends who were a part of my routine from the last one year, who used to accompany me to the lecture halls, canteen, and OAT suddenly disappeared. That was a tough time for me,but soon I comprehended that it‚Äôs not the time for me to cry, some of my closest friends needed support. After a couple of months, I realized, there will always be ‚Äútough times‚Äù, at every stage of your life, but positivity is the key.Perhaps try to find solutions by yourself or try reaching out to your people, talk to them and if nothing works, just hit the pause button and let it sink in.",
      "This incident made me learn a lot and made me believe that ‚Äútough times don‚Äôt last, tough people do‚Äù. I was lucky enough to have amazing friends, and in the coming years, all of us realized that discussing problems helped a lot. The next semester started on a low, with less number of friends. It included two torturing math courses and one grade drop for no fault of mine. The questions kept popping inside our heads, why the MTH courses and grading policies were not like other departments. I, along with many of my friends were at a stage where we were retrospecting our decision of taking the MnC branch. But that misconception was soon cleared in the coming years. During this semester, I, along with two of my friends organized the Hall-2 Football League. I used to play football regularly but this tournament was the path that led to the great football family I have at IITK. I can‚Äôt remember a single game that ended without a fight, but the fights only lasted till the match was not over. There was a time when we were so engrossed in football that despite playing in IFL and other institute tournaments, we used to have tournaments with different halls, and even with Y15 of our own hall.Football was something that I loved and it always kept me engaged.This institute provides ample facilities and one of the best campuses in India, and so try as many new clubs or sports you can, and then finally find something that you enjoy a lot or makes you feel good. Learn new things, discover your hidden talents, or explore something that diverts or relaxes you during tough times. For me playing football did the same thing.",
      "",
      "The third-year started with everyone focusing on internships. I was not well prepared and that completely reflected on my tests. Quite upset, but I was glad that I had friends to discuss my problems with. That incident taught me many things, better time management, how to handle things maturely when nothing goes your way, and a lot more. It was at the end of the fifth semester that we decided to study in groups. These group study sessions were a huge success and thus resulted in almost every group member scoring a nine pointer in the sixth semester. These group study lessons had a special place in our hearts and so we named these as ‚ÄúRaids‚Äù. These sessions were a gem for students who were last-minute readers. It then continued, and during the seventh semester around half of the MnC batch was studying together in a single room.",
      "",
      "Not even over with the summer internships, started the placement semester. One of the most paramount things, why a teenager works hard to get into an IIT is due to its amazing placements. Most of my friends were either notoptingfor the placements or had received a Pre Placement Offer. I still remember the times, when despite receiving a Pre-placement offer, some of my friends used to give tests with me, so that I continued working hard. Soon giving those company tests became a habit for the next two months, and NCL became my workplace. But that was just the trailer, the real pressure scenario started just one week before the interviews, with around twelve of my friends sitting with me the day before the interviews started. I still remember, they distributed themselves to various panels so that I don‚Äôt miss a single interview due to clashes. Exhausted after lots of interviews in a single slot, I went back to the room with two of my friends, the rest of them still outside the panel. After a couple of hours, the interviewer came outside and was so delighted to see so many people waiting for the result of just one. Finally, I got placed at Myntra, and the interviewer called me and said ,‚ÄúCongratulations! We are really very happy to see that you have great friends.‚Äù That day I realized, the most important thing the college gave me was great friends and they would last forever. Despite all the struggles that MnC gave us, one realizes that it‚Äôs worth every bit of it during the internship and placement sessions.",
      "",
      "I am not graduating with a great CPI, or huge POR‚Äôs but yeah, these four years at IITK have changed me to a great extent. The teenager entering B-318 of Hall 2 and the adult leaving A118, Hall1 are two completely different people. Everything has changed, the mindset, the maturity level, way to handle things, and much more. I still recall the question we were asked during our first GBM, what‚Äôs the difference between a normal college and IITs? True, IITs have great facilities and even exposure, but the most important thing is the students who get into IITs. The students here make this institution great. You are surrounded by thebrightest and sharpest minds of your age group. Interact with them, you can learn a lot from them.",
      "Whenever I discuss these four years at IITK, I can count thousands of mistakes I made, but yeah this is how you learn. Everyone makes mistakes, but it depends on how you handle them, how fast you learn not to repeat those mistakes. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to make a mistake as long as you learn something from it.",
      "The last sem on campus has a completely different environment. Everyone is trying to live these last four months as much as they can. Hall-1 is filled with all sorts of emotions, everyone trying to relive these four years. Soon the countdown began, with 100 days left, but we never knew it would be so much less than that. It was the 8th of March, excited for the goa trip- locked my room, but never realized these might be my final moments in this beautiful journey. And this is the thing that hurts my batch the most, we didn‚Äôt receive a chance to say a proper goodbye.",

      "There‚Äôs this part of me that still wants to rush to the canteen at 2 AM, hoping to get that last plate of Maggi on a cold winter night. It wants to go to those boring lectures just to mark the attendance. It wants to relive those many night outs eating Kathi rolls shouting war cries for my randomly allocated hall in those inter hall events. This part of me wants to do all those silly little things with all those stupid hilarious people (aka friends) one more time.",
      "This place provides each one of us with small little shells in the form of clubs, hobby groups, teams, and even wings. There‚Äôs this warm comfort of just being with people we love in a collective space that we all genuinely consider our own. Now, I understand that these shells aren‚Äôt something everyone embraces equally. Suppose you are the introvert type (as most of us are when we arrive here). In that case, it‚Äôs totally understandable that you‚Äôd find most of it quite overwhelming. But even then, I imagine you‚Äôd also have a tiny cocoon of easily accessible, litmus tested, comforting people around you.",
      "One such comforting friend of mine said a thing that has been with me since. We had been strolling around the campus for hours and finally decided to gaze at the night sky, hanging our legs from the rooftop of the beautiful OAT. Breaking the silence, he said,‚ÄúBhai, bas 6 aur weeks hain hum yaha!‚Äù. It might sound overwhelming, but I was numb for a moment. I was numb because it induced an epiphany. I realized that our lives are filled with ‚ÄúI should have..‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if I did..‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs it too late?‚Äù like contemplations.",
      "Of course, each one of us has a long list of things we wished we did: some more bulla sessions with our beloved wingies, a little more effort in that midsem, a better sleep schedule, not procrastinating, and whatnot. It is easy to crush ourselves under the weight of our own insecurities. Lying on the bed, cluelessly looking at those insecurities dripping through the wretched ceiling, we often feel that it‚Äôs too late. That somehow others are better, more successful. Also because there‚Äôs a peculiar thing about this place. There is no particular carved out path to success here. Everyone seems to be following a different route and somehow improving and moving ahead from where they are.",
      "This place changes the notion of distance. The people closest to you seem like the ones farthest too. Some of them seem to have realized what exactly they want and are on the path to achieving it. Be it landing the right intern, maintaining the right CPI, completing those online courses, having that prestigious POR, or even a great sleep schedule. But for most of us, the story is different. It‚Äôs like a labyrinth (Bhul-Bhulaiya), i.e., an irregular network of endless passages, wherein we are not quite sure of what path we are on, where it will lead to, and whether we should have taken it.",
      "Andy: ‚ÄòThere are places in this world that aren‚Äôt made out of stone. That there‚Äôs something inside‚Ä¶that they can‚Äôt get to, that they can‚Äôt touch. That‚Äôs yours.‚Äô",
      "Red: ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôre you talking about?‚Äô",
      "Andy: ‚ÄòHope.‚Äô",
      "(The Shawshank Redemption)",
      "After all those insecurities, I realized that if there are endless passages, there are endless possibilities as well. And even on the worst of days, there‚Äôs a hope that we can still start over. We can begin the beginning that was long overdue. It‚Äôs hard for me to sum up my 4 years at IITK. However, if I had to, I would say it has been a recurring loop of sensing those insecurities and dealing with them with a lovely bunch of supportive people.",
      "Life (and the coronavirus) has taught me that only uncertainty is certain in this world. We must take out time to truly appreciate the small things we take for granted. These can be as small as going out with people or practicing whatever the opposite of social distancing is. I would say that I have been very fortunate to be a part of the Counselling Service, through which I met some really wholesome people. My friends from CSE dept., FMC clubs, and some caring seniors (graduated & graduating) and lovely juniors whom I met during this journey. And of course, Shivani and my wingmates, who turned out to be a family.",
      "",
      "When I look back at it, I feel that IITK ek vichitra jagah hai (IITK is a strange place!). The laws of conservation do not apply to this place, because a person who enters here leaves a part of them behind. And as I leave, a part of me stays. A part of me remains connected to this place, and this sense of belongingness is what I‚Äôm thankful for.",

      "Four years, four phases, four-twenties, a million memories, and a Fourier transformation. From a kid with a pipe dream to an adult with different pipe dreams.",
      "As I leave IITK, I am not sure if I am going soon. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not particularly in love with this place. What I am in love with, though, are the people I came across at IITK. I love the friends I made, the girlfriend I found, and the seniors who considered me worth their time when they ‚Äòinteracted‚Äô with me. It all started on the day I got Physics at IITK. As a teenager, I wanted to be a physicist, the good old aforementioned pipe dream. Slowly, this place got me to my senses, as I got high in the spirit of my friends‚Äô companionship and that of living while I‚Äôm young.",
      "IITK tried to teach me everything from Mathematics to Responsibility. What I learned here, however, was the one thing of utmost importance:Life. Spoiler Alert: The moral of my story is going to be,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to not be okay.‚ÄùI have walked out in the middle of more end-sems than I have sat through. With that fact in mind, let‚Äôs begin with the phases.",
      "PHASE 1 ‚Äì Interaction and Depression",
      "It came on the day I first set foot onto the grounds of this place, and would forever change my life and perspective of it. The simultaneous occurrence might suggest a cause-effect relationship. To that, I just want to say, No. Attempting to justify ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô has always proven rather futile in my experience. I have seen the campus transform in many ways, and I leave that to my peers‚Äô ‚ÄòAs We Leaves‚Äô. Little did I know what awaited me. If you‚Äôre a fresher, believe me, you probably don‚Äôt know what the hell you are doing here and what will eventually become of you. Have faith and plod on. If you are expecting me to elaborate on why I was depressed, I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you. I really don‚Äôt know. If you are struggling with depression today and fail to find a reason, don‚Äôt worry, there doesn‚Äôt always have to be one.",
      "My first happy day at IITK was Freshers‚Äô Night ‚Äô16. I was one of the six anchors chosen for the sole reason that I was an ‚Äòentertaining character,‚Äô as so casually stated by one of my favorite seniors, ‚ÄòPandu‚Äô [Shashank Bhandari (Y12)], a gem of a man. Back in the day, he was a fifth-year who unknowingly helped me cope with my depression throughout my first semester. While leaving, he said, ‚ÄúThakur, padh lena please.‚Äù I sure as hell didn‚Äôt take his parting advice. I just couldn‚Äôt. After he left, I found solace in poetry, thanks to ELS that gave me a platform for my first, a rather rudimentary attempt at it. I came in as an entertaining character and stayed on as an occasional poet. After scoring 0 in all my quizzes, my second semester‚Äôs end was marked by my sleeping through my PHY103 end-sem. How I passed will always stay a mystery. I want to reiterate that I was in the physics department and wanted to be a physicist. It‚Äôs funny how you spend all your life making plans, and then you hear god laughing.",
      "PHASE 2 ‚Äì Letting Go",
      "By the end of my first year, I had understood that staying in physics might as well be the end of me. One of the hardest things is to accept that one will have to give up on their childhood dream. Depression intensified as I sailed through my third semester, failing for the first time in the end. Once again, I had happily and ever so loudly snored through my PHY224 (Optics) end-sem in L2. The tutor woke me up, to whom I submitted a blank answer script and walked out of the exam. Another of my closest seniors suggested, ‚Äúyou should come to BSBE bro; you won‚Äôt survive in the physics department.‚Äù This time I decided to take my senior‚Äôs advice at the end of my 3rd semester, only to run away from my misery.",
      "‚ÄúOne of the hallmark moments in life is when you find the courage to let go of what you can‚Äôt change.‚ÄùI could see my 16-year-old self extremely disappointed in me. I wrote a poem about it as well, this time to no avail. Yet another one of my seniors in the physics department once said to me,‚Äúif dreams didn‚Äôt change, everyone would either be a pirate or a princess.‚Äù",
      "Now, as a BSBE Undergrad, my fourth semester began. In the same stride of giving up on my dream, I gave up on life. I was awake but not alive. I isolated myself, socially, emotionally, academically, and in every other way imaginable. With 56 credits registered, I didn‚Äôt appear for even a single lecture/quiz/midsem/presentation/assignment. The one or two I did appear for, I don‚Äôt recall. My entire fourth semester seems like a dark dream today. The only two reasons I appeared for the end-sems were my friends Shubham Gaur and Siddhant Raj, and the fear of getting terminated.PHASE 3 ‚Äì Rock Bottom",
      "The semester had ended, and with that, I had decided to end my social isolation. As expected, while I was out of campus partying with my friends, all our phones beeped. The fourth-semester results had arrived. After a few shots, and bracing myself for impact, I took my phone out and read my result aloud in a brief line: ‚ÄúF, F, F, F, F, F.‚Äù My whole world came crashing down. This was followed by a dramatic deafening silence. I didn‚Äôt have to calculate my SPI this time. It was a rather straightforward0.0.",
      "The night that followed was, of course, a blackout. The next afternoon when I woke up on the floor of my room on the ground floor of Hall 12, with my head heavy as a rock, I quite literally felt therock-bottomI had hit. Following that, I received two emails. One was jointly from the HOD and DUGC Convener of BSBE, asking me to meet them. The second from DoAA, stating I had been placed on Warning. The latter, honestly, was a relief. I had expected worse. With that, I had survived the first half of my Life at IITK.",
      "PHASE 4 ‚Äì Coming Back to Life [Pink Floyd]",
      "In the semester that followed, I found my true calling. In retrospect, all I went through was because I was not on the path I should have been on, and¬† I had been right in the middle of it to see the entire picture. I had been up all night before the first day of the fifth semester (like almost all other nights at IITK). I dragged myself to the first class of the semester,‚ÄúMolecular Cell Biology.‚ÄùThe course introduced me to the molecular basis of life. It immediately appealed to me like nothing else had in the past 2 years. I went to the following few classes and fell in love with it. Once I started studying Molecular Biology out of sheer interest, the other courses followed naturally. I was thoroughly enjoying myself.",
      "I stopped attending classes once again after the Mid-Sems, but I didn‚Äôt stop keeping up with my quizzes and assignments. After all, I realized attending classes took the discipline I simply didn‚Äôt have; and I still don‚Äôt. Molecular Biology went on to become my new dream. The end of the semester was marked by an SPI of8.0and me topping the end-sem of the course I had recently become so fond of. Since then, I have spent the following semesters exploring my love for biology, which has only grown with each passing day. In my experience, an 8.0 was relatively easy. All it took to do well in an exam was finishing the syllabus. All it took to complete the syllabus was one night of honest dedication before each quiz and assignment. The mid-sem and end-sem automatically followed. Give it a shot as a thumb rule. You will be pleasantly surprised by the results.",
      "My 0.0 taught me to keep my expectations in check. I learned that in my case, getting a B in a course is a realistic expectation, getting an A is a stroke of luck, and getting a C is good enough. As I learnt this, I saw my depression vaporize. Brandon Sanderson put it beautifully in his novel, The Way of Kings[*],‚ÄúExpectations were like fine pottery. The harder you held them, the more likely they were to crack‚Äù.",
      "I would like to premise this with, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. It‚Äôs not worth the opportunity cost of all the potential smiles you trade away in the process. It comes down to simple cost-benefit analysis in the end‚Äù. Take your time to celebrate the little achievements that come your way. Four out of the five HSS courses I did were in Psychology. It would be unfair not to mention the immense support I received from what I learnt in every one of these courses. The Psychology courses that our college has to offer can teach you a great deal about conflict resolution.",
      "",
      "SUMMARY",
      "As I look back at all the night-outs and trips to Kalyanpur, Ramaiya, Sagar Dhaba, Barasirohi, Nankari, OAT, CCD, and the various rooftops, despite all the depression, darkness, isolation, and failure, it‚Äôs been one hell of a ride, and a very fruitful one at that. All the mistakes I made, all the mental pain I endured, and all the ups and downs were absolutely worth it. I made two lifelong friends along the way, Anurag Kumar (Y15) and Shubham Gaur (Y16), found a compatible companion Shivangi Gupta, and learnt the most important lesson,‚Äúeverything that happens leads you to where you will be tomorrow; and it‚Äôs not going to be below rock bottom.‚Äù",
      "",
      "I also want to use this platform provided to me by Vox Populi to say, ‚ÄúIf you are struggling with your mental health, I am fairly easy to find. Come find me, let‚Äôs chat‚Äù. As is customary, I would like to end my story with a perfectly logical quote by Winston Churchill,‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going through hell, keep going.‚Äù",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "As We Leave is a perfect way to relish campus memories, and through this, Vox populi has given me the platform to share my 4-year experiences which will hopefully be both relatable and useful for the reader. I would like to take the readers for a campus tour, show them the places and tell my stories attached to them.",
      "Presenting to you these places in a way I will remember them forever.",
      "Let‚Äôs start with the Main Auditorium:",
      "This was the very place where my Mom and Dad left their pampered son to mature into a man. I remember myself standing upright, wearing a big logo t-shirt while carrying a spiky hairstyle, gazing at the grandeur of the institute. Right then, a senior asked me to get onto the stage and do ball-dance ‚Äòalone‚Äô. Listening to this, I was so scared of the embarrassment about to fall upon me. It took a lot more of such tasks for me to open up and quit worrying about people‚Äôs opinions. Those interactions with seniors taught me something no teacher could ever teach.",
      "Academic Area Road:",
      "Those outstretched roads bring back the memories of Treasure Hunt night out. Even today, I could still hear myself bragging about how I would be the Programming Club Coordinator and represent IITK in Inter IIT for Table Tennis. Spoiler Alert: None of this happened but what happened was better than all my plans.",
      "The Faculty Building:",
      "This walled building gathered most of the student crowd during the ADD-DROP period, with everyone requesting professors to accept their course. Other than such visits, I had one such incident here that shaped my approach towards academics. I was once collecting my exam copies from the Professor‚Äôs office. Utterly displeased with my marks, I exclaimed that I hate this course and just want to get done with it. To my surprise, the professor laughed and hence explained that no student can excel in a course without developing a genuine interest in it. For compulsory courses, the student must introspect to find what perspective of the course interests him and pursue the course along those lines. As for the choice of Electives, the highest priority must be given to one‚Äôs interest in the subject. His advice was opposite to the popular belief where we took courses for good grading policies and familiar classmates. I took his suggestion and not only did my grades improve further but so did the knowledge I got from every succeeding course.",
      "The Library, CC and CCD:",
      "My exam preparations used to be centred in these places for the first two years. Even after sipping two shots of coffee at CCD, I still remember dozing off with more than half the syllabus remaining! These places break your overconfidence and mould it into your intelligence. It is certainly assumed that with the right lecture notes and course book, one can somehow hack the course structure and get an A with bare minimum preparation. But in my perspective, this approach can only get someone an average grade. The differentiator for grades is always the learning one gets from being attentive in class. In my experience, there is no replacement for attending classes.",
      "",
      "Hall-5 : Parent Hall:",
      "This place has been my home for the first 3 years and it holds so many memories. It all started with my room- C101, my first ever accommodation at IITK and the wing‚Äôs C-bot where I met my new family, my wingmates. Every memory of it makes me nostalgic, from the beautiful peacocks that roamed everywhere around and even visited my room for sneaky snacking, the mess that took care of my nutrition, the canteen which provided a rescue from my midnight food cravings, to the quad where I was first introduced to the concept of ‚ÄòHall Feeling‚Äô. It is this ‚ÄòHall Feeling‚Äô that people within a hall uphold, irrespective of where they come from, their caste, their age or their academic year. It gives a sense of togetherness and unites people to pursue a common goal through Inter-Hall Competitions. The feeling of singing the ‚ÄòHall Anthem‚Äô in the quad would always give me goosebumps. I am sure wherever I go, this ‚ÄòHall Feeling‚Äô will stay with me and I will always be a ‚ÄòMughal‚Äô.",
      "Hall-9 : Final Hall:",
      "This place was witness to the most nervous phase of my IITK life a.k.a Placements. The tempest of those numerous tests, pre-placement talks, resume short listings, and interview cracking ‚Äògyaan‚Äô can overwhelm anyone and I was no exception. I remember crying myself to sleep when I couldn‚Äôt get the job offer I thought was ‚Äòjust perfect‚Äô for me. But as the interviews came closer, I was able to handle both rejections and shortlisting with a calm mind. Then came D-Day! I remember myself sitting there among many other deserving candidates. At that particular point, I could see people carrying everything, ironically, from handmade notes to even Hanuman Chalisa! But keeping all the nervousness at bay, I took a deep breath, grabbed my confidence and went in. I came out all ecstatic! I was selected for a great job.",
      "I have learnt one thing from all the interviews, ranging from internships to placement. The companies don‚Äôt need the most skilled person, because no matter how much you learn, your learning would be less than 10 percent of what you are going to do as an employee. Rather, they look for a person who will be the best fit for their organisation. The person who can handle pressure, communicate his thoughts and collaborate with people. And this can‚Äôt be learnt through any course but only from experiences. I learnt to handle pressure because of the fest‚Äôs Core Team interviews, to communicate my thoughts through course presentations and to collaborate with people during my involvement with fashion events. These things weren‚Äôt part of my resume but were part of me and that had made all the difference.",
      "",
      "Student Activity Centre and OAT :",
      "This was the place where I realised my inclination towards the field of Fashion. This henceforth turned out to be an unexpected passion I was devout to pursue! Back to square one, I remember waiting in the line for my audition walk for the Freshers Night: Fashion show, acclaimed to be the flagship event. For my turn, I did the best impression of a wannabe‚Äôs ramp walk and was rejected outrageously. This was my only chance to get onto the stage because I felt I wasn‚Äôt fit for other events. I asked the senior for a second chance and earned myself 24 hours to prepare. I needed to replace any of the shortlisted ones to acquire a spot. It took me an entire night to master my preparations. I even owed a treat to my wingies, who helped me and monitored my walk as I practised to get the gist of the task. Next day, I got the spot and later went on to being the showstopper! The moment I stepped into the limelight, there was no coming back for me. I wanted to feel what it is like to be on stage, to be the focus of everybody‚Äôs energy out there. In my next 4 years, I did professional and non-professional photoshoots, took part in fashion shows as a model, choreographed shows and represented IITK on the stages of Ritambhara, Impressionate and even Inter IIT. I will always be grateful for that second chance which evoked my journey into this world of fashion.",
      "",
      "Counselling Service Office:",
      "Everyone has their ups and downs and so did I. There was a time when I felt strangely alone on the entire campus. I stopped paying attention to my academics or the positions of responsibilities I held. The energy I had during my IIT JEE days till my 1styear was subsided and I was exhausted amidst the rush. Consecutive zeros in two of my quizzes made me reach out to Counselling Service for help. The sessions I attended there, not only consoled me but also introduced me to an unstated fact, that everyone is alone. This fact limits not only on the campus but in life as well. Each of us has different paths and destinations and while our paths may run parallel for some time but they have to diverge at one end. Such knowledgeable counselling sessions cleared my head, pushed me out of my sombre phase and helped me regain my lost energy.",
      "",
      "Visitor‚Äôs Hostel:",
      "This place will always remind me of my time as a member of the Public Relations team. This was the reason I could meet many amazing people from the field of sports, education, stand up comedy to singing. I remember spending an entire day with Olympic Gold Medalist Abhinav Bindra and having long engaging conversations with him about how he stays focused and aces each of his matches with such precision and ease. I thus learnt the art of staying calm in all situations from him, ‚Äòthe Arjun‚Äô of our era. Adding to this, ICC Umpire of the Year awardeeSimon Taufel mentored me during my 2nd year when I was confused about my career goals. He advised me to not be affected by people around and follow whatever my gut tells me. He illustrated it with times when he did not reconsider his decision based on the bowler, the batsman or even the importance of the match. I also remember interactions with Dr Meinolf Sellmann and being featured in a section of his presentation entitled ‚ÄòThe Campus Angels‚Äô. With candid pictures of me and my colleague, the section highlighted how we supported him throughout his campus stay. There are many more similar memories but I fall short of words to list them throughout! These people will continue to be my source of inspiration and motivation.",
      "Main Ground and Gym:",
      "Those compulsory P.E.s at this huge ground were really a pain to attend, but they actually started my fitness regime. Just around the corner stands the Old Sports Complex‚Äôs Gym that has witnessed my physique transformations throughout, from a protruding belly to well-built abs. This place helped me retrieve the fitness I lost during my JEE days!",
      "Main Auditorium Revisit:",
      "This is where my story will conclude. Besides my Orientation, Felicitations, Comedy Nights and even my Convocation(hopefully), I would love to remember this place as my Ritambhara stage! Standing on the 5 steps long ramp, in front of the judging panel and a massive audience, I could still hear myself saying ‚ÄòI stand here, as a proof that if an IITian wants to achieve something, he won‚Äôt stop until he gets it.‚Äô This will always remain the day I proved all the naySayers wrong.",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. After all the analysis and discussions, my JEE rank was such that I had to finalize between IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras. My parents insisted on IITM because it is closer to my hometown. But I wanted to come north, and hence chose IITK. I came to Kanpur from Agra via road and on reaching the periphery of the campus, I was shocked to see the surroundings and wished for an error with Google maps. This cannot be an IIT! A railway crossing at the entrance of the campus, and that too it was closed then, was a further shock. Sitting inside the car, gazing at the passing train, I started to doubt my decision. But once I passed the main gate, I saw two distinct worlds separated by that crossing. Excitement subdued that feeling of shock. Orientation started with a great first day, but the very next day I had 104‚ÑÉ fever and was admitted to the HC for the next 4 days, missing the rest of the orientation and the very first interactions with my wingies, Bapu and Chachas. It led to me finding solace in an old friendship with Akhil and drifting me apart from my wingmates. It took me a little time to finally be a part of my wing. But who knew over these years, I would be so much in love with this place and people here, that I can blindly say that these four years of my life were the best of times I have lived.",
      "After completing a month and scrutinizing my quiz 1 performance, a very foolish thought got stuck in my head ‚ÄúDassa aane se toh raha nahi, ab kuch bhi CPI aa jaye, koi fark nahi padega.‚Äù Consequently, I started skipping lectures and got busy spending merry time with friends, exploring campus, and doing whatnot with full enthu. Almost every other night, we used to explore the campus on foot. One of my best first-year memories includes all of us gathering in a room, with lights off, and talking about paranormal stories which once led me to run out of the room reciting the Hanuman Chalisa.",
      "One thing which has been and will always be very close to my heart is Antaragni. In my first year itself, when the nominations for Antaragni were out, I was very keen on becoming a Ritambhara volunteer, obviously because of the hype and ‚Äòperks‚Äô told by the seniors (most of you must be aware of it!). I prepared for my interview for a couple of hours! During the festival when I saw the core team with walkies and Metal ID, I thought, ‚ÄúYaar, yeh toh pehenna hai ek din‚Äù. No wonder, I have been part of the Antaragni team for 4 years, and have truly enjoyed it.",
      "Because of how frivolous I‚Äôd become, My grades suffered and I ended with a CPI of 7.6 in the first semester. Next sem, I started off with the ‚Äòcliched next sem fod dunga wala attitude‚Äô,¬† but again things were as usual after a couple of weeks, and my SPI further tanked to 7.1 bringing my first year CPI to 7.4.",
      "",
      "Like a lot of enthu filled first yearites, I explored many clubs and fests. Being a part of one of these organizations, paving the way for my career. I was a Company Coordinator in SPO in my 2nd year which made me realize 2 important things. Firstly, I was now aware of the importance of CPI in the future, and wanted the seemingly safe CPI of 8 for myself. Secondly, I came to know about the frenzy on campus for Day 1 internships and that there are 2 such core companies, HUL and ITC for Chemical engineering that is sought after. This lured and motivated me, and I started to concentrate on my academics and managed to bring my CPI to 8.1 after the fourth semester. The SIP internship drive familiarised me with the types of profile choices. I realized most of the roles offered were of coding profiles, and I neither liked coding nor was good at it. I was still unclear about how to spend my next summer. Meanwhile, to explore core chemical engineering, I took a UGP under one of the professors in my department in my fourth sem who offered me an intern for a couple of months at TATA Steel, Jamshedpur. This intern experience gave me a fair idea about my core work culture and now I was ready to sit for the campus internship season with a fair resume in hand.",
      "",
      "Second-year was special to me for a lot of reasons. I was a student guide and the pure and innocent bond that I shared with my bacchas is something that I‚Äôll cherish forever. I thoroughly enjoyed my leisurely hours then, by playing a lot of volleyball and cricket in our hall. Also, my second-year room was the best I have lived in IITK. Room No. 262, 6mid, Hall 3, exactly at the center of the wing, on the 1st floor with a view of basketball ground in front. Fresh air and sunlight flocked in as soon as you opened the door; peacocks roaming on the ground graced the view by their presence from the balcony too. And Dipankar made a perfect roommate, with whom I share a very special bond.",
      "",
      "My next semester had a very good start. I was well prepared for the internship season having a very strong desire either to get into ITC or HUL. Things went my way, and I secured an internship at HUL. And the icing on the cake, I was later informed that my internship location was Indonesia. And I could not have asked for a better 2 months than those I had spent in Indonesia. From an academic point of view, the next two semesters were pretty good. Being free from the internship burden, I tried to explore coding by taking up DS and by the time it ended, I was sure that I didn‚Äôt want to land a coding profile job. Apart from the general stuff, I had a lot of reckless experiences with proxy attendance. I was caught in 5 courses keeping a proxy and was on the verge of getting deregistered in 2 of the courses, but lucky enough not to have any severe consequences of it. Though I would sincerely advise everyone not to indulge in all these malpractices üòõ .",
      "Before the 7th semester, I was clear in my head that either I wanted to get into management consulting or into HUL through a PPO. I was also the Head of Media and Publicity for Antaragni‚Äô19. I knew it was going to be a very hectic semester. The semester started with bad news. I didn‚Äôt get a PPO from HUL against my strong expectations. It took me 3 to 4 days to come out of this shock. But then, I was determined to make things work for me now on.",
      "Antaragni was in October, and my target companies (Mckinsey, BCG, Bain) had their interviews in September-October. The initial three months of my semester were really nerve-wracking. I knew the real challenge was to manage all the three things i.e. acads, placement and antaragni and excel in each rather than ruining even one of these. It all started with my Mckinsey interview. I was rejected in the second round though I felt I had performed decently enough. It was the first time when I started to doubt my capabilities. I used to sit in the PE ground for hours just overthinking about what was going on in my life. Then came my BCG interview where I was rejected again, though this time I knew my interview didn‚Äôt go well. Now with Antaragni approaching, the workload was immense, and Bain was my final shot before the placement season. I was pretty confident about my cases, so I calmed myself down. And finally, I got an offer from Bain and Company and I was relieved from the placement stress. Now I just had to look forward to those 4 days of Antaragni, which were truly the best 4 days of my campus life. Tears trickled down my eyes out of joy when I was on the stage with the entire team after the final night of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy.",
      "",
      "7th semester was the most happening and probably the best semester I had. After all these experiences, I feel one should never lose hope and continue believing in himself/herself however adverse the situation becomes because one day surely the hard work pays off and things turn out your way. Being a part of the core team gave me the best of my times, be it the experiences of the learning opportunities through the work or the bond which I have with some of my friends. During these tough times, I had the constant support and motivation of my Co Head, Shreya. From practicing cases at the BSBE building at night after a long busy day of work to going out for sudden dinner plans with some of our lovely juniors, I have spent some of my toughest and best moments with her.",
      "",
      "The best part about my campus life will surely be the friends I have made throughout my journey. I believe the place becomes more beautiful if you have good people around you. From making family-like friends in my wing (Dipankar, Sahil, Mahesh, Laksh), to learning my courses a day before the exams from my friends, Amit, Vishnu, Yash and Vikram, I have truly enjoyed every moment of the process. To add to the ‚Äòlearning‚Äô that I did with them, I must say I am lucky to have a friend like Amit who not only got me through those last night mug ups but also made more assignment submissions for me than I personally did. Thank You PRANK (Parth, Rahul, Abhishek and Navneet) for making my last semester such a memorable one. I hardly remember having dinner in my mess in the 4th year because almost every other day I used to go out with my friends, and I can bet very few people on campus would have gone out for dinner as much as I did.",
      "",
      "Finally, I would like to thank IIT Kanpur for being such a great host. This place has given me almost everything, from such a beautiful campus to my dream internship, my dream job, my Antaragni moments, and such beautiful friends. Those late-night campus tours, those impromptu dinner plans, Mama Mio drinks in all seasons, hanging out with friends for the 3 AM chats in all corners of campus, and even the SSACs, my experience here has been truly versatile, be it good or bad. I don‚Äôt wish to change even a single incident. Lastly, I can blindly say that I am ready to relive these 4 years of my campus life on a loop without giving a second thought. But yeah, I wish that was possible!!",

      "-Naina Talwar (Get ready for more quotes from my favorite Bollywood film: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani)",
      "Where do I even begin telling this story? It was a long journey that we traveled, and looking back at it now, I am gripped with nostalgia. Let‚Äôs start at the very beginning. Although my first year at IITK has given me some terrific memories, it was not a great start. I wanted to use my time here to try out everything that I had wanted to do after finally getting the freedom after JEE. I attended way too many workshops, responded to almost every email we received, and tried to get involved in many clubs and fests. I found it challenging to cope academically because of that, and an insincere effort to keep up with the classes and tutorials. Apart from this, in the first sem, I was too moody, disgruntled most of the time because of not being able to balance things. It was only after I met some of the most amiable people in my second sem (with whom I would stay till the end of my journey at IITK), did I start to enjoy my stay here.",
      "",
      "In my second year, because literally ALL of my friends/wingies were doing it, I too applied for the post of HEC and became the Science and Technology Secy. I took up a lot of things simultaneously in this semester: Takneek, antaragni dance practices, FLP german course, techkriti, Ritambhara secy, SPO secy, aero club ‚Äì all of this in one sem (and I bet there were some other things too which I cannot recall right now)! I wanted to take up everything at once and prove myself at multitasking. I felt I had matured after the first year, and this time I would be successful in balancing things. I kept oscillating from one club to another the entire day, leaving myself no time to study which resulted in single-digit marks in tests. After Takneek ended, I had just one week left to prepare for my midsem. This caused me a nervous breakdown. I sat down on Monday, trying to begin studying subjects from scratch, and I just couldn‚Äôt. I was crying and cursing myself for neglecting studies to such an extent. Monday went by, and I couldn‚Äôt open my textbooks. Since I didn‚Äôt want to disturb my friends because exams were near, I went to a solitary place in the academic area at night and called my dad and cried my heart out on the phone. In an effort to calm me down, he joked about not failing any course and told me he doesn‚Äôt care even if I get D in all my courses.",
      "I started studying from the very next day and talked to dad almost 3-4 times daily. I gathered strength by consoling myself that this sem doesn‚Äôt count, and I will perform better the next time (Next sem phod denge :P). In the midsems, I performed really badly in some courses and really good in others. Finally, when the much-awaited mid-semester recess arrived, I spent time at home and introspected a lot. And when I came back to the campus, I gave up everything, literally everything: every club or anything I was part of, to study. (This made facing some people on the campus really difficult over the next few years :P). I don‚Äôt know how I managed an SPI of 9.6 and an A in a course in which I had much below-average marks in the midsem. The success of this sem made me realize what actually made me happy. I understood that it is impossible to have everything in life at once- ‚ÄúKitna bhi try karlo Bunny, life me kuch na kuch to chootega hi.‚Äù¬† But I am glad, I at least tried!",
      "",
      "I don‚Äôt despise my third semester or wish that the first half of it had never happened. There is nothing I would go back and change. Because, in the words of Ted Mosby, ‚Äúif I hadn‚Äôt gone through hell to get there, the lesson might not have been as clear‚Äù (though used in an entirely different context :P). The next four semesters were great- only academic and career pressure (XD). I studied a lot and became very competitive for my grades. I did not take up any POR since then because I felt I didn‚Äôt need anything apart from my studies to engage myself. Yes, I became that maggu who started doing ‚Äúrevision‚Äù (sometimes even multiple) before an exam! After my SURGE project in the second year summer, I felt strongly about pursuing a career in research and wanted to go for a research internship in the third year. So I didn‚Äôt sit for company internships and worked hard to grab a research intern abroad. And after coming from the internship, I applied for higher studies in the 7th sem. Although I summed up the other one and a half years of college in a very few sentences here, which might give one the impression that everything went smoothly. It was actually a combination of many ups and downs, tough decision making, and taking risks. It wasn‚Äôt easy to see everyone around me get good internships in the 5th sem, while I didn‚Äôt even seem close to getting one till the middle of the 6th sem. It wasn‚Äôt easy to give up on the placement drive without telling my parents about my decision to apply for a Ph.D. It wasn‚Äôt easy to see people get their dream jobs, while I was still applying to colleges and wasn‚Äôt even sure if I would hear back from them anytime soon. I didn‚Äôt know what the future held in store for me, while it seemed (at least on the outside) that everyone had their life settled.",
      "Problems went by, but there were a few constants in the variables of my life here- my friends, who were there with me throughout these four years. Astha, Pragya, Bhumika, Smriti, Shreya, Navanya, Shivani, and Ishika- I can‚Äôt even tell you what your friendship means. No achievement seemed an achievement unless you appreciated me. No failure seemed to hurt that much when I had your shoulder to cry on. I made big decisions in my life telling you folks first,before telling anybody. You helped me become the person I am today. In these 4 years, I have grown so used to living with you, that it‚Äôs difficult to accept that our time together has ended and we have to part ways. Seriously, life in college is unimaginable without our squad! It was so fascinating to see us all grow together and mature. I still remember the words our director said to us during one of the auditorium orientation sessions: ‚ÄúPeople come here as boys and girls, but leave this place as men and women.‚Äù So true!",
      "",
      "I want to devote one paragraph to the lessons I learned in IITK based on my personal experience. So that, when I face a similar crisis in my life later, I can look back to this post and relive those lessons. Or anybody, who reads this post, can take something meaningful from it. Firstly, do not let anyone think you cannot achieve something. I had people telling me that I was not good enough and would not get into some colleges, only to crush my spirits. I wish I could tell this to my 7th sem self: Do not let people dictate your thoughts and tell you what you can and cannot do; you‚Äôll get through it, and do great. Secondly, never think that your experiences will remain constant- no failure or success is permanent. That is something I believe IITK teaches you fast, it gives you plenty of room for correction and I learned it in my third semester. And lastly, do not be afraid to take risks for following your heart and passion. This is the place and time to do it. I was terrified about some of the decisions I made, like not sitting for internships and placements and going for higher studies. But all‚Äôs well that ends well. Do not overthink because no decision is absolutely good or bad, but once you have made a decision, just stick to it no matter what.",
      "For a long time, I postponed writing this because I thought my journey was pretty ordinary, and my experiences were pretty much the same as everyone who comes here. But then someone made me realize, there will never be an idiot named Shivali Agrawal again, who lived in C-609, loved to dance, and celebrated every occasion with a pizza. This made me realize, you don‚Äôt have to put effort to make your journey unique, because it already is.",
      "This place gave me memories and friends to cherish for a lifetime. ‚ÄúYaadein mithai ke dabbe ki tarah hoti hai, ek baar khula to sirf ek tukda nahi khaa paoge.‚Äù I miss going to the canteen together and singing along to Nora Fatehi songs (there would always be one playing on the TV whenever we went!). I miss pulling pranks and teasing that one member of the group. I miss shouting ‚ÄúVeeras ka tempo high hai‚Äù at the top of my lungs, after coming second in group dance in the first year galaxy. I miss getting dressed up and roaming around the campus at 2 am for absolutely no reason, singing friendship songs with my gang. And I‚Äôll always remember how, when we thought we would have ‚Äúthe time of our lives‚Äù in the last sem, we had to leave midway. Deep down, we all knew that saying goodbye to this place and the people would be the hardest thing we have had to do. And so, When our ‚Äúsee you soon‚Äù turned unexpectedly to ‚Äúgoodbye forever,‚Äù it was so bittersweet.",

      "To Y16: We had to end this journey sooner than we thought we would. We‚Äôre not sure if we‚Äôll get to meet each other anytime soon. They say time is the most mighty warrior. It destroys everything we do or make, even the most beautiful things in the world. But time cannot fade the strength of our memories. Nothing is ever lost as long as we remember it. A part of us will always be there at IITK, with each other. A few years down the line, we might lose touch, we‚Äôll be in entirely different places, having our jobs and families. But our minds will keep going back to the timeless moments that we spent at IITK. And in that way, we will be there forever!",

This edition brings you the story of Prem Das Rai,¬†a distinguished alumnus of IITK from the batch of 1976. He is a former member of Parliament who represented the people of Sikkim for 10 years in the parliament. He is the first and the only member of Parliament with degrees from both an IIT as well as an IIM.Do give it a read to know more about his journey and how IITK affected his career choice.",
      "‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-",
      "How did you get motivated to join politics? How did you start off? Tell us the story.",
      "To understand my journey, I need to tell you about my father. Around 1935, he got interested in the independence movement of India and was influenced by socialists like JP Narayan, Madhu Limaye and others. Concurrently, there was an ambiguity if Sikkim was going to join the Indian Union or be a separate country. And in this connection, he came back to Sikkim, joined forces with people supporting democracy to form the Sikkim National Congress. To cut a long story short, I would say that it was my father who ideated and embedded the spirit of democracy in Sikkim. Hence, this was table talk in our home and it influenced me deeply.",
      "Meanwhile, in 1960, I went to Mussoorie for my schooling. After that, in 1971, I joined IITK. In 1975, Sikkim finally merged with India as the 22nd state of India. So, I often tell people thatI entered IITK as a foreigner and left IITK as an Indian, unique!After IITK, I joined IIM Ahmedabad, which brought me to a well-paying and comfortable job with the Bank of America (BoA) in Calcutta(now Kolkata) in 1978.",
      "1979 was the turning point in my life when I visited Gangtok. My father, who was then in the government, asked me to call on the first Governor of Sikkim, Shri BB Lall, an ICS officer. I went to meet him, and his first question was after I told him proudly that I was at BoA,¬† ‚ÄúWhat! You‚Äôre serving the Bank of America and not your own country! You‚Äôre wasting all your time and effort. We need you back in Sikkim.‚Äù So you can imagine that with a father who has ideated the concept of democracy in Sikkim, it wasn‚Äôt difficult for me to leave my well-paying job and come back to Sikkim. At that time, Bank of America offered me a princely salary of 5000 rupees a month. And the salary when I started off in Sikkim was just 790 rupees per month (laughs)! Nevertheless, my mother was most delighted to find out that I‚Äôd be coming back home.",
      "Returning to Sikkim, I involved myself in some interesting projects but the most special one I led was setting up an Amul-like cooperative dairy facility. That project gave me a lot of insight into how public policy works. It was finally in 1993 I started working in the newly formed opposition, the SDF Party. Now, over 25 years in politics! In 2009, I was given a ticket from the Sikkim Democratic Party (SDF) and I served the people of Sikkim for two terms in the Parliament!",
      "Before joining politics, you were a prolific entrepreneur and also the editor of ‚ÄúThe Gangtok Times‚Äù, can you tell us more about those days?",
      "When I left the government, I needed to do some economic activity to financially support my family. So, I became an entrepreneur and started a small computer company. Then I launched a newspaper. Today you can simply set up a portal, shift to social media and run a media company. It was difficult to run a newspaper back then. It was difficult to get people to edit papers.",
      "From all the work that I immersed myself in, I learned some important skills such as managing people, communicating effectively, judging when to move forward and when to move back. These skills are very important for politicians to have. I think that ultimately, everything is about entrepreneurship; be it opening a business, working with communities or politics!",
      "Tell us about a regular day in your life these days.",
      "A day in my life would almost entirely involve meeting people, my seniors, party leaders and the chief minister. Apart from that, it would involve attending functions, especially with the panchayats, interest groups and civil society. So almost throughout the day, I would be meeting people, trying to understand their concerns, looking at why a particular problem is emerging and what can be done about it.",
      "I get up very early in the morning. It is when I spend time with my family and do my yoga, reading and reflecting.",
      "Do you think that acquiring a public office takes away your privacy, personal and family life? If so, how do you deal with the constant media attention and social media trolling that most popular politicians face today?",
      "Constant media attention is inevitable once you are in the public eye. Everything becomes transparent and you cannot keep a secret. So accordingly, my work needs to be very principle centric.",
      "Coming to social media trolling and memes, they might be offensive but must be taken in the right spirit. They often give you feedback which is honest and couldn‚Äôt have been told otherwise. Hence, I try to take feedback from trolls and memes rather than viewing them negatively.",
      "The perception of politics among common people is very negative and characterized by a lot of corruption, dirty tactics and lack of ethics. Did your perception of Indian Politics change after becoming a part of it?",
      "The fundamental issue with politics is that politics is about volunteerism. You are expected to want very little for yourself but give away most of what you have, in terms of energy, time or whatever else that matters. During the freedom struggle, politics was almost entirely structured on selfless volunteerism. But now in the 21st Century, we have lost most of that commitment.",
      "Politics has become hugely problematic by way of money being poured in. You need to spend huge sums of money to win elections and this money doesn‚Äôt come from anywhere else but through a very negative process. Hence, the system is undoubtedly corrupt.",
      "However, I would argue that there are enough ‚Äòclean people‚Äô within that system. That is why we have a polity which may seem to be working. So I would say that we are at the crossroads at this point and it is arguably very difficult to change but nonetheless, we must.",
      "What we generally see in today‚Äôs politics is the lack of education among politicians. So, you being one of the most educated politicians out there, why do you think educated people do not enter politics and how can we change that?",
      "There is a perception issue about what education is! Many of my colleagues, who don‚Äôt have a degree, are very welleducatedon the skills that a politician requires.",
      "Hence, there is a misbelief that only the IITs and IIMs produce the best. A politician needs many more skills and abilities, such as a sense of history, a sense of social science and most importantly, empathy. So, I would argue the reverse. That there are enough educated people in politics ensuring diversity of views and perceptions. We need to correct the stereotypical perception of what qualifications are required for politics.",
      "Did coming from a political background help you attaining a seat? If yes, then for young people interested in joining politics who do not have a family background in politics, where do you think they should start?",
      "Definitely, it helped. I picked up some skillsets because of my father‚Äôs mentorship.Politics is a game of real understanding of the human spirit and about humanity.If there are young political enthusiasts in IITs, they should devote their time to wonderful books of history of our democracy, social sciences, the ideology of Karl Marx, modern neoliberalism thought and the like. Look at those books from the perspective of the Constitution of India. Only then you‚Äôll understand the ideology driving a political party.¬† Also, you‚Äôll have to work in a social venture, in which you‚Äôll work with farmers, grassroots operators, activists just to understand the dynamics of politics. There is no explicit pathway that I can prescribe. It is a journey of learning. After getting a quality education from the Indian institutes, don‚Äôt rush to foreign countries for white-collar jobs. Try to stay back here. I would love to mentor any student from IITK who is passionate about politics and wants to pursue it as a career. It‚Äôs an open invitation.",
      "How was your experience of representing the people of Sikkim at the parliament for 10 years? What were the major decisions you took that created a social impact?",
      "Not everyone gets this opportunity, and I feel privileged to serve my people and the nation. When you enter the Parliament, you need to be quick-witted to come up with optimal solutions. It took me a couple of years to efficiently use the tools Parliament provides to be heard and express your electorate‚Äôs voice. I participated in many debates wherein you can formulate the questions and views, especially those affecting your state and region.",
      "During my tenure, I was a part of many Parliamentary Standing Committees such as the Finance Committee, the Subordinate Legislation Committee, the Ethics Committee, the IT Committee. I also made a Private Member‚Äôs Bill related to bamboo production in India. In 2015, my idea was picked up and legislated by Parliament. Bamboo is now defined as a grass and not a tree and made independent of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) oversight. China was able to amass billions of dollars through Bamboo production and exports, while we haven‚Äôt made even a billion or so. This disparity can now be overcome due to this amendment.",
      "I also represented India along with 59 other MPs in the United Nations in 2018, where we looked at multilateralism. I was seconded by the Parliament to become a member of the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I was also the Chairperson of the Library Committee and the Fellowship Committee in Parliament. Apart from this I also served as the Secretary-General of the North East MPs Forum.",
      "Coming to Sikkim, I helped in creating a Bill for the Sikkim State Assembly which was related to sustainable development goals. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt become an act. We also founded an organization called, ‚ÄòThe Integrated Mountain Initiative‚Äô. It focuses on empowerment, ecology and the well-being of the mountain communities. I was also a part of the program SAATHI. It aims to counteract the menace of drugs in the school system. We also ran a program called EQUIP (Education Quality Improvement). GoI recognized the program and has adopted it. It aims for improving the existing capacities of educational institutes.I‚Äôm a part of the Universal Basic Income Program running in the country, and I‚Äôve written extensively about it.",
      "What kind of problems do you face when you want to take an initiative or implement it? How do you tackle them?",
      "In any program that you want to implement, you‚Äôll face a multitude of problems. It‚Äôs because of the difference in perspectives amongst the concerned individuals and stakeholders. The questions you need to answer for any kind of project you work on are: How do you seek cooperation and how do you collaborate? One of the challenges was to get funds from the Parliament for local area development. If you‚Äôre in charge of the fund then you can make the most of it. Rainfall and landslides can also cause a lot of obstacles in local projects. Even as we speak today, it has been pouring since last night. To handle these kinds of things one must be efficient in project management. It‚Äôs tough and these challenges will always remain.",
      "Tell us about your experience at IITK. Are there any memories that you would like to share?",
      "I was in hall 3. I had many friends in the senior batches. In fact, Rakesh Gangwal (co-founder of Indigo) is one of my senior batchmates and a close friend amongst the many. I used to play a lot of sports on campus. I was the captain of the IITK football team. I got some flavor of politics on the campus itself. I ran for the general secretary of sports in the 4thyear. I lost very narrowly to my friend, Arun Shukla. Later on, I understood that this fight was between ideologies. I was backed by the ideology of the communists and he was backed by the ideology of the RSS(laughs)!IIT was a lot of fun, a lot of bull sessions. We used to regularly go to hall canteens for chai, fried rice, chow mien. We also had thatthickaloo parathafor breakfast on Sundays. We had a magazine calledSparkand there used to be a competition organized by them called theSpark Cycling Race. I got 25 rupees for winning that and I spent all of that plus much more for giving a treat to my friends at the canteen!",
      "The entire Computer Centre had only one huge computer, the IBM 370 and it used to be very cold in there due to the air conditioning. So summers would be made palatable by doing some computing work. I also remember spending some valuable time at the library, which I must say was one of the best places on campus. Next year my spouse and I will be coming to campus for the 45threunion with the batch of ‚Äò76! I doubt if COVID will allow us (laughs)!",
      "How do you compare other ways of making a social impact like working with an NGO or joining civil services vis-√†-vis politics?",
      "Politics is the ultimate way to bring about any lasting societal change. The power of the legislation is the final form of public policy. But to start with politics, first, you‚Äôll have to work for smaller organizations like NGOs. Learning the dynamics of how to deal with people, building empathy, understanding nuances of solving a societal issue, etc are very well understood by working in an NGO.¬† In India, civil society organizations are small in size and usually driven by one person which becomes a limiting factor. But I think these are also needed especially during this pandemic. The NGOs have done a marvelous job in feeding millions of daily wage laborers and helping them get to their homes. Every effort in solving our nation‚Äôs challenges is always welcome, especially if they are from citizen initiatives.",
      "Lastly, what is the message you would like to give to the current student community at IITK?",
      "You are very privileged to be educated in IITK and you should value this because one, it is very difficult to get into an IIT and two, you have the responsibility of keeping the legacy and brand of IITK alive which the alumni have built over the years. You must have a sense of building the nation. If you are getting the country‚Äôs top educational resources then you should give it back to the country, give it back to your community, give it back to society.",
      "Whatever you do, think of India and solve the challenges we have as a nation and there are plenty. If you want to enter politics, come talk to me, I would be very happy to mentor.",

      "Harsh Gupta is a final year undergraduate in the Mechanical Engineering department. Let‚Äôs have a look at his journey at IIT Kanpur and live the nostalgia and reminiscence with him.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Hey everybody! Hope you are all doing fine and staying healthy! Welcome to my side of the story. Up until now, most of you have known me to be a fun-loving, carefree, cheery guy with a broad smile always on his face. All of this is true definitely, but there‚Äôs a lot more to what goes on inside. In this article, I aim to bring upon the untold and unheard side of the story, one which most-often fails to make the headlines. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs dive right in!",
      "If it is about telling a journey, it would obviously start with the dream. Yes, I had made it to IIT Kanpur, one of the best in the country! The first semester was pure bliss. Getting to experience the magnificence of IITK, learning about its rich, diverse culture, it was all an overwhelming & mesmerizing experience. The second semester started with ‚ÄòGalaxy‚Äô being the talk of the town! There was a wind of excitement & enthusiasm sweeping through us all as the practices for this cultural extravaganza began! I had participated in Dance events and boy it was so fantastic! Memories of intense practice sessions, all those night outs, skipping lectures, and ultimately winning the prestigious Galaxy & Dance trophy flash through my mind as I recall those beautiful times.",
      "But inside of my mind, there was a different problem finding its root and growing. I remember some of my dance practice sessions when I would feel an enormous amount of anxiety resulting from the fear of certain thoughts becoming true. It would make me uncomfortable in my own skin. Not that it used to happen all the time, but yes, often enough to affect me in a bad, bad way. It was like a tendency. A vicious loop of overthinking. My mind used to be preoccupied with recurring compulsive thoughts, some of which leaving me anxious & sweating. I used to try my best to keep myself distracted from these thoughts so that they could stop affecting me, but with little success. On occasions, my mind wouldn‚Äôt stop overthinking, imagining the rarest of scenarios and most uncommon of things, leaving me completely gripped in anxiety. These feelings were further amplified as I did not share them with anyone and kept them to myself. I feared being judged and mocked.",
      "This pattern continued on and off, throughout the second sem, until I realized I can‚Äôt deal with all of this alone. I knew I needed to seek professional help and go see a psychiatrist. So, I mustered all my courage and finally decided to open up to my parents about what all I had been going through, asking them to let me visit a psychiatrist. My parents were extremely supportive. So, summer‚Äô17 was the 1st time I visited a psychiatrist and above all, it was relieving! He diagnosed me with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Anxiety issues and suggested I undertake medication. So, without any further delay, I undertook medication and thankfully, could see the positive results straight away. I was in a much better state of mind now. Feeling at peace with myself. However, I still did not share this with any of my friends. I used to secretly take my meds, hiding it from my roomie as if feeling guilty and ashamed about taking them. You see that‚Äôs the kind of stigma mental health holds in our society.",
      "I continued my meds for about a month and a half and then stopped, thinking that I‚Äôm now absolutely all right. The issues I had been facing did subside to a significant extent, but some of them were still there, on and off. For the next two years, I dealt with all sorts of uneasiness and anxiety myself, that used to hit me time and again, thinking that it is something I need to learn to cope up with. And I did learn to tackle my problems by naturally developing some sorts of defense mechanisms. The first of them obviously was to pretend in society as if nothing is wrong. To always keep a smile no matter how troubled you might feel internally. Because it‚Äôs not easy to explain your problem to anyone and hope that they will understand it.",
      "So, by the time my 7th semester started, I was pretty much used to dealing with my OCD and anxiety, and the uneasiness it caused sporadically. It did hinder my working efficiency to a significant extent and occupied a big chunk of my mental prowess in dealing with it, and consequently, I was left with less mental energy to focus on my academics and other constructive things. But, as I said, I had grown used to them.",
      "7th semester was the Placement sem when the recruitment process of the companies would start, with their tests and PPTs happening. I was targeting coding profiles and had the confidence that I would crack the placements if I diligently continue with my preparations. I knew I hadn‚Äôt been able to devote enough time to my preparations during the summer‚Äô19 owing to my internship and therefore, 7th sem for me was key! I had been doing just fine up until late September, after which something changed. It was around the Dussehra break in early Oct, that I realized that I had started feeling very dull & pessimistic as if lacking motivation & purpose. It was a very strange & complex feeling, difficult to put into words. I didn‚Äôt feel like getting off my bed those days and getting any work done. For about 2 weeks then, my preparations had taken a serious hit. I was all over the place. But this time I was extremely determined. I had decided that no matter what, I will NOT allow anything to get in my way and affect my placements. I wanted to get rid of my mental troubles once and for all! So, October 24th was the 2nd time I visited the psychiatrist. This time determined to carry on with my meds and be in constant touch with my doctor until the time I‚Äôm completely cured!",
      "I knew of my OCD & anxiety troubles now, but, to my surprise, this time I was also diagnosed with Depression, alongside these! It came as a shocker for me! I remember feeling numb for a moment in front of my doc because not even in the worst of my nightmares had I ever imagined myself to be in depression! But this time my attitude was different. I wanted to get rid of my mental illness once and for all! And wanted to be at my absolute best by the time placements began! By god‚Äôs grace, there was no turning back ever since. Soon after my session with the doc, I could feel the positive changes in my mood, mindset, and behavior and I was able to get back to working properly in no time, with my efficiency increasing and anxiety alleviating! Finally, all the efforts and hard work paid off as I landed a job offer in NoBroker in the Software Developer role on December 2nd. Undoubtedly, it was one of the happiest days of my life.",
      "",
      "In hindsight, I realize that it wasn‚Äôt so difficult to deal with my mental illness had I continued with my medication and remained in touch with my doctor the very first time itself! Rather, it was made difficult because of the STIGMA that surrounds it! The TABOO it has become, courtesy of our society! Which makes the process of reaching out & seeking help extremely difficult! Because of which people suffer. If only we treat mental health the same way we treated our physical health-related problems, the world would become so much easier & better for so many of the people facing any such problems. This was precisely the reason why I chose to share my side of the story related to mental health through this article. It is an attempt to normalize such issues, to advocate that it is OKAY if any of you is facing any such problem & to convey that it‚Äôs absolutely alright to go see a counsellor, therapist or a psychiatrist, whenever need be!",
      "",
      "My journey would be incomplete without the mention of Photography Club, IITK in it. Some of my most endearing memories of college life come from the Photography Club itself. From conducting workshops, organizing photo-walks, setting up exhibitions to leading the team in the Inter IIT Cult Meet‚Äô18, I had seen it all. It was a wholesome and enriching experience. FMC room was one place where I would find solace and happiness from my otherwise monotonous schedule. It used to switch me into a different zone altogether. Obviously the soul of the club lies in its members! And we were fortunate to have a great bunch of people as part of the club. In hindsight, I feel glad and proud to have been a part of the legacy of the club. It catered to my leadership and creative side and became the reason for some of my happiest memories in IIT Kanpur!",
      "",
      "Life can be really difficult if you don‚Äôt have supportive friends around you! I realized this from 5th semester onwards when I had slowly and steadily started opening up about my mental health issues with my friends. It used to be a big relief. Although it took me A LOT of time (until mid 7th semester) to properly open up to my friends and talk about exactly how I feel, I‚Äôm glad this happened! It helped me come out of my shell and break the mental barrier that exists towards seeking help in case of mental health problems. No wonder they say, TALKING HELPS! My two pillars of strength in my college life were Prateek Gupta & Ritik Rohit! They were like my go-to peeps in any time of crisis. It would be unfair if I miss out on some of the other names who‚Äôve been supportive of me, acknowledged me, and made me realize I‚Äôm worth something! Vinayak S Kamath, Arnav Garg, Simran Sundrani, Shikhar Dayal, Ayush Garg & Priyal Sachan! Thank You! College life wouldn‚Äôt have been as memorable if it weren‚Äôt for you!",
      "Before I wrap things up, let me advocate some ‚Äògyaan‚Äô, especially for the junior batches. First & foremost, believe in yourself & know your worth! Never let your CPI or anyone else decide that for you! YOU decide that for yourself! Secondly, I recall meeting certain folks with a very pessimistic attitude right before the placement season, as if they‚Äôd already given up on placements or left it upon fortune to get placed! PLEASE DO NOT BE SUCH A PERSON! Having the right attitude is important! Always remember, half the battle is won or lost in our minds! Lastly, (bear with me please :P) know that mental health issues are REAL! That it‚Äôs okay if you are facing any such issues. I want you to know that it‚Äôs absolutely fine to seek professional help, to see a counsellor, therapist, or a psychiatrist, whenever you feel the need to. Never shy away from such problems, rather, accept them, confront them, and try to get past them. That‚Äôs precisely the reason why I shared my story related to mental health in this piece.",
      "Lastly, don‚Äôt forget to have fun and make fond memories. When you‚Äôll be at the edge of the shore, having completed your journey, it‚Äôs these sweet memories that you‚Äôll carry forward with yourself for the rest of your lives. With this, I end my piece.",

      "Prajual Maheshwari is a final year undergraduate in the Economics department. Let‚Äôs have a look at his journey at IIT Kanpur and live the nostalgia and reminiscence with him.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "‚ÄúStriving for Success without hard work is like trying to harvest when haven‚Äôt planted‚Äù ‚Äï David Bly",
      "It is yet another academic year‚Äôs end for IITK, but I still can‚Äôt believe that my journey as a student of IITK has finished. It has been a long journey (6 yrs = 2 yrs of coaching and 4 yrs of graduation) and now I stand here at the beginning of a new one.¬† I still remember my arrival at the Hall 2 gate and glancing over ‚ÄúBakati‚Äù as I walked over it (didn‚Äôt have any idea about it at that time). The first time I met my ‚ÄúBaapu‚Äù. Let me stop being nostalgic otherwise, there can be a whole list of these first-timer memories.",
      "",
      "My journey at IITK started with a pretty common goal of branch change. Obviously, the target was CSE but I somehow managed to get into Economics. When you work hard for a goal you will end up missing on something else, that‚Äôs quite natural. It is very important to understand that you can‚Äôt do it all. So, In my opinion, always check your priorities and then get to work with all you have got.",
      "As everyone believes that Economics is the most easygoing department of IITK majorly driven by two reasons, first being our relatively chill acads and second being non-lab courses during the 3rd and 4th year. I also agree with these popular opinions. The first reason is mostly pushed by the set of people who have done only one introductory course ECO101A which is offered by a relatively friendly professor. These people extrapolate this sedate experience to the entire department. Campus community on large doesn‚Äôt distinguish between a BS and a Btech degree but when some of my friends point this out by saying, ‚Äú‡§§‡•Ç‡§®‡•á IIT ‡§ú‡•ç‡§µ‡•â‡§á‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä, ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§§‡•Ç ‡§á‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à!‚Äù then I counter them with, ‚Äú‡§§‡•Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§á‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞‡§ï‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ?‚Äù",
      "The Kick-Off Days",
      "I don‚Äôt know why it happened to me, I came last to my triple sharing room in hall 2 and by CS grace I was sharing it with my two Andhra room-mates. They used to talk to each other in Telugu simply ignoring me as if I don‚Äôt exist and the worst part was that the entire Andhra community used to assemble in my room and discuss their jokes (and I always felt that they were talking about me). They are still my accidental friends. Anyways things got settled in the first couple of days. I was soon mingled with my wingies (obviously equations have changed quite a bit from there). In my opinion, this process becomes so easy because we all share a lot in common unknowingly.",
      "",
      "When acads started to kick-off, I was like it would not be too difficult based on the popular myth, ‚ÄúIIT ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§≤‡§æ‡§á‡§´ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à‚Äù but soon I realized that it is not the case and I once pointed this to my bapu who certainly changed the mindset. He said, ‚Äú‡§§‡•Ç IIT ‡§Ü‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡§®‡§æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§§‡§æ, ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§§‡•ã ‡§µ‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ó‡§à ‡§ï‡•Ä music ‡§ï‡•á ‡§á‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•Ä‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§°‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∂‡§® ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§∞, ‡§§‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§ó‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ñ‡§®‡§æ‚Äù. This simple argument made an impact and I was able to convince myself that I will have to study in order to do good here.",
      "That one Friend",
      "One thing I have experienced and observed is you will always have that one friend who will be there to support you in every walk of life, he/she will be there to listen to you whatever shit you are talking and if there is someone to listen to you, I believe most of the problems are themselves solved. That friend knows all going on inside you and this friend can genuinely give you an unbiased opinion. If you have not found such a buddy than believe me your life at IITK will be much more stressful. In my case, it is my IITK brother Shashank Shekhar.",
      "",
      "Apart from this all-time friend, I had some other friends like the ones who are ready for a night-out during exams, a 4 AM chai at DOAA, and some for regular bulla sessions. Then come our room-mates and wingies. The regular blast I used to have in our wing (some really random shit or some pranks) and then laughing over it for hours was really something I loved.",
      "Transformation is a journey, not a destination",
      "I believe that these 4 years have transformed me into an extrovert, which I really appreciate because in my opinion if you want to achieve something, you should know how to let your audience know about it otherwise, no one knows what is going within you. This extrovert personality helped me connect easily with mates and others.",
      "",
      "The shift in mindset is pretty much apparent from the variation in the concerns we have during our IITK stay. I still remember, my first-year thoughts were mostly about going to this club‚Äôs session, or to that club‚Äôs workshop, that changed to which prof to approach for projects and how. What will be the best thing possible for second-year summer that will also help in third-year interns? Later on, placement profiles and their preparation came up as questions during the third-year. And it doesn‚Äôt end here during the 7th semester, questions regarding going for CAT, GMAT or GRE for further studies occupied my mind.",
      "I was once mad to get a project from some professor and once I got it, after some time I lost complete interest in it and now whenever I see that prof. I just try to get clear myself from him. This hide and seek has got its own fun.",
      "Spend Your Time Well",
      "As a regular timepass, I along with my friends walk around the campus during the night (just to chill), sometimes to Mama Mio other times to OAT. But these long overnight walks become much more interesting during Antaragni or Techkriti (I hope u understand why). Sometimes I used to get terrified with the fact that ‚Äú‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¶‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´‡§º 4 ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à, ‡§´‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ ‡§π‡•à‚Äù but still we all live in that moment.",
      "",
      "There is no secret sauce to my decent CPI. It is obvious to score well consistently you will have to study. Now as a matter of fact when to study is the question, as most of us just study when the exams or quizzes arrive (it requires some level of brilliance as well) and some of us study regularly (popularly known as ‚ÄúMaggu‚Äôs‚Äù). Both these methods can lead to high CPI but the later one can have a long-lasting impact on us in terms of academics whereas the former one provides us with some free time during the semester for a chill. It‚Äôs up to you to which one to choose.",
      "As a child I was always fascinated with flying objects, so when I first came to IITK, I joined the aeromodelling club and I along with the help of club secy made a flying plan but that was the end of this aeromodelling journey (as making it was more of a labour job than enjoyment). Then as time passed I became a student guide and a company coordinator at SPO. But later on I failed to make it to the 3rd year team of CS and SPO both (they are themselves a story). So, finally, without any POR, I started working for some shitty stuff in Antaragni (Informals head) and techkriti, but after a few days, I got the opportunity to become the coordinator of the Finance Discussion Group. This field interested me and I tried to make an impact on campus with this. Hence I tried to increase the clubs reach and during the final semester even organized a ‚ÄòNon-Core Weekend‚Äô (although the footfall was low because of Galaxy). I am really thankful to Sachin Angural, Ishan Jharkharia, Adhavan, Jay Gupta, Shubham Gupta, and Shaurya Jain (a few supporters from Gymkhana as well) for making this happen.",
      "",
      "All fingers are not equal",
      "",
      "My journey at IITK (and for that matter everyone‚Äôs) was full of ups and downs. One such period in my case was the internship and placement season. The preparation period can be the most frustrating of all. There can be scenarios like you had a dream company and it didn‚Äôt come for placements or intern for that year (although you can always apply off-campus it is never too easy) or you might screw their exams or even if everything went well they might not shortlist you for some shit reason. It happens but there‚Äôs nothing much you can do at that time. If you really like something, work hard for it (or rather smart) and get there eventually. It is just a matter of a bit more struggle, if you can get into an IIT, you can really beat all the odds and get there where you want to be. Remember‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change the direction of the wind, but you can adjust the sails to always reach your destination‚Äù ‚Äï Jimmy Dean",
      "I have faced some situations where things didn‚Äôt go the way I wanted them to and that happens with everyone all the time, You never know what‚Äôs there for you in the future. With time I have realized to prepare for the worst, if everything goes well you will be great but if things went wrong, you will feel bad (which is obvious) but maybe not to that extent. Get inspired by your failures and try to work hard to get things you want.",
      "Words of Wisdom",
      "All these words are coming from different seniors and I have found them relevant in my life.",
      "IITK has provided me with a lot of opportunities in every field. Sometimes having choices is good but it also creates a lot of dilemmas when deciding which one to choose. Thanks to all my seniors and peers for all the Gyan sessions for guiding me through these hard choices. This place surrounds you with such a brilliant group of peers from such a diverse mindset and interaction with them transforms one‚Äôs thinking.",
      "This place is always going to be within me. The helpful seniors, peers, and lovely juniors I have met here. The ‚Äú‡§™‡§æ‡§ó‡§≤‡§™‡§Ç‡§§‡•Äi‚Äù we all did here will always remain an irresistible part of me ‚Äì ‚Äú‡§Ø‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§Ü‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à!‚Äù. Y16 as a batch has seen a lot, the batch which started with a protest on campus and ended with COVID-19 (not to mention much more in between). Thanks to all my juniors, seniors, batchmates and professors (with whom I have interacted) for making my journey a memorable one and thanks for supporting me always.",

      "I must have been in standard 7 when I first met with this term IIT and the entrance exam called IIT-JEE from my elder brother who was preparing for the same. Around that time only the movie 3 Idiots was released and that was when I first got to know a few things about college life.

All the way I stared out of the window, trying to recollect memories from my last visit when suddenly, the car took a sharp left turn and stopped after a few meters. I heard the sound of an incoming train and asked my uncle how far the campus was. He replied that we had already arrived at the IIT main gate and I, to be honest, was more shocked than happy XD. Back then, I think, any first-time visitor would have found it hard to locate the IIT entrance from a distance. IIT campus was everything opposite to Kanpur city in terms of cleanliness or pollution. Ajinkya, a final-year UG at that time, used to live in my neighborhood and had told me beforehand about the hostels, rooms, facilities at IITK. So seeing the very confined living space didn‚Äôt startle me as much. Saksham Sharma, my student guide, became my first friend and I remember this one time when out of curiosity I went to OAT on the very next day of my arrival and he came looking for me there just to make sure than any senior year student didn‚Äôt catch hold of me XD. The first¬†few days at a campus could be very tiring for any freshman, perhaps a bit more for Hall 2 junta XD. Queuing for quad sessions, sophomores sharing fundae on every aspect of campus life, mythbusters, all became a daily act. Indeed some seniors seemed to be scary during the first few exchanges but as time eventually flew, they became my best friends :‚Äô).",
      "",
      "Academics at IIT Kanpur was one of the things to be honest I was a bit scared about. I had heard a lot about the rigorous academics of IITK from my mentors back when I was preparing. For the first few days, I was always a bit anxious about the courses and used to often question myself on how to find my own approach to tackle the situation. I still remember the disappointment on my face when I got my first MTH & HSS quizzes marks. I called back home and told my dadeverything. He listened patiently and reminded me of a very famous verse from Bhagavad Gita on karma and told me to accept, learn from failures, and celebrate even small victories in life. It took me a while to develop my approach and the experience has taught me to be a lot more appreciative of, tiny as they are, the good things happening. It happened a lot that in some semesters I performed well and in the following semester things turned really bad but only to get better again. Ability to perceive the various problems, academics, or otherwise, as an opportunity to grow takes time to develop and I was no exception. No matter how bad things may get, there‚Äôs always something positive that can be learned.",
      "",
      "I had been taking an active participation in quizzing events since school days and was naturally inclined towards continuing it in college too. I became an active member of the Quiz Club and loved taking part in various inter-hall and inter-college events. Nihilanth, an inter IIT-IIM quizzing event that provided me not only an opportunity to interact with some of the best quizzing minds in the country, but also develop a closer bond with fellow club mates. I went on to become one of the club secretaries in my sophomore year. I also had short term engagements with Vox Populi, Prayas, and E-Cell around that time. While reporting the inter-IIT aquatics meet water polo match between IITK and IITB, I literally had goosebumps seeing the immense home crowd support and memories of it are still alive in my mind. In my third year, I took up the responsibility as one of the Robogames Manager in Techkriti. Robogames is one of the flagship events of Techkriti and making it a success was indeed challenging. Despite the many ups & downs in the process, I never lost the support of members in the team. Further, in my fourth year, I worked as Head at the Society of Aerospace Engineers IITK, which gave me a platform not only to implement my ideas but also hone up my leadership skills. Overall, these experiences helped me learn how to strike a balance between academics and co-curricular commitments. Owing to which, I continued to be a part of the SAE and SPO teams in my fifth year, leading as a UG Vice President and as a Department Placement Coordinator respectively.",
      "",
      "In my third sem I took an HSS course under Prof. G. Neelakantan which helped me develop an immense interest in the field of literature. Prof. Neelakantan is amongst the most down to earth people I‚Äôve met on campus. In subsequent semesters I took more English literature courses and would now graduate with a minor in it. While doing these courses I had a self- realization that it‚Äôs the interest in a course that matters the most. Constantly worrying about grades every time after quizzes, exams had become one of the reasons for my underperformance. Grades and everything else should account for the consequences, and not the cause. Sooner one comes to terms with this fact, easier would it be to make a way through. During the second year of summer, I got an opportunity to work under Prof. Sanjay Mittal on Sports Ball Aerodynamics. It was mainly an experimental study where I got hands-on experience in operating the National Wind Tunnel. The experience was quite enriching which further helped me to work on a company-funded project in my third year summers. In the 6th semester, I finally decided to convert my programme to B.Tech-M.Tech dual degree in Aerospace Engineering itself. The option of having a separate PG CPI which is often used for placement shortlisting, and also the privilege of being eligible for a greater pool of job profiles requiring either bachelors or master level qualification, helped me make this decision. The provision of doing a selective set of PG level courses also gave me an opportunity to efficiently plan the further academic course of action. In retrospect, the extra year I had because of the dual degree, gave me more time to figure out my interests, build up my skill set and certainly backed me in becoming a much more confident individual.",
      "",
      "In my 7th semester, I took an elective course under Prof. Rakesh Kumar. Impressed as I was with him, it was around that time we were asked to submit our thesis guide selection form and I approached him for the same. He was highly welcoming and even suggested an experimental¬†study on high-speed flows. I explored the supersonic jet facility and found the research problem a particularly interesting one to work upon. I was able to present my research work at the 6th National Symposium on Shock Waves, held at IIT Madras, which couldn‚Äôt have been possible without the support of my fellow NFSL IITK labmates. The individual lab presentations, group discussions were all indeed very helpful.",
      "",
      "Of all the people, I am blessed to have around me the most humble, hard-working people, my fellow aero mates Tarundeep, Rishabh, Saakaar, Aditya, Yazur, Manish, Gurpreet, Ram who became my best buddies with time and were, hands down, always there to help me out fight my fears. I also want to thank others who have helped me through thick and thin and made my stay at IITK a memorable one :-). Though there can be no comparison among friends, there was always one person on campus, Aadrish Sharma, with whom I had innumerous bulla sessions and night outs. Though we attended the same school, it was only at IITK that we became best of friends. On day 1 of campus placements, he helped me a lot in giving a final touch to my interview preparation. I remember when I came out after giving the final HR round for the senior analyst profile at JPMorgan, being confident of the selection, he was happier than me and even started planning for the celebration as he was supposed to leave in a day or so. But things didn‚Äôt turn out as expected and I couldn‚Äôt make it to the list of the final four candidates. I was disheartened, but lucky enough to have a buddy like him to boost my confidence up once again. Thankfully, the next day, the celebration did happen as I was able to ace all the interview rounds and finally got an offer from Myntra Jabong.",
      "My journey at IITK has surely been quite a memorable one filled with moments of happiness and sadness, achievements, and failures, but they all, each and everyone, count as an experience. The precious moments I got to share with my friends at IITK are no less valuable than a treasure, and I would keep on carrying the memories of them in my heart in this lifetime and beyond. A quote by Helen Keller perfectly sums it up ‚Äì So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart, I shall say that life is good.",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "Here I am thinking about my entire journey of IITK, an odyssey to be precise, thinking about how I got through many of the difficult times, and yet here I feel that coming up with the right beginning of this article has to be the most difficult one. Now when I am backtracking my journey, the very first exciting memory that comes to my mind was my interaction with seniors. Like many of the noobs of IITK, I was also terrified of the things I had heard about how the interaction goes. Unlike some lucky people, I was not able to escape this interaction. Well, I was not the only one who was part of this interaction, my ‚ÄúBhai‚Äù Akhilesh Gupta (Y16, MSE) was also there to make this event even more interesting. What happened is something we swore to keep a secret. Now that I am recalling this memory, I guess I was the lucky one to have experienced this phase of IITK.",
      "Like most people, I had a terrible academic start. I think the main reason for that was my sheer overconfidence. In my first lecture of MTH101, I was taught that ‚Äúthere exists a rational number between two real numbers‚Äù. This struck me hard. Almost a year before I was solving some mind-boggling problems in mathematics, and here I am proving the obvious things. Similarly, in the first lab of TA101, I was writing ‚ÄúABCD‚Ä¶.‚Äù. These things made me drip with overconfidence, and I screwed up my semester. But that just was the starting point on my academic graph. In the end, it comes down to students whether they wish to see the graph climbing up or sink¬†further. I know many of you like myself must have heard that it is difficult to increase your CPI after the second year. Let me tell you this the most depressing and fallacious rumor you will come across during your time at IITK. The credits in all the semesters are almost the same meaning you have an equal opportunity every semester.",
      "Unlike a large group of students, I knew where I wanted to be at the end of this journey, and most of my academic decisions were directed towards achieving this goal. While I was filling out the choices as to which IIT and which branch to choose I had one thing in mind, ‚Äúmy goal‚Äù, to be able to get into Astronomy and I think it is self-explanatory that I was looking for institutes which were good in research and finally landed up at IITK. There are many research aspirants out there who are willing to work in interdisciplinary fields (in my case Astrochemistry), and it can be achieved by a scrupulous exploration of one‚Äôs own as well as other departments. I have seen people who had great potential to excel in research but lost their interest. The one reason that I have seen common in many cases is that people take UGPs under some professors. If the professor turns out to be someone who is not student-friendly consequently, by the end, students come to the conclusion that research is not suited for them. Don‚Äôt let this be the case.",
      "In my third year, while everyone around me was able to secure an internship, I was still mailing different professors in search of a research internship. My third year almost came to an end, and I was still not able to secure an internship. So rather than wasting my summer doing nothing, I decided to do some courses at IITK in the summer and prepare for GRE. To all those out there who are in search of a research internship, don‚Äôt feel disheartened if you are not able to secure one.¬†It is possible to build a good research profile by working on projects at IIT Kanpur as well and that is exactly what I did and it finally helped me secure a PhD position at the University of Arizona.",
      "",
      "I think I have given too much academic advice which I don‚Äôt know if it should have been a part of ‚ÄúAs I leave‚Äù. Let‚Äôs get into some Chill zone and talk about something apart from academics. No matter how much you get into academics, in the end, most of your cherished memories would be the time spent with your friends. IITK has given me friends who are ready to take GPL for no good reason. Currently, I am at my home drafting this article and all I can think of is to make the best of the months that I have left with my friends. After grinding the 7th semester (the most crucial one), we were prepared to go wild this semester, but this quarantine has been a colossal blockade.",
      "",
      "The fun at IITK begins with Orientation. You get to know about different clubs and hobby groups and the institute as a whole. I associated myself with the Astronomy club as it inclined with my interests. I guess the entire Y16 batch has their very first HEC meeting engraved in their memory; the ‚ÄúSingle Room with A/C‚Äù meeting. Being associated with an SnT club, the first significant event for me was Takneek. I experienced my first night out during Takneek. As soon we were free from our event, we were rushed to the common room to help out with the preparations of Rube Goldberg, and this is what happened during the entire Takneek. I think a thank you note for the HEC is in order for creating these wonderful memories. But after witnessing all these inter-hall competitions for four years, the major regret would be that I can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúMarathas forever‚Äù or ‚ÄúHall 10 forever‚Äù. I know it is essential to take academics seriously, but fun and academics can go hand-in-hand if one has the motive.",
      "",
      "I would like to conclude by saying¬†you have four years to be irresponsible here, relax. Work is for people with jobs. You‚Äôll never remember class time, but you‚Äôll remember the time you wasted hanging out with your friends. So stay out late. Go out with your friends on a Tuesday when you have a paper due on Wednesday. Spend money you don‚Äôt have. The work never ends, but college does‚Ä¶",

      "As I clicked on the Google doc link saved by my browser due to its frequent use, I came face to face with ‚ÄòVani JS Weekly Lab Report‚Äô. Yes, that is the doc I have most frequently opened, my weekly lab report. It is a privilege of only the higher classes, as they say, the postgraduates. As I tried opening a new doc, the report stared back at me, seeming both daunting and nostalgic for it missed being updated. Since the past one month or even longer, there have been no updates, no briefings, no anxious waiting for my advisor‚Äôs reply. The ongoing pandemic has brought a complete twist in our very usual to-be-graduate lives.",
      "I, being, one of the few unfortunate or fortunate people, who were supposed to hold a degree in their hands by this summer, are right now stuck at our own homes, far away from the routines of working in a lab, on a forced break to maybe plan out experiments in a more systematic and meticulous manner? I‚Äôd say that life of a postgraduate, in general, might revolve only around their respective labs, no, no, pardon my words, it is not that small a world, but not bigger than their respective departments. Again unfortunately or fortunately, that is the life of a usual PG student. Or maybe that is how they choose to live it. But for me, it was not so limited.",

      "Just like the unlimited fun of a roller coaster ride, enrollment in a Master‚Äôs degree didn‚Äôt fail me to give the same jitterbugs, I swear. Given the mere two-years time alongside pitying my fellow dual-degree mates with a year lesser, the tale of a brand new masters student at IITK is a little different from the other humans dearly called ‚ÄòCampus Junta‚Äô because they do not have to get acquainted with the nitty-gritties of the campus-working or adjust to the culture shock of a totally new institute with it‚Äôs luring and an endless list of activities or do not have to get lost on the ways inside the campus while completing a full-fledged research thesis under the pressure of a clock continuously ticking away at a pace faster than they can imagine. That was exactly what I felt when I first joined the campus. With dreams of flying abroad, I could only ‚Äòsettle‚Äô for an IIT. Though not long after, I realized it was one of the best decisions, to come to this place no less than an entire city. I can not do without using another cliche, that IIT Kanpur has been the best place of my life so far, and I am very sure it will not lose this status at least in the next 5 decades.",

      "As I am beginning to reminisce, I am flooded with memories of so much that has happened just in a span of these almost two years, drowning me in a whirlpool of emotions. Experience it with me, as I spell out the traces of these beautiful memories, swiping each one to the side as the next one awaits: My parents dropping me off trusting me with the responsibilities of living all alone for the very first time in a hostel, the search for my roommate who had the key to B-506, buying a sparkling white bicycle, getting relieved to see a familiar face from previous interviews, meeting my advisor Prof. Jonaki Sen, struggling to remember the confusing names of all my many labmates in the first go, realizing that I am now a part of one of the coolest labs, ‚ÄòSB Lab‚Äô, of the department, attending the entire orientation week with an enthusiasm meter exploding at all times, meeting my first girlfriend while searching for ‚ÄúSafai vali didi‚Äô, the foundation of ‚ÄòSwag Vale Dost‚Äô and ‚ÄòFukrey‚Äô with the end of Treasure Hunt, the activity of gazing at a mesmerizing star-filled sky becoming the starting of so many new friendships, exploring rooftops, staircases, alleys and corners around the campus to find peace and happiness, throwing farewell to the first and last ever roommate, enjoying living alone in a double-seater room, throwing surprise birthday parties, celebrating festivals with a new-found family, making plans around the daily video calls at home, finding a soulmate amongst best friends, attending and auditing extra classes because there was so much to learn, coming to 8AM classes with raincoats paddling¬†through water filled roads, sitting and having meetings with the famous Prof. H.C. Verma, shifting to GH-1, grinding through thesis and project, living the dichotomy between Developmental Biology and Cognitive Science, gaping-in-awe through weekly guest seminars, preparing for lab meetings, having anxiety and panic-stricken breakdowns but getting pushed higher up by friends, taking care of eggs, days and nights of electroporation, having a gallery filled with gel images, spending time filling lab notebooks and labeling my samples with superhero names, going on a trip to Varanasi, helping to organize the Open House, having fun during all kinds of big and small fests and finally, booking tickets for home without booking return tickets which always used to be the first priority. Sigh. The dreary night before I left campus due to an impending lockdown still sends shivers down my spine.",
      "But nonetheless, I am glad it‚Äôs not the end yet which would have been otherwise at this time. If I get a chance, I‚Äôd like to recollect all those memories which are diffused into the fresh pollen-smeared morning air or are lying on the tables of DOAA and hall canteens, those which are there in the rustling of the leaves of the ‚ÄòTila‚Äô, or in the oscillating silence and chitter-chatter of the corridors and classrooms, or there in the echoes of every turn of the skywalk, and the memories outspread in the waiting hours at CCD, without forgetting the satisfaction of using all free drinks at Shiru cafe. I would not miss the chance to embrace the feeling of warmth of the winter sun, the roads on a foggy night, the ineffectiveness of coolers you know when, and of course the failure of rolling up pants in the unforgiving monsoon.",
      "",
      "Before I bid adieu to a bucket full of experiences, I‚Äôd like to share the little wisdom I gained in this time. And so for all the juniors, both present and incoming, all I‚Äôd say is do not take this place for granted, because it will make you fall in love with you before you know it. In this blur of time, I‚Äôve been able to sing a song on Fresher‚Äôs night, dance for the first-time-ever in front of an audience, learn violin, teach in an NGO, be an AnC secy, and an OTM in counselling service, and lastly I could get the sweet fruit of getting to decide which stream to pursue in future. Here, you can be what you want to be, more importantly, what you choose to be. Believe me, a focus on academics with such a rigorous curriculum is rare, show some gratitude and respect to the teachers who are worthy of being called real gurus‚Äô in this modern age. Grab¬†every opportunity you could, because no time could be better than this. Make many friends (I literally banged at the doors of my wingies the very first day just to say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô, took the definition of ‚Äòoutgoing‚Äô quite literally). Make memories, join clubs, sing, read, write, play. Every action verb you learnt in kindergarten, you can make a skill out of it here, remember that. Build your profile, as expected, but make your priority to become an open-minded life-long learner which this place teaches you to be. And never ever pay the cost of your health for anything. Dear ‚ÄòCampus junta‚Äô, I‚Äôll miss this place wherever I go, for it has been a lover so remarkable that the marks etched on my heart would never fade.",

      "Vox Populi brings you the seventh edition of the series Unorthodox Career Choices. We interview people who have taken a leap of faith and bring their stories to you. This edition brings you the story of Devendra Kumar Singh, an alumnus of IITK who completed his M.Tech in 2011. He is an RTI activist and a social worker. He left his engineering job in 2013 and has been since spreading awareness about RTI and helping poor people use this powerful act to fight various frauds. Do give it a read to know more about his journey and how IITK affected his career choice.",
      "After doing B.Tech. and M.Tech. in civil engineering, what moved you to choose this unconventional path? What aroused your interest in law, and specifically RTI?",
      "While doing B.Tech at IET Lucknowin 2007, I came to know about RTI for the first time by reading the lecture papers delivered by Arvind Kejriwal (back then, A.K. was the founder of the NGO Parivartan) as 23rd Kelkar Alumni Lecture in IITK on 25th March 2006. I understood from the papers that it is theremedy for all the corruption in the country. Whenever one of my family members applied for their passport, a policeman used to extort money from my family. I applied for a passport and decided that I will not give a single penny to anyone and use RTI instead, and it actually worked! RTI works beautifully but only a few know about it. Initially, I helped a few people and gradually people started knowing about me and my RTI activism. So, my studies and RTI awareness programs worked parallelly.",
      "After getting a degree from IIT Kanpur, I joined an MNC. I worked in Noida for 2 years as a highway engineer. The work was comfortable. This was the time of the Anti-corruption movement. I got very interested in it. In 2012-13 my company faced an economic slowdown due to lack of government projects. So, we started getting less work. Before resigning from my job in October 2013, I was sitting idle in my office and getting a salary. After I resigned, I came back to Kanpur and started spreading awareness about RTI. I decided to not work in any engineering firm.",
      "From 2014 to 2017, I worked for the poor and helped others in their hard-earned money lost in banking frauds among other problems. That is when I realized that not everything can be solved by RTI. Seeing this, I started trying to contact advocates who would work for free for the poor because I had no money on me and finally in 2017, I decided to study law myself.",
      "",
      "How did your friends and family react to you leaving your job and choosing an unorthodox career?",
      "They were not at all happy. They were worried about how I would get the money, how I would survive, and how I would start a family. I had already decided to not get married after leaving my job. I had seen a childhood of absolute poverty and did not have enough money to buy books for school. We were a family of four brothers and three sisters. My father was the only working member of the family. All of us four brothers got into different IITs and did their M.Techs from there. So, I decided to spend my life for society and let the other siblings live their lives and do whatever they want. I told my family that when we were poor, very few people came to help us. Thus, I am going to spend my life for the betterment of other poor people. It took a lot of time to convince my family but they did come around eventually. All the work that I was doing was being told to them as stories, in newspapers, on T.V., etc and at times, by the person affected themselves. They started supporting me and told me to be happy with what I was doing.",
      "",
      "What is the process that you use to spread awareness among youth and in remote areas about RTI?",
      "Social media is a good tool in the right hands. I use Twitter and Facebook for this purpose, to spread awareness about RTI. They tell others in need about me. I don‚Äôt know most of the people who come to me. At times, they come from faraway places like Raebareli and Meerut and we stay connected through Facebook and emails. We stay in constant touch and the only thing that matters to me is that people who need help should be given that. This awareness is getting stronger day by day.",
      "",
      "How do you describe the feeling when someone comes to you with a problem and you are able to solve it using RTI?",
      "That feeling is the most precious feeling. For me, that is the reward I am getting. People always say that they‚Äôre lucky since they received my help. I should say that for me, it is the smile on their face after their problem is solved, that becomes my ultimate reward.",
      "",
      "Winning is certainly not always possible in the field of public work so how do you deal with the loss or the injustice? What is the mantra that keeps you going?",
      "Winning is certainly not always possible. I have been successful with simple cases like ATM fraud. When the problem becomes complicated, for example, let‚Äôs say there is an unpaved road of 100m that needs to be constructed and paved, you cannot get it constructed using RTI. You can file a request in the respective department and then file an RTI to get information on what has been done about the request, but the only answer you‚Äôll get is that they do not have funds. If the funds are available with the local MLA or the local MP, you can go to that authority, explain your problem to them but nothing is generally done about it. At such times, helplessness sets in, but doing nothing about it is not the solution. I believe that I should keep going in whatever capacity I can. I may not have done big things but I have done a lot of small things that matter. This example is quite personal as the roads in the area of Kanpur, where I reside, turn to ponds during every rainy season. I have tried everything but because those who hold power have become so powerful, they choose to do nothing. The only thing that can be done is not voting for them but sadly voting in India is not based on the candidate but the political party he/she belongs to.",
      "Last year, I contested the by-elections of the Govindnagar seat of Legislative assembly and came fifth among nine participants, behind all the big parties. I knew I would not win but the point was to get myself heard, that people in power should work for the people. So my mantra is that failures aside, one should not stop and do whatever little they can do.",
      "",
      "How important do you find RTI in a common person‚Äôs life? What are your views on the accessibility of RTI to a common person? How convenient do you find it?",
      "RTI is necessary for those who aren‚Äôt being listened to by any of the government departments. Suppose you send a parcel to Kanpur by speed post on the 15th of June. It‚Äôs not delivered until 30th June. When you try to track it, the only information you could seek is that it was booked on June 15 at Delhi. There are no further updates. To search for the contact of the concerned post offices seems the only viable option and if you still don‚Äôt get a satisfactory response, you can now take the help of RTI. You just need to surf the website, fill a form with a payment of Rs. 10, and ask for the required information. RTI can‚Äôt only be used to fight corruption; it can also be used to collect any data that is under public authority.",
      "",
      "You have worked on the ground, seen and met people who have no idea what the general policies are all about. What are your thoughts about that?",
      "There‚Äôs a clause in the RTI act named Voluntary Disclosure or sometimes Mandatory Disclosure. Under this clause, information about new policies must be communicated through respective public domains and must be updated on a yearly basis. The idea is to put this kind of information in the public domain so as to reduce the number of RTI applications concerning related information.",

      "I‚Äôve given many public lectures about RTI. During these speeches, many cross-questions were raised. I thought that I should create a handbook comprising all such questions and answers. The book informs people about the procedure of filing an RTI clearly. A major portion of that book is dedicated to what a law code says about the provisions and the popular words used during the RTI process. During one of my cases, I was withheld from the information by the use of technical jargon. I could figure out the illegitimacy only because I‚Äôd had enough knowledge of RTI and law. I‚Äôve focused on these kinds of issues while writing the book. My book titled ‚ÄúRight to Information Act ‚Ä¶in simple words‚Äù is designed for those who have heard about RTI but never filed one because they don‚Äôt know how to get the information and efficiently write an RTI application. I have published it on Amazon and is available in Hindi as well as in English, in both paperback and ebook formats.",

      "After completing your law degree, what are your future goals? Where do you see yourself in 10 years?",
      "In 10 years, I see myself as a working lawyer, advocate going into litigation, charging those who can pay and giving service for free to those who can‚Äôt pay. Along with that, helping people by spreading awareness among people about RTI. I‚Äôve previously fought an election just to give them a message whatever they‚Äôre doing is not acceptable to us. I am not planning to get into politics, but if the need arises, I‚Äôll enter into politics.",
      "",
      "Now that you‚Äôre in the field of law, does the knowledge gained from your engineering days help you in any manner?",
      "I see a striking similarity between law and mathematics. In mathematics, you need to understand the formulas and then understand which formula is to be applied where. While in law, you should know the provisions of the law, and which section will be applicable in a given case. For example ‚Äì A client may come with a problem that my daughter‚Äôs in-laws are causing her troubles. You should know that the domestic violence act, the dowry act, etc are applicable in this case. Patanjali recently launched a medicine, coronil and they advertised it very well, but there‚Äôs a law formulated in 1954 on magic remedy and misleading advertisement, under which this is a crime. Marriage requires a pandit but divorce requires a law. Everything has a law associated with it. You‚Äôre studying in an IIT, so you‚Äôre being governed by the Indian Institute of Technology act. The laws about buying a property, written wills,¬† maternity benefit act for employees, the sales law, etc are important to lead a normal life. So you need to have a basic knowledge of the law.",

      "Looking back in your life till now, what do you think are some of the biggest lessons the society has taught you?",
      "I am inspired by a Lord Milner quote ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you believe a thing to be bad and if we have the right to prevent it, then it is our duty to try to prevent it and damn the consequences‚Äù. There were four subjects in my M.Tech at IIT Kanpur, 3 compulsory and 1 elective. My professor asked me to choose Finite Element Matter(FEM) as the elective. I didn‚Äôt like it, but the professor insisted on it and we had to reach a compromise which was to take a different course altogether. Next year, the professor was extra cautious and there was no option of an elective. All the juniors failed after the first test in that course. Thus they requested the subject to be changed and the professor forwarded that request to DPGC and I was a part of it at that time. According to the PG manual, the subject could be changed based on two conditions, that is, it has to be changed within 15 days or if the student had not done the prerequisites of the course. The FEM course taken by students didn‚Äôt fulfill both of these conditions. In the meeting, I raised this point. The professors started joking, ‚ÄúKi jab hota nahi, tab lena hi nahi chahiye tha‚Äù. Because of this incident, my M.Tech thesis was affected and my graduation was delayed by 2-2.5 months which later affected my job joining date. So, if something wrong happens, you have to stop it and not look at the consequences.",
      "",
      "Can you tell us about your stay at IITK? Are there any memories of the campus that you would like to share?",
      "IITK was the best part of my life. When I got the admission, I saw that there‚Äôs a gym, swimming pool and a book club. I joined all three in the first month but as the workload increased, I left all of them except the book club. Since I‚Äôm from Kanpur, I used to go home on weekends. Professor used to be angry about this!(laughs). At IITK, there‚Äôs an online system for everything, like, opting form subjects, booking appointments in HC and checking results online. I haven‚Äôt seen this in any other IIT. In IITD, for the monthly stipend, you just have to show that you‚Äôre present. In IITK, you have to do a TA duty for 8 hours a week and work in labs every day. Even in research, you must work hard to get passed. I decided to join the Ph.D. program at IITK and even got selected, but then I remembered those 15 days when my degree got extended and I was in the lab for 15 days and didn‚Äôt even go to my hostel. So I decided not to join the program. The workload would‚Äôve been too much.",
      "",
      "What message would you like to give to the IITK community?",
      "Since childhood, we yearn for security. We were told in high school as well as 12th to study well as those marks will be useful everywhere. I was told to study well in my B.Tech, to get a good job. Both my brothers had done an M.Tech, which created a psychological pressure on me to clear GATE. My father died 2 days before the GATE exam in 2008. That year I could not get a good enough rank to get into an IIT. Next year, I had even more pressure. I went for the campus placement and got a job to get that ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô in life. Once you have that IIT tag, you‚Äôve got that security. I‚Äôve been part of this blind race, I did everything until then because I was running to meet the standards set by my family. My siblings did M.Tech, I did it too. They didn‚Äôt do LLB, I didn‚Äôt even know about it. They did CE, I did CE. After joining the job, I did what I wanted to do. So after getting this security, think about what your heart wants and then move in that direction. Even if you‚Äôll fall in that direction, you‚Äôll not fall too behind. This is the privilege of IIT students. Your mind and heart should be in the same place.",

      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "As I sit to write this, I don‚Äôt know whom to address this to? Are you here just for a story of just another IITK undergrad or a junior seeking advice? You are more likely to find good career advice from many other people writing their accounts. What I am writing is going to be devoid of advice applicable in the conventional sphere, and what little I offer, I can‚Äôt attest to its utility. With the long preface out of the way, stick around for more if you wish.",
      "I am graduating with a Physics degree, but I joined as a Civil Engineering undergraduate and honestly, there is no convincing argument I can put forth to explain why Civil and not Physics in the first place? But I somehow chose Civil. Again, for no particular rational reasons, I joined the Dramatics club. I was also a part of the Antaragni Nukkad team for which the practice lasted long hours. I did not pay much heed to my academics. The inevitable happened, my academics suffered. Because I was constantly away for dramatics practice, I had very little interaction with my wing mates. And initially, I felt out of place in my own wing. There were also some incidents where my wing mates‚Äô behavior was far from appropriate and that further fueled a mutual feeling of resentment.",
      "",
      "With a bad semester past me, I should have focused on getting my academics back on track but there was inexplicable pressure to participate in the Galaxy Nukkad now. I bowed to the pressure, but I fared relatively better than the first semester. I had made my mind that this was my last involvement with the Dramatics club, and maybe the last non-academic involvement. I wasn‚Äôt suffering but wasn‚Äôt flourishing either. I was very low on confidence. I used to reject myself before someone else could do that for me. I did not go for the SG interview because I didn‚Äôt see why someone would want me to be one. I was not going to apply to get my branch changed to Physics only because I ‚Äúknew‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt get it anyway. I remember being at the benches near the HC and it took a friend (Shreya) quite a lot of convincing to even have me apply for a branch change. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the application is just a few clicks. No SOPs, no recommendations. And that is how, miraculously (to me then), I became a Physics undergraduate. Over the semester and the following summer, I spent some quality time with my wing mates. Your usual wing activities such as playing CS till sunrise, random bulla sessions, and playing Mafia all night. All of this is just another iteration of bad decisions and the value of a good support system around you (even if the entire system is just one person at times).",
      "",
      "With most of the initial hiccups past me and a string of bad decisions, I finally took one of the most rewarding decisions at IITK. I joined Vox. Prior to this, my only interaction with seniors had been with those in the HEC and the Dramatics Club, the first day in Vox was honestly a bit disorienting. The atmosphere was welcoming and respectful. I had no clear plan then and even hindsight is not 20/20 but it was one of the reasons I stuck around. The following year, I took up more responsibility and became an editor. At Vox, I had the chance to work with and learn from many seniors, juniors, and batch mates. Some of them I developed a close kinship with as well. Vox guarantees to be that for almost everyone. Or at least I hope it does. But I got more out of Vox than just that. By observing the system up close, I could see the glaring faults.",
      "",
      "Over the past two years (and beyond?) we have witnessed objectionable overreach by the institute authority. There is quite a lot of infighting among students (which, to an extent, can be healthy). And the student community (The UGs at least) are not organized. Admittedly, I too had not done much before it affected people I particularly care about. The student population is dynamic, that is, in 4-5 years, almost all students (particularly the UGs) are replaced and that is both the best and the worst thing about bringing about a change. The things that we want to get rid off could go extinct if just the new batches do the right thing. But it also makes it very easy for the negative to become the norm. The ubiquitous CCTV cameras being the case in point.",
      "There is no way for students to systematically organize and make their collective voices heard. I understand that many, if not most people are here to have fun, learn, get a job, and earn a good life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But I think we can be more vigilant while ensuring all that. Be aware about what is happening, stand up for the right things, be informed, and inform others about what is going on. This reminds me of when about 2 years back, when I was interviewing a certain senior named Ayush Mukherjee for an ‚ÄòAs we leave..‚Äô just like the one I am writing right now, he said ‚ÄúEven if you have to be a mute spectator, at least be a spectator.‚Äù And I would want to reiterate just that. There is no point in blaming anyone except admitting and trying to fill the vacuum that exists in the student body. Maybe the Gymkhana, maybe Vox, maybe Nirvaak or a new body altogether or some combination thereof needs to fill this vacuum. IITK needs to be a place where the system is fair by design and does not rely on the benevolence of those with far-reaching power.",
      "Having ridden the high-horse of being informed and aware, there is so much more to IITK than I knew or currently know. For a long time, ‚Äòcampus community‚Äô for me was synonymous to the students, and that too, mainly the UGs (and that too just the boys?). What expanded that for me was a year at Prayas. I could see how people lived so close to me geographically and so far away metaphorically. All of this just points out how there are so many avenues to be better as a community. We live in an overtly and unapologetically sexist campus. A little less overtly casteist campus. In any way, you use your privilege here to address these issues, goes a long way in making it better for those left behind.",
      "",
      "My life here and the observations therein have not been all grim (as I might have made them sound). I have had my share of fun. On a personal level, a lot of things simply fell into place lately. I don‚Äôt know how much of that had to do with my efforts and how much of it was just the right circumstances. I was your average joe as a student. Doing well in some courses and struggling in others. But the summer after my 3rdyear and the 7thsemester proved to be surprisingly fruitful. I gained some research experience in the field I am interested in, could even have (albeit a bit shabby) publications. Got through a harrowingly stressful time of grad school applications and then got into a decent enough university.",
      "",
      "At IITK, I also developed great friendships that I hope will last a long time. The camaraderie that I share will stay with me forever. My friends in my wing, with whom I have spent many hours trying to one-up each other, support one another and even try to cook a few things. Have had many discussions and arguments with them where I am your friendly neighborhood paragraph writing brainwashed liberal/leftist. My friends in my department, especially Nachiket Karve who has helped me in numerous courses and is a great friend and an even better human. I have also had Shreya‚Äôs unwavering support and those occasional reality checks. I am truly grateful for all that, and the way I have grown over my 4 years here. And I think in return, there are ways we can help make the community better. I am not trying to be a fashionable non-conformist here, just trying to leverage my howsoever unique experience to provide a perspective and (hopefully) make a point.",
      "",
      "Goodbye IITK. I hope when I look back on my 4 years here, I see a lot many good things I glossed over turn out to be valuable life lessons, and all of which I fret over, become irrelevant.",

      "Yash Mahajan is a final year undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering department. Let‚Äôs have a look at his journey at IIT Kanpur and live the nostalgia and reminiscence with him.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "NOTE: The author has a tendency to often exaggerate and overstate things, so things may not be as extreme in real life as they have been mentioned here.",
      "",
      "I procrastinated writing this for a long time hoping that I would get the motivation back when I would return to the campus. I figured that the feeling of nostalgia during the last few days on campus would hit me and help me in penning down thoughts about my stay at IIT-K. I was still trying to look on the bright side, but as time went on and the future became more apparent, it dawned on me that we had all left without realising it and it was painful to accept it. I wondered the reason behind the feelings of numbness, void and emptiness I was experiencing because unlike many others (but like many other people?) my stay hasn‚Äôt been entirely pleasant or nice. Life wasn‚Äôt as sunny and hopeful as I had expected, or maybe it wasn‚Äôt just for me.",
      "It was hard to find a reason behind my newfound love for IIT-K, sure I had some good times, but whenever I looked back at my campus life so far before now, it was also mixed with dark, depressing and lonely moments. So, I tried to introspect about why my college life wasn‚Äôt what I had hoped for it to be before coming here, and why I was a lonely, unhappy, stressed and anxious wreck for a majority of my stay here. People usually view their experiences in a positive light in hindsight, or they try to, but that wasn‚Äôt easy for me to do. So, I decided to go through my past 4 years from the beginning to the abrupt end to understand it better.",
      "And it is what I decided I wanted to write about. My personal experiences/story is really routine and remarkably ordinary. Because let‚Äôs be honest a story about a slightly introverted CSE guy with very few extracurricular activities ending up with a ‚Äúcoding‚Äù job at the end of his degree is not really exciting or anything new. I thought it would be much better to instead express what I felt over these last couple of years.",
      "I came here with some dreams and aspirations as well as expectations from what I wanted in the future. I wanted to excel, and I had built up an image of how I wanted my life to go on ahead, but well, the image got shattered pretty quickly. As it turns out not a single one of them panned out the way I wanted them to. It is disappointing, and I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to this feeling of failure. I had no idea how to deal with the situation. I tried staying in denial and ignoring the disappointment, which only aggravated the situation. Instead of trying to think about what I could do with the cards I was dealt, I instead pretended that the problems didn‚Äôt exist which made it much harder when eventually, the time to face the problem came.",
      "I would also often find myself feeling alone, unable to fit in, and not being able to relate with anyone else. There have been many many days on campus where I have had a very strange feeling of living alone in a sea of strangers. This loneliness has been a constant throughout a large part of my stay here, and it‚Äôs difficult to focus or do anything productive at those times. It‚Äôs challenging to get out of bed, go to classes, or tick off the endless list of to-dos in the campus environment. And I often wondered why it was happening to me or was I alone in that state. My interaction with other people also reduced to null, and I avoided talking to my friends as much as I could. I could, however, always manage to complete my academic tasks and other deadlines, so my academics, as well as some other things, remained consistently good, but that‚Äôs about it. Every other aspect of life would get adversely affected and in some cases, irreversibly. I wouldn‚Äôt feel okay, but contrary to common portrayals that didn‚Äôt imply that I would start screwing up at everything.",
      "There is also the fact the environment is competitive, in most aspects. Even if you try to not pay attention to or compare yourself to others, the nature of internships, placements, etc. is competitive by design, and it brings on a lot of stress regarding the future. Things don‚Äôt always go along your way, you get overwhelmed, and it‚Äôs challenging to deal with the situation at times, which may lead to a nervous breakdown. I often got very flustered because of the stress, and handing it all alone was a harrowing experience. Life isn‚Äôt as binary as it is in the JEE and school days, and the anxiety and the uncertainties regarding what lies ahead are scary. People have different cope-up mechanisms to handle the situation, some people deal with it very calmly, I didn‚Äôt, and so the built-up stress would often blow up. I didn‚Äôt anticipate that the stress might be more than what it was in the JEE days because I was very naive, the fact that the stress never actually goes away also led to some resentment.",
      "A large part of the stress although was my fault, I worried too much about the future, and always assumed that the worst-case scenario would be the most likely one, I would think about imaginary scenarios about the future and get worked up about my lack of possible options. This negativity was very toxic, which I realised much later, and had severe consequences on my well-being.",
      "Now, everyone has bad days or bad weeks that are hard to go through or at least most do. The problem is when the weeks stretch into months and every day seems miserable with no glimmer of hope that things might get better in future. These rough patches were frequent for me, and usually, I couldn‚Äôt figure out the reason why I felt that way. From an outsider‚Äôs perspective, my life didn‚Äôt seem that bad or miserable. I wouldn‚Äôt be in a bad position after graduation by any means, nor was I entirely unproductive for a majority of the time. But with time I have realised that maybe it was mostly because I felt bad that my life wasn‚Äôt going the way I wanted it to, and because I kept everything bottled up inside of me.",
      "You might say that I am being biased and just focusing on only what didn‚Äôt fit in with my picture-perfect dream of college life. I can‚Äôt really disagree with that statement. Indeed, my expectations weren‚Äôt fulfilled, and my stay was a lot more isolated than what I wanted.¬† Nevertheless, It would be a lie if I say that there weren‚Äôt days which were beautiful and fun, or that there weren‚Äôt any highs in this time. Like the many negative periods, there were also lovely, enjoyable phases wherein I was happy, content and satisfied with my current situation and hopeful for what lay onwards. But if I try to calculate the overall score, assigning a positive score to the good memories and negative to the bad ones, the score is way more negative than I had hoped for. So I have deliberately made a choice to just focus on the dark parts instead.",
      "It‚Äôs true that I miss the place, and some people, and I could have very easily written a post filled with campus references and cliches, and layout my journey with details throughout these 4 years mentioning several highs and lows and end on a positive bittersweet note. But I just think that would be me being very dishonest. It would just be nostalgia making me only remember the good times when I am finally leaving and moving on from IIT-K. So thus, there is no happy ending or a twist about how I changed things through or any description of how I have changed a lot from the time I entered the campus. This just isn‚Äôt how life actually goes for most people. Frankly, I haven‚Äôt changed much throughout these 4 years, my personality is the same as what it was around 4 years back in my perspective, and I am leaving this place with a lot of regrets. Sure I learned a lot but was it an experience of a lifetime which I would always remember fondly, as I see right now, maybe not. You might also be finding this end rather abrupt and disappointing. I, on the other hand, think this ending is weirdly fitting for my journey at IIT-K, I didn‚Äôt get the ending or closure that I wanted and maybe you the reader shouldn‚Äôt either.",

As a sudden mist of wistfulness descended upon me, I wondered ‚Ä¶has it really been 4 years?. A date (read day?) forever etched in the hearts of the class of 20‚Äô, it was on this day 4 years back that all our lives became intertwined.",
      "Since the past four months, in our final days at the campus, it seems time is swaying in a lingering sense. Everyone is trying to savour the nostalgia, some are trying to relive the bulla sessions, spending time with their wingies, actualizing their pending treats while people like me are busy exploring places not visited, trying our hands-on things not done; playing squash in the squash court, getting a feel of the wooden flooring of the badminton court, exercising in the gym, walking on the stairs of OAT, visiting our previous hall, its canteen, maybe a visit to FB/LHC rooftops at night? and of course playing cards with wingmates, all the while trying to live everything just once again. Every mundane task appears to be wrapped in a poignant coat.",

      "I still remember the day I bid goodbye to my home and left for the train to Kanpur. My father accompanied me, mom decided to stay cause she said she won‚Äôt be able to leave me without poignancy. Now I lived in Kanpur till I was 6, after which we moved away, so coming back after 12 good years brought a reminiscent smile on my face, while dad stood dejected; ‚Äúvaise ka vaisa hi hai !‚Äù. All these tempestuous thoughts about whether I made the right choice or not, maybe should‚Äôve waited for float before freezing choices, ‚ÄòCS mein hi scope hai‚Äô and other contemplations found me standing in the mess registration queue in Hall-5. After getting to know my room no.(C213/5), I got to know my roomie was from mechanical. ‚ÄúBranch CSE nahi mili kam se kam roomie to CSE ka mil jata, kyunki competition hai to focus hai, aur focus hai to dassa‚Äù was the first thought that ran my mind. Little did I know it would be one of my most cherished friendships ever.",

      "For a freshman, I was a bit too harsh on myself. And why wouldn‚Äôt I be, since day 1 I got reminded day and again ki ‚Äòcivil mein scope kahan?‚Äô. During our first wing sessions, I got to know that Civil Engineering in IITK Lingo translates to ‚Äòberozgari‚Äô. I even remember after one of the tutorials, I went to the prof. and asked him which book should I refer to for the subject to which he asked me my department. I said ‚Äòcivil‚Äô and he coyly said ‚Äúfir to tum ye hi karlo‚Äù suggesting the easier resource. I don‚Äôt know why I took it on my heart, but it traumatized me deeply. It was the final blow which kicked me into the ‚Äòbranch change‚Äô herd race. Contrary to popular beliefs I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a herd race, it‚Äôs a mindset pushed by the ‚Äòbranch racist‚Äô culture that has gone unchecked for a long time. Also one of the reasons why freshmen should take more fundas from final year students than sophomores.",
      "",
      "Second-year is an eye-opener for many sophomores. People come to terms with the fact that their discipline is probably not what they wish to pursue. The fact that I have juniors looking up to me definitely gave me a transient ego boost to the point where I could give fundas on anything ranging from ‚Äòtime-management‚Äô to ‚Äòhow POR‚Äôs can help you get 1Cr package ‚Äô (Another reason why freshmen should take more fundas from final year students than sophomores). Little did I know all that frivolity, all that gaiety would transpire into the darkest phase of my life: The intern season (more like the whole of 3rd year).",
      "Thus began the not-so-sweet summer of 18‚Äô. I could already sense a feeling of hastiness, a trepidation set amongst my batchmates. It was as if the ‚Äòherd race‚Äô had begun all of a sudden, but this time the finish line wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòbranch-change‚Äô, it was the coveted ‚ÄòDay-1‚Äô companies. So after finally striking off civil engineering as the source of income for my future kids, weeks of agony and indecisiveness culminated in me going for the most unique skill that very few people in the campus work on: Coding. Day and night I toiled hard, burning the midnight lamp, coding, preparing; being an avid cricket fan it‚Äôs not a pleasant sight when your browser autocompletes ‚Äòc‚Äô to ‚Äòcodeforces‚Äô and not ‚Äòcricbuzz‚Äô. The D-day approached. As someone rightly said, with great preparation/resume, comes great expectations. And like everyone else, I sat, perched on the edge of my laptop waiting for the shortlist(s), only to be nowhere found on the Day-1 list. No problem, let‚Äôs try for the next day. No result. Days transcended into weeks, no result. By this time my expectations had taken such a hit, that when I finally got selected, it made little to no impact on me. I felt more relief from giving tests and wearing those formals than being happy of getting a chance to intern at a good firm.",
      "",
      "This marked the beginning of my pre-final year. Even after toiling day and night, burning every ounce of effort remaining in me, when I didn‚Äôt get the offer I thought I deserved, I felt devastated. I blamed everything on my branch (which was wrong). So much so I started hating it, berating myself for choosing it. Being a department-heavy year (as most 3rd years are), I struggled big time. Grasping concepts seemed tough, focusing on academics even tougher. All those labs, courses seemed so futile, so in-vain that I started treating them as mere barriers which I had to cross to escape this limbo. I used to so deeply overthink sometimes, that it took someone snapping their fingers at me to get me out of it as if I was staring at a void. There were days where I would stare blankly at the roof of my room, sulking, regretting, crying. People didn‚Äôt help; ‚Äúteri to intern bhi lag gayi, tujhe kya tension!‚Äù. And I couldn‚Äôt agree more, you see that‚Äôs what my face value was; a cheery boy, 9-pointer, an intern in hand, what could possibly be wrong with him? But that‚Äôs what depression is, the more you live in denial the more it engulfs you. It took me my 5th sem SPI (7.6, from 9.6 in 4th sem) to finally come to terms, to accept that something‚Äôs wrong with me.",
      "So with a newfound low, I embarked on the journey that was the 6th semester. ‚ÄúWhat depression? Isn‚Äôt that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out‚Äù? ‚ÄúBoom roasted (literally)‚Äù! SPI just shy of 7.0. I thought moving out of a single room to a double room might help, so I used to casually insert ‚Äúyar merko to double room hi pasand hai, koi exchange karega?‚Äù in between wingie conversations only to feel ashamed as people used to dismiss the idea with ‚Äúdouble room mein kaun hi rahe!‚Äù. I remember just a week before midsems things were so tough, while talking to my parents I casually mentioned I might want to see a psychiatrist. 2 days later my mother was on my doorstep worried sick, and stayed with me throughout the exams. Too ashamed of this, I didn‚Äôt tell my wingies arousing their suspicion on my increased visits to VH (wink wink).",

      "Besides the art of studying a day before and acing(read passing) a test, I have learnt that discussing things with your mates is always a good option. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get through the dark times had my peers not been by me. Even with all my grumbling and whining, they chose to listen without letting me know. And mind you, they need not be your immediate pals; most of my ‚Äòopen ups‚Äô have been with people who are not very close to me. It is this non-judgemental, charitable culture of the people here that sets IITK apart. The warmth and support I got metamorphosed me into a carefree person void of any self-doubt, from the anxious, nervous freshman. Signs of depression are always there, subtle, but they are there,¬† and it is the duty of your close ones to ascertain the cause of your behaviour.",
      "First-year is such a haphazard mess, one hardly gets time to contemplate! At least that‚Äôs what you think until you come into the second year, and then the third and then the next.¬† With such a plethora of activities, clubs, events, competitions, (acads?) going around, one might initially feel overwhelmed. That is why the first year is delineated in such a vivid manner, one automatically gets lured into it. The feeling of hall-spirit is so indelibly ingrained within people, I‚Äôve seen alums return to their halls, after years, chanting their hall anthems. With our pool pulling off the unexpected, and winning Galaxy‚Äô17, shouting our hall anthems in OAT and lecture halls is a memory I will treasure forever. All those night outs when finally reaped results I saw my seniors in almost tears. That is the place this culture holds.",
      "To be quite honest, for any given sem the amount of time I have spent with my wingies has always been proportional to my academic gains. The more time I spent locked away in my room, the worse it got, which is what happened to me in 3rd year. I was fortunate enough to be a Student guide and Academic mentor(which are the only 2 ‚ÄòPORs‚Äô I have). The ‚Äòbaap‚Äô culture is so intrinsic, so inherent at its core that we often underestimate its influence in a freshman‚Äôs life. Having versed in both sides of the coin as a ‚Äòbaccha‚Äô and a ‚Äòbaapu‚Äô, the transition hasn‚Äôt been the smoothest, but I hope I‚Äôve done justice to my part.",

      "From hiding my own fears to having the opportunity to be trusted enough by someone for sharing their own problems with me, it has been an enthralling journey. ‚ÄúDoubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.‚Äù (Suzy kassem). So next time, fill out that damn POR form for the new event position if you want to, even if you are too ‚Äòsenior‚Äô for the role, even if it would affect your academics; go out and support your hall at OAT even if you are an effing‚Äô fraudy and have only contributed in devouring the late-night refreshments of parathas and chai; ask that girl out whom you‚Äôve been crushing about since a long time now and who you think is completely out of your league (but seriously, I would tread lightly); join a club/activity which you didn‚Äôt join till now but want to but are too shy ‚Äúkyunki 2nd/3rd/4th year mein 1st-year vale kaam kaun karta hai yar?‚Äù; work on that dull-witted startup idea that you and your friend conferred over drunken nights under high skies; plan that 5-day trip over the 2-day weekend knowing well before it will get cancelled; talk to your parents when you feel low, go out and burst into your close friends‚Äô room but just GO, don‚Äôt stay! Your stay here is not like a musical symphony where one wrong note nullifies the melody, it‚Äôs more like the HSS lottery process, whichever ‚Äòcourse‚Äô you take you‚Äôll end up learning something new and significant üôÇ My journey is not that of a popular, bright, achieving student, but of a rather average person who found contentment in the tiny pleasures, this campus offers.

      "When I came into the campus, I was determined to be a part of the dramatics club. And I dived in it without thinking it through. I participated in the Freshers‚Äô mime and then Dram Eve 1 and subsequently was also a part of the Antaragni contingent. I enjoyed my time there without the slightest care in the world for my academics. A few of the then 2nd-year seniors told me that ‚ÄúEk hafte me sab padh loge. ESC101 me mera toh bina padhe B aaya tha.‚Äù(trans. ‚ÄúYou would be able to do it all in a week. I got a B in ESC101 without even studying‚Äù). I was presented with alternative views as well but I chose what was convenient for me. And as you can expect, I scored below average marks in all subjects except ESC because there, I scored maybe 10/100. I thought of leaving the contingent after the midsems but I had no friends outside of the club. I was faced with an existential crisis of sorts. I continued with the practice as it also provided me with an escape from my otherwise grim college life. I tried to cope up with my studies but I failed miserably. With an SPI of 4.8 in the first semester (fortunately no Fs), I felt devastated.",
      "",
      "I came back for the second semester, rather low, tried to quit all extracurricular activities because I wasn‚Äôt able to manage things but still ended up doing nukkad natak in Galaxy‚Äô17. Veeras did their first nukkad natak ever and we won the first prize and I still clearly remember that moment. It was probably the happiest I‚Äôd been in that semester (no extra engagements was dull üôÅ ). And I found some good people too, who about a semester later became my very good friends. But before that, in the second semester, my fears came true. I had exactly 1 friend, Smit. I remember being low all the time, trying to study but not being able to. I remember sitting on the bench outside the main auditorium‚Äôs gate with Smit, crying my eyes out after I ruined my first MTH102 quiz, even though I had studied hard. I was always a bright student and was even happy with my JEE rank with no regrets which is uncharacteristic of many people here. But I never cleared exams such as NTSE, KVPY, etc. and when people around me talked about their achievements I felt out of place. I was sure of the fact that I had landed by mistake in college and that I am not good enough. I became more and more insecure and pessimistic. And another semester passed and I wasn‚Äôt any better. 5.7 again.",
      "",
      "Next semester, I was back again to do the same drill but with improvements. I knew I had to take one step at a time. I started with attending classes which I did very little in my first year. I knew I wanted more friends from my hostel. I started to interact with my new neighbours. It wasn‚Äôt as tough as I thought making friends would be, or maybe I was just lucky to find very welcoming people. My CPI improved but only at the cost of an F grade in MSO203b. And I took that one grade pretty hard on myself. I told myself I have to ace it when I do it the next time. I promised myself to get a CPI of 7 before the intern season and 8 before the placements began. I know there are many people reading this who think 8 isn‚Äôt a big deal, but back then, it was for me.",
      "",
      "Before my 3rd year began, there I was with a 7+ CPI and no backlogs. (Also, summer gave me new friends who‚Äôll stay with me forever.) I knew I wanted to do more than academics now. It was time for me to come out of my shell. Come out again. But this time, well prepared. I started by joining the Women‚Äôs Cell, followed by Antaragni‚Äô18. Now I knew I could handle things and still not ruin my academics. But the 5th semester was already over and I had no internship. I wanted a research intern for I was sure I wanted to explore my branch first. I absolutely loathe coding, thanks to ESC101. I knew I stood no chance for the research programs and cold mailing was my only resort. But I still kept an eye on the SPO portal in hope of a good core profile showing up. Mitsubishi was the first company I applied to and thankfully my last as well. By the end of the 6th semester, I had achieved more than what I hoped for. Before the 7th semester, I had my dream 8 CPI too. Having a support system of friends, flunking negligible classes, and being up to date worked well for me. The pressure of having my feet in a lot of things which used to stress me out earlier, turned into this acute awareness of limited time, pushing me to be more efficient. Now, life was in order but there was more I could do. From needy to greedy.",
      "Consequently, I became Head, Media, and Publicity, Antaragni‚Äô19. The festival gave me a lot of skills and experiences that‚Äôll stay with me forever. It gave me an opportunity to interact and work with some lovely juniors and I made a lot of new friends. I enjoyed the process thoroughly and I miss C-124/1 which became my other room. The room would be crammed up with people leaving barely any space to breathe, and we would talk about the most random things, laughing our asses off. And I can never put into words what those 4 days of Antaragni meant to me. But due to some unfortunate events that unfolded, I found myself in a soup with which I had nothing to do. With the SSAC proceedings against me, the struggle against the decisions of the administration was too draining but I had my friends, family, and some professors determined to fight with me, for me.",

      "In these rewarding, hectic, and tumultuous days, I also got rejected thrice from some of my dream companies. I was heartbroken then, but it‚Äôs fine now (or so I tell myself). I came to IITK like a blank slate with many choices in front of me. Some I picked for myself. Some, I crossed out, others the recruiters did.¬† But the 8th semester was the perfect opportunity to unwind. Half of it went so good but we had saved the best for the last. Photoshoots, treats, DE, Dept. farewell, all of it after midsems. Unfortunately, corona had other plans. But that will make us cherish the small moments that we had, even more, I guess.",
      "I think it is very important to realize your capabilities and limitations as an individual. Not everybody can multitask from the very beginning. You have to know what works for you. There is no one blueprint for success. I realized that I was never the last moment student. Being consistent, attending classes was my thing. I had to take things one at a time and then push myself. You should not compare yourself with anyone, as this place can be really ruthless if you do. You‚Äôll always find people better than you in some aspects.",
      "I‚Äôll admit that purely academics did not give me happiness. But it gave me the stability and confidence to enjoy the happy moments with friends and extra curricular, spent otherwise in guilt.",
      "What I found very frustrating about this place is that you are never just a candidate here. You‚Äôre either a male or a female candidate. You might argue that it has some ‚Äúperks‚Äù at times, but in campus life, it isn‚Äôt the same. You always carry your gendered identity in places where it doesn‚Äôt even matter. If you‚Äôre a female, most of your achievements are overshadowed by that one fact. And when it comes to PORs, a certain amount of female participation is felt to be appropriate, even encouraged but anything more than that is too much.",

      "I am really grateful for how my journey has been. I am happy that I could get myself out of that first-year phase. From people greeting me with questions like ‚ÄúAre your studies going fine?‚Äù in the first year to people calling me maggu (I really enjoyed this one), I think I‚Äôve come a long way. I may not have enjoyed every bit of it, but when I see it as one whole picture, I feel it is complete. I‚Äôve had my fair share of bulla sessions, after practice waali MT ke chai pakode, random eat-outs and treats, a random SSAC too, selections, painful rejections but that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be (minus the SSAC of course).",

      "My story starts from the very first day of the orientation, we were standing in a queue inside Hall X on a super-hot day, waiting for our turn to go inside the Hall Office and submit the DD post after which we were supposed to go to the adjacent room to have our very first ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù with seniors. Before I entered the hall office, the Notice Board with 10 photos on it caught my eyes. These 10 were the part of Hall Executive Committee; which obviously I had no idea about. The photo on the top had ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù written beside it and the very next moment I made a commitment to myself that I want my photo up there (too ambitious :P). Going ahead with the schedule, the moment I entered the room, one of them asked me ‚ÄúBaap kaun hai tera?‚Äù. To give you all the context, I was yet to meet my SG. So obviously I was unaware of the lingo and this question was enough to hurt my fragile small ego, hence I answered ‚ÄúRajnikant‚Äù, and that‚Äôs where the trouble began.",
      "When given a choice to go for the Gymkhana week or to stay back in the quads, I opted for the quads. I could have well built a repo with my hall seniors, but my mouth had other plans for me. I went to the Mess Secretary and asked him ‚ÄúHEC Kaise Bante Hain?‚Äù. There was a moment of silence there, he was probably trying to digest what he just heard, and then the news spread like anything. Seniors from all the wings came down to know ‚Äòwho is this guy who wants to be the next president‚Äô. Though it was sarcasm then, they soon witnessed it becoming a reality (:P). The coming weeks were very hard, though it made me emotionally strong, it also made me meet the vulnerable side of mine.",
      "Next were the wing representative (repi) elections; by now you all can guess that I am surely going to try for it, and guess what? 3 people went for it, and out of 35 votes, I got nil, Siddhartha got elected, and from now on till the rest of his stay, he is called ‚ÄòRepi‚Äô. The excitement was not dead yet, in August, I contested for the post of Senator. This time too, my mouth did all the damage ‚Äì because of a statement of mine, the HEC of my hall got fined and out of the 7 who contested, I was the only one not getting elected.",
      "Shortly after Senate elections occurred the HC protests. The incident is still crystal clear in my mind, it was 6 in the morning, we were going for our PE class, and all of a sudden, a person came and started informing us about the protest and requested us to join it. And who doesn‚Äôt want to miss their PE class? We joined the protest; with time we came to know about the issue. I was witnessing the same person who came to call us, leading us almost everywhere, be it the IIT Gate or Chauraha or Academic Area gate. After asking one of my seniors I came to know that he is Ashutosh Ranka, the President of Students‚Äô Gymkhana. Though I was not much aware about the post but the aura and authority of it made me commit to myself that I want this post in time to come. The irony was, I was losing the elections of wing repi and was aiming for the post of President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana. Later, many events took place be it the GC, Festivals or Hall Events. I never missed any opportunity to try exploring something new which this campus had to offer.",

      "Finally, it was that time of the year, the nominations for the HEC were called for. This was the post I was dreaming for the last 1 year, so I made all the efforts to ensure that I am not missing anything, be it being well versed with the functioning of HEC, be it the major issues in the Hall & innovative solutions to it or be it political activities that go behind the curtains in elections. I marked them all. I made the most elaborate manifesto with the motivation to complete each of those points.

Being motivated to accomplish the dream of becoming the PSG I started searching for avenues to get associated with the Gymkhana and to build relations with the seniors. I joined a couple of committees and worked equally hard to get my targets executed. The year felt too smooth to be true.",
      "",
      "As precedent, CoSHA Convener used to be the strongest contender for the post of PSG and there were talks that the eligibility criteria to contest could change and only senators will be allowed to contest for it. So, I had 2 major elections in front of me and both were equally important to reach a step closer to my dream.",
      "Again 7 people contested for the post of the senator and yes, I was the last one in the race. The only satisfying thing which happened was, the eligibility was not changed, so I could still contest for the post of CoSHA Convener. I gave a lame excuse to myself that I never wanted to be a Senator, I contested just because there was a possibility of change in the criteria.",
      "This time I was motivated as hell and was prepared with all my energy for the post. I made the most elaborate manifesto, gathered the views of the previous office bearers, hall presidents, senators, and God knows not whom. But this time again, luck was not on my side, I got defeated again. This loss actually made me hollow from the inside, the excitement was overpowered by sadness and the road from New-SAC to Hall-12 felt non-ending. The best thing that day was that the members of my HEC with whom I never shared such a strong bond before this, were there in the Senate Hall to support me.",
      "The days became gloomy, I stopped attending classes until a meeting one afternoon, which changed everything. I was having my lunch in the mess and the then Head Events of Antaragni came and sat beside me. He said ‚ÄúCoSHA ke baad toh President nahi ho payega na? Antaragni mein try karna hai?‚Äù, that question sounded very surprising to me because I had never worked in any capacity in Antaragni before this, so I was equally unaware of the functioning as a fresher could be. I decided to go out of the shell to witness what‚Äôs going outside. There were rumors that I am finally out of the PSG race, in a sense that was true but it was a tight slap to my dream and I was not able to digest it.

In the summers of my 2ndyear, I was interning in a start-up based out of Kochi. The work which Synchronicity demanded from me was so satisfying and interesting that even during my office hours I used to engage myself with Synchronicity stuff, and I didn‚Äôt realize this becoming a routine until my MD threatened of not approving the PVF if I continue to work this way. Even after coming back to campus, I spent the major chunk of my time in C-Bot. The association and the feel for the festival grew at such an exponential rate, that I was considering dropping the plan for PSG and going for the Core Team next year.",
      "Somewhere between this, on 5thOct an interesting episode took place. It was the first day of Udghosh, I was the Acting President then because Pratyush (the then PSG) was not on campus. The same firm was contacted by Udghosh as well as Antaragni for the sponsorship and I was to make the final decision in the matter.The matter was serious enough that 2 Core Team Members of Antaragni came to my room at 3:00AM to wake me up and convince that I take decision in their favour. As the story became clearer, I tried multiple times to contact Pratyush but I was not able to. Any sane mind with plans of contesting for PSG or to try for the Core Team of Antaragni would have made the obvious choice, isn‚Äôt it? I took the completely opposite decision based on my learnings! Once Pratyush returned back to the campus, even he appreciated the decision after understanding the whole matter.",
      "The Antaragni days were the four most amazing days of that year! We could very well witness the results of our months of hard work in the enjoyment and liveliness with which participants were enjoying the festival. The best moment of those 4 days was when we were on the top of the stage after the final show and hugging each other to show our happiness for what we all as a team had done. That was when one of the Core Team members said ‚ÄúAb bhi President banna hai ki Core Team banega?‚Äù And my very next response was ‚ÄúCore Team!‚Äù.",

To ensure that no stone remains unturned, I gave my best shot to it, my day used to start at 9:00 AM and end at 4:00 AM. I made all the efforts to build relations with people, identify the genuine issues which they have, consulted with alums to understand the best solutions to it, identified the major areas where IITK was lacking in comparison to sister IITs and wrote it all in my manifesto. During this process, several rumors spread across the campus, but that‚Äôs okay, I feel it is an inevitable part of the process.",
      "This part of my campus life is too big to quote it all here, it was filled with multiple emotions and dynamic lifestyles. I made a strong team for myself, those were the people who were standing with me during all the lows and the highs of the process. As the elections were coming closer, each moment was getting as dynamic as it could be. Even a single wrong word could have impacted it all. Finally, the longest battle came to an end with the record voting percentage and I was elected as the President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana!

The rich theory, complex logic, sheer brilliance and the impact which the sector was created in the lives of fellow citizens motivated me to the core to pursue a career in it. I finally started searching for opportunities in the sector and after learning about the kind of work that various firms do, ‚ÄòSamagra | Transforming Governance‚Äô became the dream firm to work with, for me. To understand the sector better I attended the ‚ÄòGood Governance Yatra‚Äô to witness the good work taking place around us. I also invited Mr. Anil Swarup Sir for a talk in the campus to understand his perspective about the domain and career in it.",
      "",
      "Today I feel that in case the elections might not have called off, I could have never realized my interest and motivation to work in this domain. I am finally enjoying each day of life to the fullest, be it hanging out with my favorite set of people i.e. PRANK, be it reading books (this is a newly developed interest of mine), be it writing narrative poems or be it playing cricket.",
      "I have lived my four years to the fullest. There was nothing in these four years which I had postponed to the future. Whatever my biggest desires were, I really did well to fulfill them, whether they got fulfilled or not. But the way I lived my four years were really phenomenal. I experienced everything which I wanted.",
      "FINAL WORDS",
      "IIT Kanpur is a bundle of opportunities, each one among us has a very unique story to narrate, the learnings, the highs, the lows and the trajectory of each one of us is very different and that is the beauty of this campus. Each of those 7500 stories is as ideal as it could be in its own ways. If you will ask me my biggest learnings it‚Äôs surely the act of perseverance of not giving up till the end, being true to my ideologies even if it means the world going against me, building relations because let it be how many superlative terms you are, you always need someone to trust to and come back to and my biggest victory is the transformed perspective about the world.",
      "",
      "Once I went to meet one of the Ex-OPC, there was a quote written on one of his photos which stated ‚ÄúOne day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it‚Äôs worth watching‚Äù, the quote stayed with me. As I close my eyes today to witness the four most magnificent years of my life, the story is actually worth watching. I will just ask you all to go out, do stuff, make the best out of these four years, make memories, even if you fall once don‚Äôt worry, the life will surely give you another opportunity to fly; just don‚Äôt give up, try out everything which is in your limit and make your story worth reliving.",
      "The list of people which made these four years‚Äô worth remembering is too long to quote here, I will like to thank each of them be it the PRANK, Nilay and Vaibhav, my HEC, Antaragni team, Gymkhana team, hall seniors & juniors, my wingies, my elections team and whomsoever I have interacted with during my stay.",

      "Like every semester, this semester also I came home for the mid-semester break. When I was leaving the campus on the evening of 8th March, I had never thought that these holidays were going to be indefinite. I was still looking forward to being back on campus after this lockdown when one day I received a message in my inbox asking me to write an article on ‚ÄòAs We Leave.‚Äô Yes. That moment hit me hard. Till then, I had not realized that the beautiful journey of my post-graduation at IIT Kanpur was going to end. The words can never be enough to summarise the time I had at IIT Kanpur but I thought of giving it a try!",
      "Being born and brought up in Delhi, coming to Kanpur was not something that I was looking forward to. I still remember the night when I had finally confirmed my admission and the thought of going to the hostel after being a daily scholar during my undergrad days at Delhi University didn‚Äôt let me sleep. I was worried about my survival away from home, away from the city I love and away from my friends. At that time, I had no idea that I was going to a place which I would be calling my second home; a home away from home.",
      "",
      "The very first best thing that you get to experience after arriving in this campus is the orientation and in my initial days itself, I had decided that I am going to explore the maximum opportunities in whatever little time that I had at this serene campus. Thus, I did not stop myself from getting involved in as many things as possible and went on to participate in chess competitions, workshops joined Prayas and became a member of the academic senate in my first semester itself.",
      "",
      "On the last night of the orientation days, during the treasure hunt, I met the most amazing set of people who did not let me miss my home and friends for not even a single day. We used to spend the entire night in OAT talking nonsense, singing shit and dancing as if no one is watching. I was actually enjoying my life when the mid-semester exams happened. Being from a non-engineering background, I was finding it a little hard to compete with my classmates who had their undergraduate degree in engineering. I screwed up my first exam. The dream of scoring the perfect 10 started breaking into pieces in front of my eyes. I didn‚Äôt lose hope and ended up scoring one B and rest of As in my mark sheet.",
      "",
      "After the satisfactory first semester, I had already fallen in love with this campus. In December, I had cut short my vacations and came a week earlier to participate in a winter orientation programme organized by Counselling Service. I was thinking that it was the most enriching experience I could have at IIT Kanpur but then the SPO happened! Words can never be enough to describe my feelings and the time that I have spent at the placement office in the Outreach Building. When the nominations for Overall Placement Coordinator came out, I filled the form in the next two minutes because I thought that I was ready to take such a huge responsibility of getting a whole batch placed, alongside my own placements and semester load. I was looking forward to a professional journey ahead and not realizing that it would become my most personal one by the time I would leave this campus!",
      "At SPO, I got the chance to work in a team with the best bunch of people. At the start, I was afraid if I would ever be able to mix up with the people who were already working with the placement office for the last two years. I was a new one and had no idea about how things worked but thanks to my team, they never let me feel like an outsider. They were not only supportive throughout the tenure but they also respected my decisions and opinions at the same time. With time, I developed a bond with them that was not only professional but also an emotional one.",
      "",
      "My next semester passed very quickly. With the help of the best labmates I could ask for, I was managing my thesis work and the placement preparation alongside the work of OPC which was taking up the heat with each passing day as December was approaching. Meeting these people was the only relief and the good thing on an otherwise busy day. I remember when I had screwed up my JP Morgan test and could not sleep for the whole night, they were the people who came by my side to console me and motivated me to let it go and keep looking forward. Every night of November used to come with a new shock and tension of companies backing out but I am glad that it taught me to face the difficult situations with a calm and composed attitude. I had one of the best times of my life while working in the placement office. The fifteen days of placement drive went well with us breaking the previous records and me securing a job offer on Day 1. I thought that it was over. But no, I was wrong. SPO and its people had already become a very integral part of my IIT Kanpur journey.",
      "My life at IIT Kanpur can not be summarised without the mention of the room parties that I used to host at my place. (P.S. Just like Monika from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.) From all the heated discussions to a pleasant musical evening, from enjoying Pizza to organizing a Bhelpuri party, I have had a memorable time at my room spending moments with my friends. And not to forget all the cups of cappuccinos that I had at CCD.",
      "",
      "One thing that IIT Kanpur has made me realize is that we can never appreciate the light if we haven‚Äôt seen the darkness. I have had my share of highs and lows here. There was a time when I felt miserable and worthless and nothing was going right. But that time gave me the strength and the chance to emerge as a stronger and a better person. I might not have got the dream placement but I have got a belief that I have the potential to pursue those dreams. This is what IITK does, it will make you realize that nothing is impossible if we are determined enough to go for it. Life here is not easy but it will make you learn to handle the difficult situations with the utmost ease. Each experience will give you a life lesson that is going to stick with you for the rest of your days. You will meet the most lovely, amazing, intelligent and wonderful people here with whom you are going to have the best time of your life.",
      "",
      "From all the night outs to all the crazy busy days, from the first morning of the semester to the last-minute rush of the end semester exams, from spending nights in the library to sleeping all day in the hostel room, from eating dal chawal in mess to having a sandwich at CCD, I grew up. IIT Kanpur has given me something that is beyond the 9+ CPI on my mark sheet and placement on Day 1. It has made me realize that nothing can stop me from reaching heights if I keep on believing in myself. It has shown me that if managed well, there are so many things that you can do in a short span of time. Most of all, it has given me the memories that I am going to cherish for the rest of my life and the friendship of the people who I know are not going to leave me.",
      "",
      "With the tears in my eyes, I wish to have one more day at this campus where social distancing won‚Äôt be a norm. I belong to that unfortunate batch of graduating students who do not know if there will be any last day on the campus. They will never get farewell and they will never get the department photo-shoots. Had I known that COVID-19 is going to snatch the best time of all the graduating students, I would have done all the things that I was planning to do in the last two months. Had I known this before, I would have enjoyed one more night out, grabbed one more cup of coffee, clicked one more picture in the campus and one more of everything that I had done before. Most importantly, I would have hugged my friends a little tighter before leaving.",
      "I would be leaving IIT Kanpur with the precious moments of all the good and bad times that I had here. For a girl who was thinking of dropping out because of homesickness before joining is taking a part of this place with her as she leaves. She has a corner in her heart that will always belong to IIT Kanpur and the people she met here!",

      "It‚Äôs 7 in the evening of 22nd May 2016. I just came back after having the worst set of 2 papers in my life. I‚Äôm discussing the question papers with my mates, and I realize how badly I had messed up. It was the worst day of my life. Fast forward to the present. As I write this, it‚Äôs 7 in the evening of 22nd May 2020. I already know the decision of my last semester. Still, I‚Äôm waiting for the director‚Äôs mail so that it becomes official. And then the bomb drops. I‚Äôve become an alum.",
      "My college life had just abruptly ended. All those memories flashed through my eyes: the buildings, the incidents, and, most importantly, the people. It was the worst day of my life. Four long years transform a person completely. We often take our stay for granted and only realize its importance once our time is truly over. It was no different for me. But as they say, part of the journey is the destination, and you have to move on to the next chapter. In this piece, I‚Äôll unfold my journey here at IITK, and maybe make you appreciate how precious your time at IITK is. I want to share both the professional and the personal aspects of this journey.",
      "To be honest, Chemical Engineering at IIT Kanpur was never a strong preference. It was just what I was getting with my mediocre rank in JEE. So I came to IIT with a very bleak mindset. I desperately wanted a branch change. I still remember my first day here. As I entered the campus gate, and it felt like I had entered into another world. I did not expect this 1000 acre land to be so different from Kanpur city‚Äôs bland environment. I became a bit happy after driving past all those peacocks, and then I reached this old building called Hall 5. The first person I met here was this person whom we called Baapu. With his spiked hair and gentle voice, he gave me a false sense of security that all the rumors about those ‚Äúsenior-junior interaction‚Äù were actually rumors. The second person I met was this pale-faced guy who was my roommate, who later went on to become one of the closest friends I have at IITK. The reality of senior-junior interaction kicked in only on my first GBM. The executives of Hall 5 locked the door and gave us Samosa and a glass of Coca-Cola. For a short-lived moment, I believed that none of the rumors were true. When I had just taken the first sip, the then president of hall 5 screamed at the top of his lungs, roaring the widespread cuss words. I was horrified and wasn‚Äôt able to gulp down the cold drink I had in my mouth. This was when I realized that all of it was very true.",
      "This being the first time I was living away from family, I was having a hard time adjusting to this new environment. Thanks to my wingies, and some great friends I made in the first year, I got used to the place in no time. The scavenger hunt, the outings, and the night outs are the best ways to make this place your home during the first year.",
      "Now, how did my goals turn out? I managed to stay away from most of the campus activities, apart from this event called E-Summit, where I volunteered because of peer pressure. I did participate in the galaxy parade in which one of the HECs had to chase me on the bicycle because I kept running away from GBMs. I got a 7.6 in each of my first and second semesters. Coincidently, that is my current CPI as well. So as one could already guess, branch change was a complete disaster. I made peace with the fact that I was going to stay in chemical engineering. In the summers, I stayed back and did a course and a departmental project.",
      "I was now well adjusted with life at IITK and had made good friends. But I did pay the price for it. My grades! It was time to find a new goal and get my act together. So I took an interest in the chemical courses and continued with my project. Things started getting back on track on these fronts. I was open to getting involved somewhere on the campus. Because of my previous experience at E-Cell as well as good word of mouth for it, it was a natural choice for me. The Overall Coordinators of my time had a lasting impression on me. I learned the importance of having a good intern and that firms look for an all-round personality in the candidates. I had made up my mind that I wanted to be the next Overall Coordinator of E-Cell and also improve my academics. So I worked at E-Cell all around my second year.",
      "The best experience I had was the E-Cell interviews. My interview lasted for 6 hours, and the seniors who seemed like angels brought out with their devilish sides. During those 6 hours, I learned more about E-Cell and entrepreneurship than the previous 2 years combined. And in the end, I became the Overall Coordinator, along with my long time friend. Perhaps he was the only one with whom I could have pulled off a great tenure.",
      "",
      "Halfway into the journey, I was happy. Everything was going according to plan. I became the OC, improved my grades to some extent, and was sincerely doing my project. I felt a step closer to getting my dream intern at ITC or HUL. On the personal front, I was also spending a lot of time with my close friends. What else could anyone ask for? Little did I know that things were going to get pretty bad for me really soon.",
      "When the summers of 2018 ended, a series of storms was ahead of me. Only half of the work was done for E-Summit, which was only a month away. Day 1 intern interviews were a week away. There was so much to do in so less time. During the intern, I nailed the Group Discussions quite well. I was shortlisted for the interview for both the companies. However, I didn‚Äôt make it past the interviews. In one of them, I made it till the very last, but my lower CPI came out to be the reason for getting rejected. I was devastated.",
      "On 22nd August, just 4 days before E-Summit and my birthday as well, I got my internship at Dr. Reddy‚Äôs. I was happy because I had finally landed an internship. The remaining work for E-Summit also wrapped up and those three days were the most happening days of my college life.",
      "",
      "However, due to the workload I had in these 2 semesters, I grew apart from my friends. I screwed up my CPI (again). I got an X grade in the departmental communication course! After Gymkhana Day that year, reality hit me as I realized the third year was pretty harsh for me. I learned about this career option called Management Consulting, which attracts the best profiles. I never thought that I could make it because of my CPI and my mediocre profile. So, I aimed for a mediocre firm during the placement.",
      "My intern was in the city of Vishakhapatnam, where there weren‚Äôt a lot of people to have fun with. The work site was 2 hours away from the guesthouse, so I spent 4 hours daily commuting on a bus. When I came back to my guesthouse, I prepared for GMAT. I had my fair share of fun though, when some of my friends came over.",
      "Then, after my internship, things started getting better. I resolved the gap with my friends. I applied for McKinsey, BCG, and Bain with no expectations. I had an entire semester to focus on my career while most of my friends were busy building their own careers or were simply not on campus. I started practicing cases sincerely. Two seniors, one who was PSG and got placed in BCG and another, a close friend from E-Cell, who got placed in Bain, helped me a lot during the preparation. It was during this time that I realized how essential seniors are in one‚Äôs campus journey. The things that we heard in the first year truly started to make sense.",
      "On 5th October 2019, I finally achieved what I longed for. I got an offer from Bain & Company. I got the professional success I had wanted all through my campus life. A few days later, I got an offer for a deferred MBA from the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, which I eventually rejected.",
      "After that, I just enjoyed the remaining time of the semester with a newfound group of friends that we refer to as PRANK (Parth-Rahul-Abhishek-Navneet-Krishna). In the short-lived yet fantastic last semester, I reconnected with all my friends and had the most amazing times. Night-outs, outings, dinners, parties, drinks, and some gymming filled my days. In the first week of March 2020, I even went on a trip to the Himalayas with my wingies. When we climbed down the mountains, we realized that we would be heading home and not back to the campus to finish the final chapter.",
      "",
      "The journey had its ups and downs, but more than the place, it was the people that made the journey what it is. I‚Äôd mention 3 people who were important to me in this journey. The first is my roommate, Anshul Yadav, who has always been my go-to person whenever I was caught in any trouble. The second is my IITK Bhai, Nikhil Srivastava, who has been the person who made my life fun and understood me. The last and the most important person is my best friend Shruti Jain, who has been there in the thick and thin and seen my journey. She‚Äôs the person who has always brought out the best in me. With these people, I feel that my time is not yet over, and there‚Äôs still a long way to go.",
      "",
      "This was my bitter-sweet journey in IIT Kanpur. I wouldn‚Äôt have the entire stay any other way. I often feel that if there had been a better closure to campus life, the journey would have felt more complete. But this is how this experience is. It follows you when you need it the most and vanishes when you are ready to move on to the next phase of your life. With the entire cycle complete, I wish all the junior batches that they enjoy their time and make their best memories here at IIT Kanpur!",

      "Gaurav Rawat is a final year undergraduate in the Chemical Engineering department. Let‚Äôs have a look at his journey at IIT Kanpur and live the nostalgia and reminiscence with him.",
      "Disclaimer:-¬†The views presented below are the author‚Äôs own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general. This is an informal account of the author‚Äôs experiences at IIT K.",
      "",
      "There are so many things I wish someone had told me at the beginning of my journey here so that I‚Äôd be less worried and more confident in my stay here.",
      "",
      "A letter to the 4 years younger me.",
      "",
      "Hey Gaurav, what‚Äôs up? I know you‚Äôre excited and scared now that you‚Äôre finally here; take a breath and trust me when I tell you it‚Äôs going to be okay. Your stay at IIT Kanpur is going to be nothing short of extraordinary, and you will cherish it. One of the most important things I‚Äôd like to tell you is that it is absolutely alright to feel a bit overwhelmed, and yes, you will find yourself with the nagging feeling that you are no longer the best at anything anymore.",
      "The greatest thing that has happened- and what you must remember- is that JEE is now over. You‚Äôre no longer in a race with lakhs of students for one seat. Your only and most important competitor is you. This is you trying to make YOUR life, a life that you have worked for 2 years non-stop to achieve. Try creating your own beliefs and opinions about everything rather than blindly believing anyone you interact with. This will be an entirely different lifestyle, and I hope that you explore and extract as much as you can from this place by the time you graduate.",
      "The academics here work differently, so be wary of that. It is okay to falter, to not score enough, or as much you would have preferred. But don‚Äôt let the comparisons make you feel any less about yourself. Embrace the challenge and push yourself harder with every failure you get. I know it‚Äôs much easier to say so in hindsight, but it honestly doesn‚Äôt get more accurate. I got my best SPI in the semester, which was the most loaded one. Eventually, you will learn to manage your time well, and actually turn out to be quite efficient.",
      "",
      "I‚Äôm so proud of you for choosing to go out and explore hobbies and clubs and finding a life beyond academia. You will soon find yourself in a new family- your basketball family, which will embrace you with open arms. You will find that the time and effort that you put in will be more than worth it, and you will discover that you‚Äôre a better student and a better person because of it. You will obviously need to be a bit more efficient and disciplined to be able to manage your academics alongside, but this will be something that is uniquely yours. It will help you hold on to reality and keep you grounded. The experience of playing in Inter-IIT, competing at the highest level, winning a few games and closely competing others, taking and sharing the responsibility of the team and its future, will teach you wonders. Some losses might even take forever to get over. These things cannot be taught elsewhere. The bonds you form with your teammates, your seniors, and those who follow you are irreplaceable.",
      "Speaking of bonds, in addition to friends, there will be crushes, first-loves, and relationships. With it, there will then be frustrations, heartbreaks, and unprofessed feelings. Over time, I have understood that being open about your emotions, first to your own self, then to the person of your affection, is both healthy and liberating. Being vulnerable is not a flaw as long as you are courteous and respectful of the other person. Not everyone would be walking out of college with the love of their lives. Still, I assure you, the experience will bring growth and a new perspective on emotional maturity.",
      "",
      "As you finish your first year, there will be some confusion about what to do in the summers. Probably for the first time you‚Äôll have the option to do absolutely anything. Having gone on a set path on what to do and study until now, it‚Äôs alright to feel clueless and even slightly worried. This feeling might surface several times in your life. If it makes you feel any better, there was hardly any time when I was entirely sure whether my decision was correct. But here I am, doing quite fine. There would be several days spent entirely unproductive, some of which might even be around your examination days. While some people manage to use exams to motivate themselves, things can sometimes get stressful if you start panicking. Stop being too harsh on yourself. Instead, start focusing on what is left and don‚Äôt allow the guilt of the previous day get to you. This might seem to be an easy way out. Still, it‚Äôs a lot better than spiraling down that vicious cycle of trepidation and eventually not doing anything at all.",
      "You may have trouble trying to figure out whether you wish to go core or non-core. Despite being an unpopular opinion, it‚Äôs perfectly fine if you just want to go ahead in your own branch. What better than actually putting some use to what you have been studying all these years? In any case, it‚Äôs mostly a good idea to figure this out a few months before you sit for your third year‚Äôs internship placements. A clear goal would help you focus your energy at the right place, and possibly use your previous vacations for an intern/project. Following that would be your first interviews. Make sure you prepare thoroughly, and having someone to revise alongside might not be a bad idea. You would realize how many placements depend on sheer luck, and you might even face a few rejections. Things might seem very bleak as the days pass, but have faith in yourself a bit more. Not saying just faith alone will land you your intern, but it will keep that fire inside you alive, and you‚Äôll keep going. There might even be times when you‚Äôd wait all night for your interview to finally get rejected at 4 in the morning. Times like these would be hard to make sense of, and sadly, this isn‚Äôt the only time you‚Äôll feel so. Life isn‚Äôt always fair. Sometimes you may have to face the brunt of someone else‚Äôs actions. Circumstances may even snatch away last month of your college you were so looking forward to. But, you‚Äôll eventually learn to accept those as parts of your life.",
      "",
      "",
      "Do explore all the different responsibilities the campus has to offer, right from your HEC to Gymkhana to the various fests. One of the places where you‚Äôll soon realize that you‚Äôd personally love to be a part of is the Counselling Service. If you ever feel so about any post in general, then do pursue it with no hesitation, but be aware of how you‚Äôre handling everything. CS, along with basketball and academics, would push you to the limit. At the same time, do make sure you‚Äôre not doing any injustice to responsibilities you‚Äôve taken up. The work you do might not be the most glamorous. Sometimes you won‚Äôt get sufficient credit for your hard work. But, in the long run, trust me, your satisfaction will be such that you won‚Äôt feel the need for validation. You‚Äôll be proud of the effort you put in and the impact you made.",
      "",
      "",
      "There might be times when you do feel you have it all. A modest CPI, a good intern, a credible member of the institute team, a lasting relationship, and an obligation-free life heading into your final year. However, important relationships might break up. It will be a tough phase, especially because you were entirely invested in the relationship. Even without judging if it was terrible or great, if you do happen to reach a stage where you just can‚Äôt figure anything out, have faith that it‚Äôll be better ahead. You might not have given much attention to it earlier, but dude your mental health matters. It‚Äôs okay to feel lost for a bit, but know that you have plenty of support. Talking and writing about it definitely helps a lot. You might think that maybe the other person isn‚Äôt interested or doesn‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôre feeling. Even then, it‚Äôs okay to be absolutely shameless while expressing your thoughts truthfully, because the more you do, the better you‚Äôll feel. Your aim here isn‚Äôt to impress anyone, this is the time you take for yourself.",
      "Despite everything, it is imperative that as you come out, you have no regrets. Spend as much time as you can with your friends, because once you‚Äôre out, you‚Äôre going to miss them a lot. Don‚Äôt forget to live your life. College is not just a stepping stone. All this will end way before you can even pause to realize how much has gone by. Whatever issues or challenges you face, just know that your former self is right here. Content and satisfied, having gone through all of them, however long and hard it might‚Äôve been. This might actually be the way forward for the current me as well, as not always will I have a letter guiding me on what to feel. Stay true to your ideals, and things will work out.",
      "My journey personally has been exactly like a roller coaster, taking me to unimaginable heights, only to crash rock bottom just after. Still, as the ride ends, I sit back at my home, where it all started, albeit being much more refined. After all, what doesn‚Äôt kill you only makes you stronger, aye?",

      "As I begin collecting my thoughts, I realize that I‚Äôm looking at four years of my life at IITK with hindsight. Many might not know, but my stay as a student at IITK has been a little extra special. Because my father is a professor here, I‚Äôve lived all my life inside the campus. Even then, I‚Äôve tried making the most of these four years at IITK, without letting the perks of having my home close by devoid me of the numerouscollege experiencesthat one is blessed with.",
      "As I walked into the premises of Hall 10, which was an undergraduate-hall back in the day, I was unaware of what I expected from myself and from IITK in the upcoming four years. ‚ÄúI want to be a drummer‚Äù. A 17-year-old Dhruv knew vaguely what he wanted in life. These were simply words, they lacked focus and foresight. I was an easy going teenager. So what was I doing in an IIT, you‚Äôd ask? Let‚Äôs just say that my parents and I were at a common agreement; I would complete an undergraduate degree before I set out to follow my dreams. It made sense to me, provided performing arts are not just unpredictable, but in some way, unorthodox and rather difficult career choices. My parents and even I, knew it was too early to commit to the dream. Before I go further, I want to present the reader with a short disclaimer: one might find my views a little crazy. After a lot of thought, I have decided to write this article as an informal epilogue, keeping thefundeto the minimum.",
      "",
      "As excited as I was to enter the huge lecture halls as a student now, I slowly started losing pace in a few classes. ‚ÄúProgramming and math aren‚Äôt for me‚Äù, I told myself. Fast forward, and after eight semesters, a ton of courses have found a place in the list alongside programming and math. And not because I was failing or getting bad grades. Grades weren‚Äôt an issue, even though I‚Äôm genuinely weak at the subjects. I could keep up with the exam-week, and I was sincere on my part in attending classes. What really bugged me was my lack of academic inquisitiveness. A lot of my friends had it, why didn‚Äôt I? I was never reallyintoany course, and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people relate, for their own reasons. I must admit that my sole driving force was wanting to excel in my grades, and not my interest in the subject itself (barring a handful of courses I loved). Now that I‚Äôm graduating, I have a little guilt that I probably did not do justice to the engineering curriculum. We all have our idiosyncrasies, and I definitely had mine. I guess itisfine, as long as you‚Äôre ethical and clear about your expectations from yourself.",
      "",
      "",
      "Right from the beginning, the Music Club became and has since been a big part of my identity as an IITK student. My orientation days were met with severe jaundice. I missed out on a lot of activities. A week before my batch‚Äôs Freshers‚Äô, I had recovered enough to be able to visit the Music Club. I was a decent drummer, so I got in. And because of the yellowish tinge to my skin and a complementing yellow shirt, I was nicknamed ‚ÄúPeelu‚Äùalmost instantly by my fourth year seniors. Saying goodbye to the Y13 club seniors was difficult, and I still miss them. I‚Äôve been a part of all the club events so far, and I distinctly remember the skills I‚Äôve learnt as a musician from every song individually that I‚Äôve played in. My tenure as the club coordinator in my third year is something I‚Äôm very proud of, and it posed a lot of challenges. It was fun, but at times the stress got the better of my health. I am very grateful to a few friends who helped me walk through the lows. I grew fonder of music and my desire to improve found a new direction. All the cultural festivals I‚Äôve witnessed; the Antaragnis, the Mood Indigos, the Inter IITs and the Galaxys; inspired me and gave me a chance to interact with people who‚Äôre not only passionate about but are extremely proficient in their art. More importantly, it inculcated in me a sense of respect for other arts. I got the opportunity to be a part of the badminton team till the middle of my third semester. I saw and felt what teamwork is capable of. Oddly, the lessons I learned on the court helped me with my musical endeavors alongside. Playing in a band resonates with playing in a team.",
      "",
      "It is worthwhile to mention the times when I was at a complete loss. Neither did academics appeal to me, nor was I able to find a focused interest in drumming. I was sure that I would not want to work a corporate job. Despite my reclining academic interest, I hadn‚Äôt completely ruled out research, which I would attribute to peer pressure. I tried taking up a few research projects. While I was happy that I was keeping myself busy like my friends were, I was never satisfied with myself; it just didn‚Äôt feel right. A turning point was the third year summer. I secured a research internship under an exchange program at TAMU, Texas. My immigration documents got extensively delayed and when I finally went to the embassy, my visa was sent in for administrative processing, a procedure requiring weeks. While nearly everybody I knew were busy interning, I was still waiting in hopes to hear back. Which I never did. It was depressing, to say the least. Every night I would go to sleep thinking ‚Äúwhyme‚Äù. I slowly lost all hope of my trip. Everyone was working an intern, and I thought I had failed at something I was obligated to do. Drumming was keeping me very busy those days. I had quite a lot of time for myself, and for the first time ever, I had a genuine realization that drumming was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.",
      "",
      "",
      "Now that I had my mind made up, I decided that I would dedicate the final year towards improving at the drums and getting into a good music school. For the first time, I stopped comparing myself to others. I hadn‚Äôt appeared for the intern season, and now I decided not to sit for the placements either. I received a lot of criticism for this decision, but looking back, I am proud that I stood up to it. I got accepted into Musicians Institute (MI), a world-renowned music school for contemporary music in Hollywood, LA. I have also been working on making an Instagram presence through my content, and the efforts are slowly fetching me the desired results.",
      "",
      "IITK was a good decision, and I‚Äôm definitely going to miss the people and the place. It taught me to be humble and respectful towards others and their passions. The bad experiences and the achievements, parting ways with good friends and the numerous heartbreaks; what an emotional ride as well, it‚Äôs been. If there truly were anyfundeI were to give; be sincere in everything you do, be good to people, respect what they do, and don‚Äôt be scared to pursue what you love. Everyone has their dream job, and your stay at IITK will definitely contribute to it in some way. Things might not be easy, but my experiences here have made me believe that everythingdoeshappen for a reason. Respect your friends who are there for you, because they are your biggest source of motivation. Your actions always speak louder than your words, and if you‚Äôre content with whatever you‚Äôre chasing, it‚Äôll show.",
      "Goodbye, IITK. If I ever make it as a successful drummer, I sincerely hope to be able to come back to perform for a show here. Becausethatis what I have always, genuinely yearned for, watching pro-nights throughout my stay in the campus.",

      "Vox Populi brings you the fifth edition of the series Unorthodox Career Choices. We interview people who have taken the leap of faith and bring their stories to you. This edition brings you the story of Arvind Gupta, an alumnus who graduated from the 1975 batch. He is a Toy inventor, a Teacher and a Padma Shree awardee. He was an engineer at TELCO, who left his job to teach science to children from tribal villages. He developed many useful low-cost toys from trash. The possibilities of using ordinary things for doing science and recycling modern junk into joyous products appealed immensely to children. Check out some excerpts from our conversation with Arvind.",
      "‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì",
      "Tell us about your story. How and when did you decide that this is what you really want to do? How did you get interested in the art of toy-making? Who are the people that inspired you in the beginning? And what was your motivation?",
      "I did B.Tech in Electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur (1970-75). Those were turbulent political days. In 1968 students of Paris were out on the streets challenging authority. The Naxal and the JP movements were in full swing in India. Whenever there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of social energy. For instance, during the National Movements, thousands of professionals chucked their jobs and joined Gandhiji. In IIT Kanpur a bunch of students formed SAHYOG ‚Äì an organisation to help teach the children of the mess servants. For 5 years I taught at the Opportunity School. The nicest thing about IIT Kanpur was the exposure to a wide range of cultural activities and extramural lectures. In 1972 Prof. Anil Sadgopal, a Ph.D. from Caltech had left his job in the TIFR and started a science teaching program for village children in Madhya Pradesh. In his talk, he mentioned that we all have a very romantic image of village India ‚Äì green fields,gaon ka panghta,etc. But once you go to a village, problems of class, caste and gender hit you squarely in the face. This quizzed me. Many people in my time wanted to do something meaningful ‚Äì something which would help our people. This was the defining political slogan of those days ‚Äì ‚ÄúGo to the people, live with them, love them, start from what they know, build on what they have.‚Äù",
      "",
      "Considering that you had a secure and prosperous career ahead at TELCO, how did you cross the mental threshold of giving it all up and joining an underpaying village school program? How did your family react to this?",
      "In 1975 I got a job in TELCO (Tata Motors) as a GET. The two-year training on the shop floor was amazing. But after the regular placement, the job became boring. So in 1978, I took a year‚Äôs leave from my job and worked with the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Program (HSTP) and with the famous architect Laurie Baker. The HSTP was a pioneering program started by Dr. Anil Sadgopal to make science fun for village children by designing low-cost, affordable teaching aids using local materials. In the very first month, I designed the Matchstick Mecanno ‚Äì which uses bits of cycle valve tubes as joints and matchsticks to build structures. I loved that kind of work as it would help many children. Later my first bookMatchstick Models & Other Science Experimentswas translated and published in 12 Indian languages and also in Chinese.",
      "My parents had never seen the inside of a school. So, they didn‚Äôt have any great expectations from me ‚Äì¬† getting a multi-national job or going to the USA. I was very lucky to be free from family pressures. I could chart my own journey. In 1980, when I finally quit TELCO, my mother said to me, ‚ÄúGood, that you left the job. Now you will do something meaningful.‚Äù",
      "",
      "Tell us about your days at IIT Kanpur. How did those four years influence your outlook? What role did IITK play in your unconventional career choice?Back then there was a 5 year BTech program with a strong emphasis on Social Sciences. My AIR was 218. So I got Electrical Engineering, which had all the toppers. I learned so much from my clever peers. We had some great teachers ‚Äì Prof. CNR Rao, Prof. D. Balasubramanian. We had an amazing English teacher, Mrs. Suzie Tharu. I did a lot of tinkering with my friend Akhilesh Agarwal. We made aero-models, a compressed air engine, a go-kart, and a See-saw for the Opportunity School. In 5 years we saw every good film by Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray, Bergman Ritwik Ghatak and Fellini, heard Begum Akhtar and Pandit Ravi Shankar alive. The hallmark of a great institute is that it slowly shapes and tones your sensibilities. Without telling you it gets under your skin. For someone coming from a small town of Bareilly in UP, IIT Kanpur opened up an entirely new world. It opened up my mind to amazing possibilities.",

      "You have published quite a few books, have a well-established YouTube channel and also, an active site. Do you have a team working with you? How do you manage all this?I spent 14 years in New Delhi. For the first six years, I taught in a small school run by the Aurobindo Ashram called Mirambika. In 2003 we shifted back to Pune. I was invited to work in the children‚Äôs science center of IUCAA (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy & Astrophysics) by Prof. Jayant Narlikar. We were a team of 3 highly motivated people. Every day we made a short 2-minute video on ‚ÄúToys from Trash‚Äù. Today we have 8700 videos on Youtube with a viewership of over a 100-million. We scanned over ten thousand books on education, environment, science, math, children‚Äôs books, etc and put them on the web. Every day 12 to 15 thousand books are downloaded from my website. It just shows the hunger for good books in our people. Across the world, any creative and useful work is usually done by small focussed and dedicated teams. I was singularly lucky to be a part of such a team.",

Do you have a family that is financially dependent on you?Many schools that invited me to do a workshop paid me some honorarium. I never had a fee. I accepted whatever was offered. Some schools that needed me the most could not pay, but that was fine with me. I never sold anything.¬† I designed to help the poor. All my work is free for all.Inspired by Gandhi, I live a simple life with few needs. Often people talk about Life Insurance. I jokingly talk about Wife Insurance!

What kind of social impact have you been able to make so far?I have been privileged to work in some very poor schools both in cities and far-flung villages. First I show children a few toys. They are made of old plastic bottles, newspaper caps, pumps which can inflate a balloon or throw water 15-feet away, or a simple electric motor. After seeing these toys I can see a twinkle in their eyes, a smile on their faces. There is great hope for our children. In their eyes lies our future dreams.

We have over 300 videos in Spanish. They have been viewed by millions across 26 countries that speak Spanish.The educational terrain in our country is very barren. It is rocky and full of stones.

There has been a shift from chalk and talk to ‚Äúproject-based‚Äù methods and ‚Äúactivity-based‚Äù learning. Now there are few thousand Atal Tinkering Labs. This is a welcome shift.Our educational system is inherently based on inequality. Depending on your position in society, your economic class, you have different schools. International schools with IB for the super-elite. Kendriya Vidyalayas for the organized central government employees. Navodaya Vidyalayas for the emerging rural elite. Some excellent private schools for the rich. The middle class has no stake in government schools anymore. They have long lost trust in them. The poor have no choice but to send their children to government and municipal schools ‚Äì which are in poor shape. In recent years the Delhi government has shown a practical way to improve our government schools. All states must learn from it.There is a tremendous scarcity of good educational material on the internet in our regional languages. There is a plethora of good material in English, but very little in our vernacular languages. We must translate the best resources in the world into our regional languages.

      "I fondly remember an incident of me watching some Y18 peeps become club coordinators/heads and thinking to myself- ‚ÄúWait, what?? These were the same kids asking us whether to fill their admission form with a blue or black pen sometime back.‚Äù Time literally flies away. I was told by seniors here in my first year that these 4 years of college are something I‚Äôll remember for a lifetime (even those seniors who had barely completed 1 year here :p). It seemed quite clich√© to me then. Apparently, everything about loss and separation is a clich√© until you are in it. And here I am writing my memoir for this journey that looks to be almost over.",
      "Honestly speaking, I always thought my story would be a bit too boring for the readers for it being all about my academic involvement. I started off as a textbook good boy. I would complete all assignments and ask doubts in the tutorial session. I would try my level best to be extremely humble and, at times, over-friendly to whoever I met. One can form an image by the fact that I didn‚Äôt miss more than 5 lectures in all in my first semester. MTH101, which haunted most of the batch, was the love of my life and my first A*. Library provided me peace and solace, and I would adore sitting there for hours.",
      "",
      "An interesting consequence of having the protocols set in your mind is you experiment too little. You can be extremely productive in what you are pursuing but, at the same time, may be closing off some avenues without even giving a try. I inferred something similar from discussions with my wingies and bapu. What followed next was me going to almost every session for which I received a mail. I can recall my first and last ELS JAM session where the final scoreline read something like ‚Äì (63, 42, 31, 1). I was 1. Amusingly, I got that 1 grace point just because the jury showed some mercy and asked me to start in the middle :p. I decided I need to plan better. Later, Vox nominations came out, and due to my profound interest in literature, movies, and writing, I joined Vox and remained there for the next 3 semesters.",
      "When the dynamics slowly got settled came the 4th semester and the wind of internships. Before the trauma of preparation, the internship season brings you the trauma of finding your so-called ‚Äòinterest.‚Äô I was treading fairly well in batti courses, but I knew that could clearly be attributed to my love for algebra, prob-stats, and mathematics, in general. At one point, I was seriously considering a branch change to MTH dept, but could never gather courage nor reasoning to explain myself, forget sharing with others. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt find EE dull as well in the first place.",
      "At around the same time, two noteworthy conversations cleared a lot of fog for me. One was with a Y14 going for Ph.D. in communications (a field in EE) and another with an experienced HSS prof I was meeting those days. My question was the same ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen and how did you decide that this is what you wanted to do in your life?‚Äù The former said he didn‚Äôt consciously choose this. It was just a matter of chance that he stuck with a communications prof during a 2nd-year project, and the rest was more of going with the flow. The latter had a much precise answer- ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt finalized yet. I am still in the transition phase.‚Äù",
      "Some important realizations seeped in. No matter how many good or bad choices we have made to this day, we all still have interests and disinterests, likes and dislikes, preferences for the journey ahead. So, any single decision is not going to determine the rest of our lives, and we will have an opportunity to modify it any moment we want to. Moreover, there is no perfect choice. It is about personal acceptance. With me having tried only a small number from an infinite number of avenues on this planet, I may as well have already missed the best path for me long back, but does that make me sad today?",
      "",
      "Despite good grades in most courses, I decided to altogether ditch batti core in internships and future research plans. Now when I think of it, I believe it was a somewhat impulsive call, fueled by my miserable experience in a 2nd year EE project. But do I regret it? No, I don‚Äôt. I was fortunate enough to get an internship in quants. Luckily, despite having mixed days in my internship, the application of quant in industry aligned with my fascination and seemed to be a possible shore for going with the flow.",
      "The 5th semester witnessed another incident of extreme significance for me. It was the Orientation 18 Hall 13 reporting day. It was my first and foremost attempt to manage something substantial, and God, it was a total mess! All I can recollect is chaos, disorder, and troubled parents running around the entire Hall 13. We all have let ourselves down some time or the other, but letting down those 2400 people in front of you was a pathetic feeling. Having not slept for a long time and being constantly yelled at by every single person in the arena on your first big project isn‚Äôt a particularly encouraging sight to behold. I do have an explanation for that collapse, but justification- I neither have nor do I intend to search for. Looking back, from a personal perspective, I am thankful it happened. Having seen that mayhem has made me much more fearless and self-confident. I read somewhere that we never get over failures; we absorb them, and they carve us into different, often kinder, creatures.",
      "",
      "I could never end this piece without mentioning my obsession with grades and accomplishments. Just like most of the readers, I had huge expectations from myself coming in here. While this does bring in competitiveness and desire to get better, a package of moments of enormous stress and anxiety comes together with it. 4 years is a long time, and I don‚Äôt think anyone really goes untouched with this feeling of self-doubt and loneliness. I am incredibly thankful to the student community for discussing such issues in the open and standing strong with each other at tough times, keeping aside several disagreements we may have had internally. It is hard to explain the amount of mental support I received, especially during the days of placements.",
      "An inseparable segment of my journey here was my time in Counselling Service. I am immensely grateful to CS for exposing to me to a concealed reality of the lives of people answering much more complicated questions than just career, grades, and extra-currics; for sensitizing me towards the concerns of a supposedly invisible community around us and above all, for a quite selfish reason of giving me some of the most lovable people in the campus as my best friends. I hope we take all the love and criticism we receive both positively and effectively and get more influential in the coming times to deal with mental health issues on campus.",
      "Finally, as I am so close to leaving a place which has been my home for the last 4 years, I must say there is a massive surge of emotions. I am developing a strong feeling that the time we spend here is probably the time when we undermine the charm of this place the most. This imperfect place slowly transforms us all for sure; classifying it as favorable or not is a personal choice to make. We all come here to achieve big, and this place adorns us with so much more happiness. There is a subtle difference between the two, in my experience.¬† What many of us are aspiring for, typical examples being a high paying job, good research projects, reputed grad schools, administrative services, grades, etc. are simply accomplishments, not happiness. Achievements do build self-worth and are incredibly critical for growth, no denying that, but they may not always translate to long-lasting happiness.",
      "",
      "Happiness is something much more bizarre. It is sleeping peacefully in those small cramped rooms that once seemed ghastly. It is lying down in that one wingies‚Äô room the whole day despite any motive. It is going together to mess, canteen, lecture hall, ShopC, OAT, chowpaty, library, HC, and where not? It is making fun of that one person in the group for no reason at all. It is venting out 2 hours straight to your behen/bhai after your first big rejection or heartbreak. It is getting a tight compassionate hug from your squad after getting your first internship. It is walking down the comforting campus lanes the whole night, discussing the purpose of life. It is laughing hard with your squad remembering the crazy shit you all did 1 year back. It is sharing those intimate details of life which you didn‚Äôt even share with your parents. It is seeing each other grow and mature with time. It is planning to stay in touch and have regular reunions as you are graduating, despite knowing it won‚Äôt actually be possible. It is having a big smile on your face even from the thought of meeting that campus and those few people again after lockdown. That, my friend, is the true pinch of happiness in our lives.",

      "My story probably starts similarly to a lot of kids who come to IIT Kanpur. Till 12th grade, I had been high-achieving; while I put in some amount of baseline effort, I mostly coasted through because the subject matter was interesting, and therefore, easy to me. I was a nerdy kid who would find herself spending hours on Wikipedia reading about synapses and neurotransmitters, about the Vietnam War, about limits of functions, just because. At every parent-teacher meet in school, my mother would complain to the teachers that I never really studied at home, and the teachers would, to her chagrin, always tell her to take a step back and let me be because I was getting good grades and was a great student otherwise.",
      "I wanted to go to IIT because my older brother had gotten through, and expectations were high from me. Since the counselling system was mostly rank-based, and I was a young kid who didn‚Äôt make very good life-altering decisions, (I had originally wanted to go into the math department but was convinced that CS was ‚Äòbetter in terms of job prospects‚Äô) I ended up in the CSE department, enrolled for a dual degree (in the era when they existed) and started my life at IIT Kanpur, with dreams, hopes, and ambition.",
      "This is where my story diverges from some. Starting from the first semester itself, I struggled with the ‚ÄòIntro to Programming‚Äô course. I couldn‚Äôt think in algorithms, or when I did, couldn‚Äôt translate that into code properly. Recursion eluded and frustrated me. I wasn‚Äôt used to this feeling; I didn‚Äôt understand it. I was trying, but everything was difficult and I would get frustrated and want to learn even less, thus forming a vicious loop. As I progressed through the semesters, the subject matter got even more difficult and I was progressively slacking. I started dreading going to classes because I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on, or understand anything. I started skipping a lot of them. There were still a few courses I really enjoyed and I applied myself and managed to get good grades, but I barely scraped through the other ones. I lost interest in my hobbies; I gave up all extracurriculars because I felt guilty not studying but I wouldn‚Äôt even study.",
      "When I finally started with my thesis, matters took a turn for the worse. I was incredibly unsuited for research work, and after the first semester, I wasn‚Äôt getting almost anything done. I would barely step out of my room. I would read through the same research papers over and over, trying to make sense, but broke down so frequently that it didn‚Äôt feel normal; I felt slow and worthless. I had tied so much of my worth with ‚Äòbeing smart‚Äô that when this was taken away from me, my whole sense of identity had collapsed, leaving me with nothing. I started skipping meetings with my advisor because I assumed he wouldn‚Äôt understand anyway. I reached out to the Counselling Service for help at this point, but it didn‚Äôt seem to work.",
      "When my friends started submitting their theses, I stayed behind and told them that I should be ‚Äòdone with my thesis‚Äô in a few months. When my advisor told me he was giving me X grades, I couldn‚Äôt even process it. A committee decided to terminate my MTech degree and ordained me to work on a BTech project instead. This is where things got both better and worse. Worse, because when I appealed to the committee to consider one semester‚Äôs worth of work which I‚Äôd already done, as my BTP, they refused, because it wasn‚Äôt allowed for my batch and that ‚Äòeverybody else would want exceptions‚Äô. Better, because some student representatives in the Senate and department SUGC reached out to me, knowing about my case and hearing, and advised me, befriended me, got me out of my room, and quite literally, saved my life. Some kind professors in my department also helped me with the project, personally taking out time.",
      "I had already been visiting the Counselling Service for a while now by this time and was on medications in addition to therapy visits but even then, the attitude displayed towards me by professors, and even Counselling Service had been one of disdain. They called my parents, who didn‚Äôt know about my mental health situation, and speculated that I must be having relationship issues because I was clearly an otherwise-problem-free student. Some members also invalidated the existence of my depression, because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòclearly suicidal‚Äô. This is not to point fingers at anyone in particular, but I personally felt like the administration just hugely exacerbated my feelings of being burdensome and worthless.",
      "Fortunately for me, it turned out that I had invested much less trust in my parents than they deserved because they supported me through just surviving and getting out, even if it meant not getting a degree at all. I started working on the BTP and in a few months, I submitted it and joined the company from which I‚Äôd received an offer.",
      "When I think about it now, sometimes I still feel the shame. But I also feel relief, and disbelief, because what I had considered to be the end of the world, turned out to be just one lost year. I have learned what I need to do, on the job, and continue to learn what I didn‚Äôt during college. That said, I am grateful to my parents and friends who made me realise that a temporary setback didn‚Äôt have to define me and that we should never be ashamed of asking for help ‚Äì because you might just get it from the people you least expect it to.",

      "Vox Populi brings you the fourth edition of the series Unorthodox Career Choices. We interview people who have taken the leap of faith and bring their stories to you. This edition brings you the story of Udai Singh Pawar, an alumnus of the Y0 batch.¬†Udai Singh Pawar is a Director and a Writer, known for the Netflix Original Film Upstarts (2019). He was earlier an Associate Director, known for Airlift (2016) and Yeh Saali Zindagi (2011). A former scientist who worked in Microsoft Research, then a traveler who backpacked around the world for a year with a guitar and a camera, Udai has been working in cinema since 2009. Check out some excerpts from our conversation with Udai.",
      "How was your life as a scientist in Microsoft research? When and why did you decide to leave it?",
      "I did 5 years Integrated Physics at IITK. My 3rd-year internship was in an R&D dept of a film & technology company. In CSE dept, prof. Amitabha Mukherjee and Manu Prakash, a fellow student, used to set up a student activity called BRCS (build robots create science) which got me interested in education technology. My Microsoft job was improving education technology in a research-oriented manner. I got to publish a lot of research papers and also got a couple of patents. I really enjoyed that job.",
      "But soon I realised that a Ph.D. was essential to be a true researcher. I was not very keen on the idea of going back to some university for 5 years. In school we didn‚Äôt really have an option, we had to become an engineer and for that, we had to get into an IIT. But now that I was getting a choice, I felt that‚Äúhamesha to ye nahi karna hai, although achha hai‚Äù.",
      "Also, Microsoft paid a lot of money for research on village education. But the salary that I was getting was for providing computers in village schools. I could do 10 times better with the same salary than giving them computers so I felt a bit of a mismatch. My other love was traveling. I used my Microsoft savings to travel around the world for 1 year. After returning, I decided to go into films.",
      "",
      "How did you cross the mental threshold of leaving a well-to-do job and join the world of cinema? What motivated you to join cinemas? What was your family‚Äôs opinion?",
      "While I was in Microsoft, we had to fill a job review form every 6 months. It always had this question ‚Äì ‚ÄòHow do you see yourself in 5-10 years from now?‚Äô I never had a good answer to it.I had dived into the research-side too and I liked it, but I didn‚Äôt want to do it for the rest of my life. The mental shift happened when I realised that I had given the ‚Äúorthodox things‚Äù a good shot and I knew I‚Äôm good at those things, which gave me the confidence to listen to myself.In school, I was in the videography society. In IITK, I helped in the formation of the Film Club. After doing a job for 3 years and traveling 1 year, I really wanted to go into filming and this was the one chance.As my first job at Microsoft went well, I could tell my parents that I‚Äôm not useless, I‚Äôm not wasting my life!(laughs). My parents were obviously worried because Bollywood has a very low probability of success.",
      "",
      "How has your life changed after deciding to work in Cinema? Can you compare your day now to the one as a scientist?",
      "It was very different. Microsoft is a very disciplined, organized, and meritocratic company.¬† While the artistic life is very chaotic, the film industry lacks structure and is uncertain. Engineers like logic, order, certainty, and are not good at dealing with a lack of structure. That is why my first two years in Bombay were difficult and frustrating. It took me a while to get a hang of it. I learned that life is not just 2+2=4, or black and white, but life is in the grays. In the beginning, there was quite less guarantee of income. During my first 3 years in the film industry, I made one-tenth of what I made in Microsoft. One of the things is that you shoot for 2 months a year, and the remaining 10 months you try to make those 2 months happen. But in the end, making movies is the best job in the world for me.",
      "",
      "How difficult is it for someone with no family background in films to become a movie director in present India?",
      "It is quite difficult. The number of people trying is far, far greater than the number of seats, kind of similar to JEE. I think it‚Äôs an inefficient system: the system is not only based on merit but also requires a lot of luck. In my 11 years in Bombay, no one has ever read my resume completely. It is not a place for that; here you get introduced to someone from whom you meet someone else and after 100 attempts you get a proper chance and then you have to be good at it. In the end, it is a combination of luck as well as hard work. Also, film-making is a difficult skill that you can completely learn on the movie set itself.",
      "",
      "As we‚Äôre told, you entered the Indian Cinema in 2009, while you directed the movie ‚ÄúUpstarts‚Äù in 2019. Can you tell us something about the journey of these 10 years?",
      "I got nowhere for 3-4 months in the beginning. At one point, I got so desperate that I had to wait outside the house of a director with whom I wanted to work! He was very amused that being an IITian, I still want to work in this field. My first job in the film industry was to write blogs and Facebook posts for a movie. And I wasn‚Äôt paid for that. These odd jobs helped me make connections there. Then I got to know Sudhir Mishra, and he offered me a job in his upcoming movie. Eventually, I became an assistant director under him. Then after working as assistant director for 8 years and working in different movies, I finally got someone to put money in my film for me to be a director.",
      "",
      "What are some of the things that would have benefitted you if you had known them earlier, and who guided you during your initial phase in the Indian Cinema?",
      "There are some things which you can only learn by doing them. I made a lot of mistakes but I‚Äôm glad that I made them because that‚Äôs what got me here. A film is very much like a start-up. Suppose you work on a start-up idea for 1-2 years. If the idea works out, you would be glad that you did not leave it and if it doesn‚Äôt work out, you would regret working on it. Working in movies is similar. My last movie as an assistant director came out in 2016 andUpstartswas released in 2019. Now I feel that I should have focused on more than one project in those three years.",
      "One of my two mentors is Raja Krishna Menon who is the producer ofUpstarts. He is also the director ofAirlift. He was ready to produce a movie written by me. So he is the one who gave me a big break. My other Mentor was Sudhir Mishra with whom I worked during my first 5 years.",
      "",
      "Who are your role models in the film industry? Which directors do you wish to emulate?",
      "It‚Äôs a hard question because we‚Äôve got many good directors. The directors whom I look up to in Bollywood are Sudhir Mishra, Anurag Kashyap, and Dibakar Banarjee. Zoya Akhtar is one of the best directors in a long time. I also admire Raja Menon who was my first boss, Sriram Raghavan, who directedAndhadhun. Vijay Anand, the director ofGuide, and Guru Dutt, who has madePyaasawere one of the greats in the olden days. In the west, I appreciate the work ofSteven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson.",
      "",
      "How has the Indian cinema evolved from when you used to watch movies as a child to now?",
      "Every generation thinks,‚ÄúPehle sab accha tha, ab sab ganda ho raha hai‚Äù, as if they‚Äôre the last good generation. Some things were better in the ‚Äô80s and some things are better now. I separate craft from art. Craft includes production value, techniques, and technology, which have definitely improved now. Also, story-telling has improved. On the other hand, it‚Äôs become mainstream to produce big-budget films that aren‚Äôt great writings, even in Hollywood. Currently, the cinema is dominated by big stars, lacking less famous actors. Earlier, many actors weren‚Äôt very big stars, like Nasiruddin Shah, Om Puri, and Sharmila Tagore. Nowadays, there are either very big films or very small films. The middle ground is missing.",
      "",
      "How do you see movies as a means of bringing about a social change?",
      "It‚Äôs a very complicated question. Some people see movies as art while, for some, it‚Äôs just entertainment. So the fundamental question is, how art can change society. Some pieces of art can, some pieces can‚Äôt. Some pieces are defined for it, some aren‚Äôt. Similarly, some movies that are designed to create an impact, some aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a petty example, but consider, Dil Chahta hai; People started keeping their beards like that of Aamir Khan in it. I don‚Äôt think people or their lives will change after watching a single movie, but movies, as a whole, can raise questions to society and reinforce different ideas. One major change can be seen in the gender of a lead role. Earlier, only a man used to be in the main lead. Nowadays, more women are being cast in the lead role.",
      "",
      "What are your thoughts on the notion of art movies vs commercial movies? And which one of the two do you prefer?",
      "You can write a novel sitting alone in a room. You can create art using paint and brush. But, a film, by definition, requires many people. My movie,Upstarts, even though a small movie, had a crew of 153 members. Making a movie requires a lot of money and in return, requires making money. Every film, hence, is a commercial film. An artistic movie might not always make a lot of money, but it will be more provoking. A movie shouldn‚Äôt be made only to seek money. But, a movie needs to make money. I believe the movie should be balanced on both sides.",
      "",
      "What work have you done in the film industry so far? What are your goals for the future?",
      "I worked as an assistant director with Sudhir Mishra, for 5 years. My first film wasYeh Saali Zindagi, starring Irrfan Khan. Then, I worked onInkaar, featuring Arjun Rampal, which is available on Netflix. Then, I started working onMehrunissa, with its probable lead actors as Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor, but it never got made. Then, I worked onAirliftas an associate director. The Airlift director was, in fact, the producer of my next movieUpstartswhich was written and directed by me. Making a film is like a start-up. You make a film and as soon as it gets over, you need to come up with a new idea. My future goal is simply to be a mainstream director as I‚Äôm still a new one.",
      "",
      "How did your IITK years influence your career choices and shape your overall personality, and coming from a technical institute, has your technical knowledge helped you in your field of work?",
      "An engineering institute trains your mind to work in a structured and logical manner, more than teaching you. I disagree with people saying that they haven‚Äôt used what they‚Äôve studied. I don‚Äôt use Physics in my work, but the problem solving that I‚Äôve done helps a lot. It‚Äôs not necessary, but having some knowledge about the technical courses, it somewhere benefits me, like in sound mixing, although it‚Äôs just a small impact.In IITs, we have Galaxy, and the creative ambition that it induces in someone is immense. I met some of the most creative people in my life on campus. Just because you‚Äôre engineers, just because you crossed JEE, just because you‚Äôve not learned professional art doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not artists.Also, the people I talk to the most are my wingmates. I lived with my batchmates during the first job I did in Bangalore. In Bombay, they even helped me even though I was unable to return back to them because I had very little money for a while, and I‚Äôm still friends with them. So my IITK years have influenced my whole life monumentally. Even my father‚Äôs from IITD and he‚Äôs best friends with his batchmates.It‚Äôs something magical about being from an IIT because you‚Äôre part of something so unique, you suffer so much together.‚ÄúMTH 101 mein sab fail hote hain, vahi gande se bathroom mein sabko nahana hota hai, vahi khaana sabko khaana hota hai.‚Äù",
      "",
      "What message would you like to give to the student community of IITK?",
      "Oh, too many messages!(laughs)People stay quitedukhiin IIT-K.Never think that you‚Äôre alone, there is someone who is suffering as much as you are, maybe more. You will find people like yourself in the campus, get to know them. If you feel alone because ‚ÄúLife me pyaar nahi hai‚Äù, don‚Äôt worry life gets better!(laughs). Even the ten-pointers face ups and downs in their life. I feel that this intense environment makes you better. You‚Äôll always find someone with the same odds, same problems, and same fears as yourself. As IITians, we have a sense of ego and we don‚Äôt share our worries and insecurities. We let it burn and bubble inside us, but you shouldn‚Äôt suffer silently. Whatever you want to do, be it establishing a start-up or code or go into research, there will be someone in the same boat. Life won‚Äôt be ideal, but it‚Äôll get better. You are not just a part of some batch, you are a part of a solid, 60 years of history! You‚Äôve got a strong network of alumni, reach out to them, without hesitation!",

      "Vox Populi brings you the third edition of the series Unorthodox Career Choices. We interview people who have taken the leap of faith and bring their stories to you. This edition brings you the story of Ashutosh Ranka, an alumnus of the UG Y13 batch. After serving as the President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana 2016-17, he joined McKinsey. After 1.5 years, he joined Aam Aadmi Party as a full-time politician. Check out some excerpts from our conversation with Ashutosh.",
      "Tell us about your story. How did you join politics and what motivated you towards joining politics?",
      "While I have been motivated to work for the country since my school days, it is difficult to relate the decision of joining politics to a single incident or story. An experience that I distinctly remember is watching Rang de Basanti in 2005- the movie struck a chord with me! I realized that there is a lot of mess in the country and to sort out the mess, I need to be a part of that mess. That is when I decided I wanted to work for the country, but that I wanted to join politics was decided after my tenure as the President, Student Gymkhana at IITK.",
      "As the president, I realized that being in power gives us the opportunity to work for the community. So, although I joined Mckinsey after graduation, I knew I wanted to join politics.",
      "It so happened that about 1.5 years into the job, I looked around to find all my close friends pursuing their passions- three were pursuing UPSC preparation, one had opened his startup and one had left her job for higher studies. That is when I thought if my friends are doing what they wanted to do, then why don‚Äôt I pursue my dreams as well? That is when I quit my job and joined Aam Aadmi Party full time.",
      "",
      "With a high paying job and a promising career ahead, how did you cross the mental threshold of giving it all up? And how did your family and friends react?",
      "No doubt, my job at Mckinsey was very lucrative and promising. I could‚Äôve any-day applied to a top B school. So, definitely, it was a huge mental barrier, to give it all up. But then I ultimately realized that it was just a ‚Äòmental‚Äô barrier. While I had a good job, I knew that I did not want to do consultancy. And I believe that you can only excel in something you really want to do. So, overcoming the mental barrier was a lot about coming to peace with myself. Once that happened, it mattered less to me what others said about the choice I made.",
      "Coming to my family, honestly, they were shit scared (laughs)as every Indian middle-class family would be. But then I talked to my parents and asked them to allow me just a year to experiment. If it works out, there‚Äôll be no one happier than you (his parents). If it doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll get back to my corporate life. They agreed and that‚Äôs how I quit my job and joined politics.",
      "",
      "Shifting from a McKinsey job to a political volunteer, what were the changes in your lifestyle?",
      "There were broadly three differences.",
      "Firstly, life in McKinsey was very structured- I had 9-5 working hours, no-work weekends. While in political life, there is no structure. There are no weekends as well. When we have elections, I work 17-18 hours for all 7 days. Other days are relaxed generally.",
      "Secondly, political work is very ad-hoc. In my 1.5 years at Mckinsey, I worked in 3 different industries, on different projects, but I was essentially doing the same thing- solving problems, one at a time. On the other hand in politics, work varies week to week, ranging from election campaigns, social media to say, working on the corona crisis or a primary service.",
      "Thirdly, unlike corporate life, politics lacks a strict hierarchy.",
      "Honestly, most of these lifestyle changes do not matter if you enjoy your own profession. During my Presidential tenure, I had a similar lifestyle-har roz kuch na kuch hota thaand I used to love that life. So my political life is essentially college life rehappening for me, at a larger scale.",
      "",
      "Do you get paid by the party to work as a political volunteer? How do you earn your livelihood?",
      "AAP is a more or less public-funded party and so expecting to make a living out of AAP would be stupid. However, I have heard that the case is different for other national parties with huge corporate fundings.",
      "That said, I did manage to get a pay, last year, only because it was election season and it is during elections that parties spend most of their money. Once the election is over, it is a different scenario and you need to make arrangements to earn a livelihood. Honestly, for people like us coming from IITs, it is not difficult to make other arrangements like a part-time job. It just requires more effort. For example, I am currently working for the Delhi Assembly Research Fellowship.",
      "For me, I had enough savings from my Mckinsey stint to survive for the next couple of years. But, if I take a much more general view, then a newcomer who is planning to step into politics for like forever, needs to figure out beforehand, how he‚Äôll earn his livelihood.",
      "",
      "Tell us about your work as a political volunteer so far. What are you working on now?",
      "I joined AAP around the Lok Sabha elections in March 2019. Then, I was managing the campaign of Atishi Marlena, in one of the assembly constituencies in her Lok Sabha constituency of East Delhi. After the Lok Sabha elections, came a lull period followed by the preparations for Assembly Elections, which was a do or die election for the party. This time around I was managing WhatsApp outreach for AAP and was also the election observer for Manish Sisodia. An election observer basically oversees all campaign-related activity in a particular constituency. Two months right before the state elections, I became the campaign manager for a candidate, managing all the aspects of the campaign in the constituency, be it logistics or teams.",
      "After the elections, I started working on governance and right now I am involved in making the action plan for countering the pollution in Delhi.",
      "",
      "What are your aims/goals for the future?",
      "Politics is a very long race. You don‚Äôt succeed in 1-2 years- You might but that‚Äôs not how I want to take it. If we look at all the successful leaders around us say Arvind Kejriwal or Modi, they all have a very long journey behind them. Arvind worked for 10-12 years in Delhi slums; Modi has been in politics since, 40-45 years. This is why these leaders know the ground very well, they know how people think, what people want.",
      "If I work for the party, I might get a ticket in the next 4-5 years, if not Delhi, then at least in some other state. But that‚Äôs not how I want to approach it. I want to live this journey of mine and understand the ground before I contest for office. I am planning to contest for office about 10 years from now.",
      "",
      "How do you compare politics as a means of social change with other ways, namely NGOs and civil services?",
      "I have a very strong opinion on this- it might not be the right one. I don‚Äôt find a way more impactful than politics to bring social change in a country like India.",
      "Suppose, there‚Äôs an NGO that wants to imbibe the culture of entrepreneurship in school students. The NGO will start with few schools; establish credibility; then expand to more schools; gain government trust and then scale up to 500-600 schools. It will take an NGO about 20-30 years to make the kind of impact the Delhi government was able to make in 2 months by including entrepreneurship curriculum in schools. Today, 7.5 lakh students take entrepreneurship classes.",
      "Talking about bureaucracy, in my last Mckinsey project, I was working with the UP health ministry and interacted with some senior secretaries in the UP government. I realized despite all of the secretaries being in very high positions and having a lot of power, they do not call the shots. They have to work on the instructions of the ministers. This is the only reason I did not pursue civil services, and chose politics instead.",
      "",
      "Considering that you have led AAP‚Äôs WhatsApp Outreach team, what are your thoughts on the fake news and communally loaded messages floated by political parties during elections?",
      "To be honest, WhatsApp during elections is very dirty, dirtier than one can imagine! And I am really worried about this. Of all the social media platforms, WhatsApp is the worst, because WhatsApp doesn‚Äôt have a face. When you post something on Facebook or Instagram, it has a face, I see that some random guy posted it. On WhatsApp, you can simply forward with no accountability, that‚Äôs what makes it very dangerous. So it‚Äôs grossly misused as a propaganda machine.",
      "The country is much more polarised than ever before, thanks to WhatsApp. Political leaders don‚Äôt speak every day, but Whatsapp goes on 365 days a year, and it‚Äôs been going on since the last 4-5 years, vigorously fueling the spread of fake news. This is extremely worrying and dangerous There‚Äôs a lot that needs to be done to curb this, but currently, no measure is being taken to control the same.",
      "",
      "Tell us about your stay at IIT-K and your experience as the President, Students‚Äô Gymkhana, and how did it change your overall personality?",
      "I have always acknowledged that IITK is what shaped me, it actually gave me the visibility and the confidence of doing great things in life. As the President, I worked on various issues: some radical ones like drugs and substance abuse, others which would really help Gymkhana in the long term, like external sponsorship for Gymkhana and student entrepreneurship. That‚Äôs when I realized that being in power gives you an opportunity to work for the community.",
      "I think, all the unorthodox career choices made by IITK students over time are greatly influenced by the 4 years they spent here, thanks to the breadth of opportunities that IITK provides.",
      "",
      "What are the differences that you see in IITK now and IITK then?",
      "I have strong opinions on this. The fact that 1st-yearstudents are denied the opportunity to live with their seniors is very concerning and disheartening. I owe a lot to my seniors for their guidance with my placements, internships, and academics, as well as I had some of my best experiences on the campus due to interaction with seniors.",
      "Also, the rigour and passion to win Galaxy pushed me to my limits.Galaxy ke wo 4 din mere liye utne hi intense hote the jitne aaj Election ke hote hain. That level of inter hall rivalry is missing these days. So, I am emotionally attached to the culture that shaped me and I‚Äôd like it to thrive.",
      "Having said that, I also acknowledge that cultures are meant to evolve and there is nothing right or wrong about it. Like every change, it has negative and positive effects. For example, unlike now, we despised speaking in English and I don‚Äôt even know why (laughs).",
      "",
      "How do you compare national politics and the politics in IITK, or in general in IITs?",
      "Politics at IITK has broadly two aspects. The first one is the inter hall politics and the second is PG politics, which slightly resembles national politics as it has a religious and social angle to it.",
      "90% of pre-election campaigning in IITK is free from religious, caste, and community bias. This is starkly different from national politics. Post-election governance in IITK is more professional as compared to national politics as all IITK junta is very action-oriented.",
      "Additionally, the IITK community is very ignorant towards Gymkhana, IITK politics, or national politics. We have a low voter turnout (35-40% in my time), but on the other hand, national politics has a greater turnout, ranging around 60-70%. People at IITK are agnostic of Gymkhana- partially because of Gymkhana‚Äôs inability to convey its importance and partially because people are chilled out and don‚Äôt care about student affairs as much.",
      "Talking about other IITs, the caste and religious perspectives become significant in IIT Madras while IIT KGP has open debates, resulting in more intense elections and politics.",
      "",
      "Lastly, what message would you like to give to the student community?",
      "There are two broad messages I want to give-Get involved in national affairs and Step out of the rat race.",
      "On the first suggestion, it is important to have informed opinions on national issues, since it is people like you and me who will hold influential positions and will have a say in national matters. Currently, many alumni have the power to drive the agenda but they don‚Äôt, because of ignorance and lack of opinions since college days.¬† Although, during my tenure as President, I also believed that IITK should be kept away from national politics as I didn‚Äôt want organizations like ABVP/NSUI/CYSS to get involved in IITK politics. But now, I believe I was partially wrong because due to this, IITK students either lack a political opinion or have a very uninformed one.",
      "For the second suggestion, I want you to remember the dialogue from 3 Idiots where Rancho talks about the ‚Äòrat race‚Äô and all of us had a hearty laugh then. But 1.5 years into McKinsey, I realized that I was actually a part of that rat race. I realized that I was in McKinsey not because I wanted to do consulting, but because everyone on campus said that it is the best thing to do after IIT. Engineering from IIT, a job in a consulting company, MBA from an IIM, or Stanford are like goal-posts set by the society and most of us are racing to achieve these goal posts and have no idea what they are doing and why they are doing it.",
      "My suggestion, especially to the graduating batch and recent alumni, is that please reflect on what you really want to do in life. I am not asking you to not do consulting or not do an MBA. If you have a nag for managerial work, do it!",
      "All that I am asking you to do is make informed decisions because you would not want to be a 40 year old realizing one day as to how much more fulfilling life could have been- just if you had followed your passion!",

      "I am natively from Kota itself, and the first time I heard about IITs was when I was in the 9th grade. Then till 11th, all I knew was that you had to crack an exam to get into an IIT, and I wanted my shot at it. I managed to convince my father to let me sideline 12th boards and spend money to get me coached at Resonance for JEE. The following 2 years were slightly depressing. I couldn‚Äôt crack JEE in my first attempt, but I got a good enough rank after repeating a year to earn admission in IIT Kanpur in the MTH department.",
      "My academic performance was average in college from the 1st year itself. I had failed in ESC101 and MTH101. Being from a reserved category, I was told that the competition would be difficult for me to handle and I was under pressure to perform well right from the start. My performance never really improved significantly and it was always a struggle.",
      "Socially, I always felt cut-off from the rest of my peers and outside friend circles too as I always had a bit of insecurity and underconfidence. In my first semester, I managed to make only one or two friends. To be fair it‚Äôs not very probable to find your type of people among your ‚Äòbehens‚Äô, you have to hunt for friends. I had little to none contact with the batchmates and seniors of my department (MTH), and I think that added to my academic struggles.¬† The situation improved in the second semester as I joined athletics and was able to make a few friends there and a good group was in formation. But in the fourth semester, I got overwhelmed with academic work in the form of departmental courses and had to quit athletics.",
      "I entered into the first romantic relationship of my life with a fellow Athletics teammate in my second year which started out as extremely time-consuming. I couldn‚Äôt give enough time to my demanding academics, my co-curricular activities, or my newly made female friends hence destroying my social life completely. Even though he was introverted and resisted sharing personal things, he had a lot of friends thanks to crowded wings in the male hostels. So he never had to face the problem of isolation that I had to. Even academically, he used to perform decently well.",
      "Entering our 3rd year and realizing higher amounts of pressure caused by internships, he started focussing on his studies and spending more time with his friends, ignoring me completely. He used to avoid seeing me, which was very difficult for me since now I didn‚Äôt have the few friends I used to in my second year. I couldn‚Äôt handle the abrupt change. My new room was isolated from the rest of my batch and I didn‚Äôt even talk to my roommate, let alone the neighbors. My semester was overloaded with courses that I had dropped in my 2nd year.",
      "One day, we had a fight and I left the room in a state of anger to go cycle around in order to calm down. When I returned to my room, I saw my broken trophy, glass stained by a banana, and other things thrown around lying in a messed-up room. I was very angry and disturbed by his behavior and it made me realize I needed to get a handle on things. I was able to make two to three PG friends doing their masters at the time so I did have people to talk to, but they were only there for a year more.",
      "Due to some bad decision making, I took up five compulsory departmental courses in my fifth semester which resulted in me failing 3 out of the 5 courses. My only priority now was finishing my degree on time. That December brought some of the lowest days of my college life as I was facing monumental academic and personal problems. Sitting at my home, I texted him saying that I wanted to break up since I was feeling very sad and irritated. He started crying about how he has some family issues and that he even missed the Inter IIT tryouts because of the bad mood I put him in. Since I was not determined enough to break up, I gave in and decided not to and he later admitted that he didn‚Äôt go to the tryouts because he didn‚Äôt think he would get selected (which was a fair self-assessment :p, but I couldn‚Äôt demotivate him). Now, I think that he just tried to manipulate me and used my kindness to his advantage.",
      "More fights occurred after I got back for the sixth semester. In a fit of anger, he slapped me and said that I should never even think of breaking up. At that time, I did not pay much heed to the incident. I went to the Counselling Service to improve the state of my mental health and the counselor asked me to visit her with my boyfriend and so I did but he wasn‚Äôt interested in the process at all. The counselor gave us a task. She asked us to write down the problems and expectations which we had with the relationship on a piece of paper and to share them with each other regularly. He didn‚Äôt do the task even after the multiple times I asked him to. He used to break down and start crying about how I‚Äôll break up with him and that just saddened me more. He used to lock himself in his room for long intervals of time and miss all his lectures. And it was always up to me to console him.",
      "He refused to break up and he refused to make an effort to improve our equation, and I felt completely helpless. So I thought, focus on the semester for now. My previous PG friends graduated, but I did make a new one over the sixth semester and summers, so I used to talk to her about my troubling issues.",
      "The seventh semester arrived, and he was still ignoring me. I understood that placements were near and he needed to prepare, so I didn‚Äôt try to cause more breakdowns or drama. My birthday arrived in August, and I was rightfully angry since he hadn‚Äôt even wished me. I asked him to go to the mall with me, but he barely showed any interest. So I decided not to bother him and went with a male friend of mine, leaving my room unlocked. He called me, and I could tell by his tone that he was very angry. When I came back to my room, everything was already a mess. This time my laptop was broken, along with some lights I had put up. He came by later to tell me that he was waiting for me on the road and if we had taken that route, he would have beaten up my friend then and there.",
      "Another disturbing incident I remember is when we were walking on the road near GH1 and we had an argument, which led to him hitting me on the head. Even then I was the one who had to get over it and console him by saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù and ‚Äújust do not do it again‚Äù to stop him from feeling bad about it.",
      "By the time the placement season ended, I was very afraid of him and his temper and extremely distressed due to the aforementioned incidents. Our equation didn‚Äôt improve, and he didn‚Äôt pay heed to any of my requests. I was really scared at that time and I started trying my best to avoid his anger but similar scarring incidents and arguments kept taking place.",
      "I found breaking up on campus impossible because I had no support there. No one to talk to. Whenever I hinted at breaking up, he used to throw a fit of anger and start misbehaving with me until the point where I had to give up. I used to hope that somehow things would improve in the future. That maybe he would be supportive in the future and start understanding my problems. I truly believed that people can change for good. But things only worsened. He used to feel very insecure and would try to manipulate me in those bouts of insecurity. I started to feel like I was out of control of my own life.",
      "Our relationship slowly deteriorated even further after graduation. He was in Gurgaon for his job, while I was preparing for UPSC in Delhi. Whatever little conversations we had were only through text. All conversations finally stopped after Aug 2019, a year after my graduation.",
      "When we broke up, he shifted all blame to me, even I started blaming myself thinking it was all my fault and how I had hurt him. Only by December when I found more about him, did I finally realize how manipulative and abusive he had actually been, both physically and emotionally. I hit a new low realizing this, realizing that I am not the one to blame.",
      "I still am in a healing phase. When you have invested 4-5 years of your life in one person and they have impacted you in such a way, only God knows how long it would take to eventually feel free and normal again. When I made the public post in the Y14 group, I found support from friends who had also gone through this. I found three male friends who were extremely helpful in the process. They used to uplift me, listen to all of my rants, and steer me away from negative thoughts. Whenever I wanted to call my ex-boyfriend, knowing very well how abusive and toxic he was, they always convinced me not to. I guess maybe because of them I could come out of this phase relatively easily. I talked to counselors on the YourDost app recently, and that has also helped me manage. I used to suffer from insomnia but I started running again and I am in a much better state now.",
      "I learned quite a lot from my experiences. First and foremost, it is essential to have friends of the same gender, batch, and department. You must identify supportive friends who would help you without being judgemental. When I used to talk to my only friend about the problems, she would shift all blame and guilt on me as if I was the one with all the faults but you need people around to tell you that you are not. Friends should at least understand when something wrong is happening.",
      "Secondly, never invest so much in one person and never trust anyone blindly. I still remember this one time I got full marks in a quiz and he would not believe me. He always blamed me for all our problems. Do not keep such negative people around yourself.",
      "Third, maybe rather than being too optimistic, you should be prepared with backups if things get really bad. Also, always devote time and genuine effort to academics üôÇ",

      "In this modern world, you should be aware of this wide range of alternative careers that are there to choose from other than the regular jobs which are opted by the majority of students.In this series by Vox Populi, we interview alums who opted for unorthodox career paths.",
      "Today, we interview Samarth Bansal, an alumnus of the UG Y11 batch. Samarth‚Äôs team revamped the Vox Populi in 2014 and launched its digital edition‚Äîthe website where you are reading this.¬† In four years of professional journalism, Samarth has worked as a full-time staffer with the data journalism teams of The Hindu and the Hindustan Times. He was awarded the Alfred Friendly Press Partners Fellowship in 2018 which led him to work with the investigative reporting team of the Wall Street Journal for five months at its New York City headquarters. Now he works as a freelance reporter in New Delhi and writes for various Indian and international publications.¬† Here are some of the excerpts from our conversation with Samarth.",
      "",
      "Q: How did you decide to opt for a career in journalism?",
      "It was not a part of the plan. My friends knew me as a techie interested in building a technology startup. There are two parts to this answer: first, my involvement with Vox and second, making the career choice.",
      "On Vox:I loved blogging. I started right after JEE, and my first post explained the physics of bowling. I published infrequently, but I really enjoyed writing: be it about personal musings or campus affairs. That interest led me to Vox Populi. A friend and I revamped the journalism society in 2014, setting up this website and getting people interested in campus journalism. I enjoyed this journey a lot.",
      "For the career choice, here is some background: In my third semester, I had consciously decided to not sit for campus placements in the last year. I was caught up by the entrepreneurial bug at the time: the phase where techie teenagers idolize Steve Jobs. It was quite liberating because I got rid of the calculative decisions many of my friends made to do well at the campus placements.",
      "In my fourth semester, I started working for an early stage startup in Mumbai as the lead software developer. It was a great experience. I did this for a couple of years and then decided to move on.",
      "Quite ironically, my curiosity to explore the world beyond software into other exciting realms of technology‚Äîhardware, energy, materials‚Äîled me to a job in journalism. It so happened that two days before my mid-semester exams in the eighth semester, I went to participate in a policy hackathon organized by Harvard in New Delhi. I went alone, made a team on the spot and built a super simpleInternet of Thingsproduct: the problem statement was to use data and tech for coping with the so-called ‚Äútanker mafia‚Äù in Delhi‚Äôs water system where water from tankers doesn‚Äôt reach the localities. So my team built a simple device to embed in the tankers that detects water levels through a sensor, transmits the data to a central dashboard where authorities can monitor and detect fraudulent patterns. Judges were impressed and we won the hackathon. That got us a fully sponsored ten day trip to Boston. How fun! That apart, one of the judges in the panel was an editor at The Hindu and I later learnt that the paper was looking to hire people interested in data journalism. I wrote to the editor to enquire more and that led me to an internship in the newspaper‚Äôs National Bureau in New Delhi. That was it. I enjoyed it so much that I have stayed in journalism since then.",
      "I started with data/computational journalism‚Äîwhere, simply put, we use data analysis and graphics to inform our reporting and tell stories‚Äîand eventually into what doesn‚Äôt neatly fit into any fixed category of journalistic work. I still wrangle datasets to find stories, but my work is now much broader than that. You can call it a mix of explanatory journalism and investigations, and technology/data skills are extremely valuable there.",
      "So that‚Äôs the story. I did not ‚Äúfollow my passion‚Äù. Journalism happened to me by chance. It was an accident. And I am glad it happened. That‚Äôs the most honest explanation I can give you.",
      "I think we often downplay the role of chance in our lives, and how randomness dictates so much that happens to us. It‚Äôs easy to attribute causality to a certain event to make sense of what happened next. But that‚Äôs hindsight reasoning. There is a lot of literature on this topic and if you are interested, Nassim Nicholas Taleb‚ÄôsFooled by Randomnessis a great starting point. Read it. I sometimes wonder what I would be doing had I not gone to the hackathon and rather studied for semester exams! (laughs)",
      "",
      "Q: How is your life as a freelance journalist?",
      "It‚Äôs completely different than having a full time job‚Äîand for the good, at least for me. Work is no longer the central part of my life. The institutions we are part of and the work we do there become a part of our identity: that erodes in many ways as a freelancer. There is no concept of weekdays or weekends. Every day is different. For instance, if I am desperate to finish a new book, I can just not work for two days and read; or meet friends in the afternoon and work late in the evening. Then there are weeks where I am packed with assignments and have to work every day. That flexibility is quite powerful.",
      "And the flexibility allows me to take up long term reporting assignments and look beyond the news cycle.",
      "",
      "Q: Where do you work if you don‚Äôt have an office? And what about finances?",
      "I mostly work out of coffee shops in Delhi. I have my list of 5-6 favorite spots that are work-friendly and that‚Äôs where I spend most of my working time if I am not on a reporting assignment.",
      "As for the pay, yes, that‚Äôs variable. You don‚Äôt earn a fixed amount every month. So I set an annual goal and plan accordingly. You need to figure out a model to sustain yourself financially.",
      "There is no formula for it. What is crucial is to have clearly defined goals, figure out your risk model and work towards it. I can recommend another book here:An Economist Walks Into A Brothelby Allison Schrager. It‚Äôs an easy read and helped me think about risk in everyday life.",
      "",
      "Q: Tell us about Indian journalism and press freedom. What is it like?",
      "Strictly speaking, free press in India is a myth. There are many pressures the big media faces, both economic and from the government. Everyone manages it differently. Having said that, there are ample opportunities to pursue independent journalism. I often say there is no such thing as ‚Äúthe media‚Äù‚Äîa clearly defined collective. It does not exist. Print newspaper journalism is very different than television, and both are very different from digital media. The medium of communication changes what constitutes news and how it is delivered. This is an underappreciated fact of how journalism works.",
      "Economics of journalism is the biggest barrier to its freedom. Advertisement revenue ‚Äî that has sustained journalism for decades ‚Äî is shifting to big tech companies like Google and Facebook, and for good reason: they provide more value to advertisers. Add to that, that a great chunk‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have the exact numbers‚Äîof the ad pie comes from government ads: cutting off ads from a newspaper for critical reporting is a powerful form of controlling news in the hands of the government. That leads to self-censorship, which is a big concern.",
      "Figuring out a business model to sustain news in the digital age, filling in the trust deficit, helping people navigate information overload, good curation are some of the crucial challenges that journalism faces today.",
      "Raj Kamal Jha, the editor-in-chief ofIndian Express,aptly described the state of Indian journalism in 2016: ‚ÄúGood journalism is not dying; it is getting better and bigger. It‚Äôs just bad journalism makes a lot more noise than it used to do five years ago.‚Äù",
      "",
      "Q: What is the role of technology in journalism?",
      "A lot. The role of technology in journalism has increased and it will continue to increase. It helps journalists tell better stories through the web, which is an interactive medium; find stories in large data sets; do open-source investigations and find evidence through realms of digital trails people leave on the internet. That‚Äôs just the reporting side. Then there‚Äôs the whole field of distribution: how do you deliver stories to people, through different mediums, in the most effective way? How do you make news products tailored in line with people‚Äôs information consumption preferences? There are a lot of problems in the media industry as a whole ‚Äì all open for creative destruction at the moment. It‚Äôs quite exciting.",
      "I am also working on a project‚Äîparallel to my regular reporting assignments‚Äîwhere we are building bots that automatically write news stories based on high-frequency data. The larger field is called ‚Äúnatural language generation‚Äù. A friend and I are building this for a range of Indian datasets: economy, politics, environment, commodities, among other things. You will see more on it in the coming months. Our early experiments have been pretty good.",
      "",
      "Q: Tell us more about your association with Vox Populi.",
      "As far as I know, Vox Populi was started in the early 2000s. I have read the archives, and our seniors did a really good job.",
      "During my time as a student, Vox was not very active. I don‚Äôt know what exactly happened, but we didn‚Äôt have a strong journalism body. There wasn‚Äôt even a website. In my final year, a friend and I got the chance to revamp things and start from scratch: that‚Äôs how voxiitk.com came into existence.",
      "Back then, we didn‚Äôt have a strong team as you guys have now. Not many people were interested. We gave a series of presentations to encourage people to join Vox and gradually built a team. We launched¬† Vox‚Äôs first website on 3rd August 2014 (he remembers the date distinctly and says it with a sense of nostalgia)¬† along with the Facebook page.",
      "",
      "Q: What do you think about the future of Vox Populi?",
      "I have been in touch with all the chief editors since I graduated. Here are a few things we often discuss.",
      "First, we need to focus on our editorial quality: how we write stories, language, narrative arc, all of that.",
      "Second, many stories that Vox attempts fall in the cracks. Either students lose interest, or they keep on researching endlessly, and hence don‚Äôt end up publishing stuff. That needs to be fixed.",
      "Third, Vox must challenge the administration. Vox‚Äôs vision has always been to be an independent fearless voice on the campus. I think the recent events at the campus says enough about why that is needed. Be critical about the campus, and don‚Äôt worry that writing stories will lead to negative publicity of IIT Kanpur.",
      "Fourth, we should focus on the opinion section. I always wanted Vox to be a platform for everyone: professors, students, staff or the admin. If anyone wants to share their views, they should be encouraged to write on Vox‚Äôs platform. Vox needs more contributions and opinions from people outside the core team.",
      "",
      "Q: What is your view on current administration at IIT Kanpur?",
      "It‚Äôs mind-boggling, to say the least. I wrote an opinion piece for Vox with a friend on what‚Äôs going on at the campus. While talking to students for that piece, it was concerning to know the systematic curbing of student freedom. I find it difficult to believe this is the place I graduated from just a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Q: Do you have any message for current students of IIT Kanpur?",
      "First, if you have a knack for problem solving, start with small issues around. It is a great learning experience. Anything from how utilities in hostels function to changes in the academic system, if you care about it, work on them.",
      "Second, we need to do away with mass narratives: stuff like what is a good department, what constitutes a good job, what‚Äôs a good salary, all of that. People‚Äôs preferences are dictated by their context.",
      "For instance, I can‚Äôt even imagine working at an investment bank. It just does not fit in with the lifestyle I prefer. So that‚Äôs a terrible job for me. It might be good for someone else. But the sense that a job at a certain bank is the coolest at campus doesn‚Äôt make sense.",
      "Same for salary: say two people make Rs X per annum. One lives with family and doesn‚Äôt have to pay rent, and free to keep the entire salary: spend, save, whatever, The other moved to a big city, has to clear off a family loan, and also has to support the education of siblings. Their requirements would be wildly different: Rs X is not the same for both. So we need to factor that in.",
      "This also applies to the narratives around departments. Think about biological engineering: if you look at the global trends, it‚Äôs one of the most exciting spaces for innovation. But I often find students don‚Äôt value it enough.",
      "Much of this I think is dictated by the campus placement market. In my view, we misunderstand the role of the Students‚Äô Placement Office. Their mandate is clear: increase the percentage of people who get placed. They optimize for the number of people who get placed. It‚Äôs not their prerogative to fill in for individual needs and preferences. So think about what you want for yourself, what fits in best for you and take the leap.",
      "Lastly, for the freshers, be careful about the fundas which second and third year students give you. They know as little as you do. Try to connect with more alumni, and for campus stuff, to fourth year students.",
      "",
      "Q: Do you have any suggestions for students interested in journalism?",
      "I have four suggestions to anyone even remotely interested in journalism or writing.",
      "First, you have to be curious. This is not a suggestion as much it is an indication of whether journalism is for you. That‚Äôs what drives the quest to find out new things and report stories. In which other profession will you be paid to ask questions about the world, find out the answers, read about it, talk to the best people in the field and sharing what you find with the public? It‚Äôs a great job for curious people.",
      "Second, read. Read a lot and read widely. My reading compliments my journalism a lot, it‚Äôs a source of ideas as well as understanding how to approach complex ideas. I wish I had read more during university.",
      "Third, write. Do independent blogging. Write for the campus newspaper. Your writing may be amateurish but put the stuff out and get feedback. You have no idea how embarrassing my blog was, both in terms of writing and the quality of ideas‚Äîand I did not realize it for years. (laughs). But you can‚Äôt grow if you don‚Äôt start somewhere. ¬† If you look up at my very first blogs, even I would be ashamed of them!",
      "Fourth, if you are genuinely interested in exploring journalism as a career option, do internships.¬† Look beyond the SPO. Reach out to organisations where you want to work at. It takes effort but you can find some way. Ask your seniors and alums for help.",

There are no easy answers and Butterscotch nods from outside.",

As the French philosopher Michel Foucault said, ‚ÄúHe is seen, but he does not see; he is the object of information, never a subject in communication‚Äù, I am but reduced to a set of appearances for the judgements of the observer, so be those for his well meaning intentions or for his perversions, it does not matter for I do not see. Back at the hostel gate I am drawn to a confrontation happening between the SIS guard and a hall resident. The entry of non residential females has been barred by the decree of warden until parents are informed.[3]And just when I thought I had left the unease behind, it returns.",
      "I wait the confrontation out to engage the SIS guard in a conversation while a camera shamelessly looks at us. ‚ÄúKeep standing, that is what we have been told, if you sit, if you go fetch water, if you take a pee break we will know and we will come for you,‚Äù he says with a sigh, as he opens the register for the female visitor to enter her details. I stare at him concerned and with a certain unease. Noticing the same, he tries to reconcile by saying ‚ÄúThe camera helps us catch miscreants‚Äù. I move towards the library not entirely convinced.",
      "In my anxious self to find my escape in books, I walk with a certain enthusiasm, almost feeling rejuvenated, to the library until I am stopped for my I-card at the entrance. I tell the SIS guard I do not have it, slightly annoyed that I still haven‚Äôt found my books. He asks me to enter my details and since the overhead camera wasn‚Äôt enough, I provide yet more information about me. The unease returns and I hurry towards the books.",
      "Later in the evening, I grab a coffee in CCD and with a certain ease, I leave the laptop on the center table knowing that the camera watches us and no one will steal it. In doing so, I trusted the camera more than the people and the realization turns my ease into unease. I am tempted to do something about it but where do I start, what can I possibly do? I leave for another wandering and I come back to find my laptop still at the place I left it in.",
      "I find a mango tree with ripe yellow delights hanging all over its branches, I try to pluck one only to be stopped by the SIS guard who has orders not to let anyone pluck and he informs me the same and further that any exceptions will not be made in the face of the camera watching us. I give up my desire to eat a mango with some reluctance but with the same old unease.In a disgruntled sigh and a certain nonchalance, I sit underneath that mango tree and rather than resisting the unease, I peer through the time spent in the campus looking for the same unease. I am reminded of the arbitrary closure of gate between GH1 and GH2, because apparently free movement between the above two halls is not okay but between hall 10 and hall 11, it is okay. I am reminded of the student evicted from the hall because he spoke to the warden like an equal.[4]I am reminded of the pointlessness of the confrontations with SIS guards when the ones yielding power sit in offices passing ordinances.

      "Although the sleeping habits of Bruce Wayne have always remained a mystery, one can very easily argue that The Caped Crusader had a delayed sleep phase condition. While Bruce stays out fighting crime, an average college student brews a cuppa, staying up late till the proverbial break of dawn. That‚Äôs what most college students in India and even across the world might relate to, where going to sleep at 2 AM or 3 AM is pretty common. Quite sadly, in the real world, not sleeping enough or sleeping late than usual might have some consequences. To pursue this issue, Vox recently conducted a comprehensive survey to track the sleep demographics of campus students and to cover the reasons behind the irregularities in sleep schedules. We amassed 782 responses, that comprised of 485 UG/Dual Degree students and 297 PG/PhDs. Given the differences in lifestyles of these 2 groups, the division helped us analyze the survey data more vividly.",
      "General Trends",
      "",
      "The average sleep time of students for the whole student population clusters around 5-7 hours per day (60%). 64.9% of PGs and PhDs get a sleep of 5-7 hours/day, as compared to 54.7% of the UG/Dual Degree population. Considering 7 to be the magic number of hours one should sleep for sound physiological and mental health, it turns out that 66.4% of UG and Dual degree students are not sleeping enough. PGs/PhDs are in a much worse situation, with 72.2% of their population sleeping below 7 hours a day. A considerable chunk of the total population (8.2%) is getting sleep of fewer than 5 hours a day, inviting dangerous repercussions on their mind and body.",
      "While not sleeping enough is a huge problem, if one is not sleepingearlyenough, they are highly likely to skip classes and miss breakfast. While the former deters academic performance, the latter can only make mornings more unproductive. Ideally, to get 7 hours of sleep, and to grab breakfast the other day (Assuming classes start at 8 AM), one should sleep at 12 am the latest. For this general case, a big portion falls out.",
      "Is IIT Kanpur to blame here?",
      "",
      "A good heuristic to answer the above would be to compare sleep schedules of students before and after joining the Institute. The results show a significant decrease of 6% in the number of people sleeping at least five hours a day. Interestingly the UG/Dual group is affected more adversely as compared to the PG/Ph.D group, with a decrease of 8% as compared to 3%. Notice that within this 5+ hours range of sleeping time, almost half the people navigated from the 7+ hour schedule to 5-7 hours of sleep, courtesy IIT Kanpur. Finally, the most important statistic here is the Transitional Probability, defined as the number of individuals who reduced their sleep time by 2 or more hours divided by the total number of individuals. Interestingly 98.2% moved across sleep schedules to cut down their sleeping time by 2 hours. This probability, when calculated for 4 or more hours, came out to be 63.8%.",
      "",
      "",
      "So what actually takes most of our sleep-time?",
      "Well, on average the whole student population spends most of the night time hanging out with friends, studying and watching movies/TV shows. In general bulla sessions are more prominent in the case of UG/Dual Degree population replaced by extensive workload and studies in PG/Ph.D. The point to ponder upon is that there belongs a considerable number in the population(12.9%) who agree that they spend time doing nothing. This is significantly more than the percentage of campus population spending time in clubs and fest related activities(10.8%).",
      "",
      "It is likely that these delayed sleep schedules can adversely affect other areas of life. So we also asked the student community about the aspect of their life that has been affected the most because of their irregular sleeping schedules. The distribution was almost equally divided into social and academic factors, showing that we are not doing any good to any of these spheres of life by not sleeping enough.",
      "Days of Sleep Depravity",
      "A chronic sleep-restricted state can cause fatigue, daytime sleepiness, clumsiness, irregular appetite, etc. It adversely affects the brain and cognitive function. In general, a considerable portion of the student community feels that there are 2-3 mornings/afternoons(36.3%) in a week and 4-6 mornings/afternoons (20.5%) when they feel have not slept enough. Among the possible consequences of sleep deprivation, deficits in attention and working memory are perhaps the most important and the student‚Äôs community faces this a lot in general from feeling sluggish every morning to not being able to perform efficiently to their fullest in day to day activities.",
      "[infogram id=‚Äùuntitled-infographic-1hxj48jrwjkq2vg?live‚Äù]",
      "",
      "The Exams",
      "A lot of things suddenly change when exams are around the corner, and as intuition would predict, these changes affect our sleep health too. To examine the magnitude of this problem we calculated the number of people in our two major sleeping time windows, and they were found to decrease to one-fourth and two-third of their original values respectively. Given that exams require students to stay in their best mental composure, clearly sleeping for less than 7 hours could prove to be detrimental. Recall that a major chunk also(about 50%) feels that academics have been affected negatively, due to their sleep schedules, so maybe burning the midnight oil right before exams is not that good an idea.",
      "",
      "Saving the best for the last, we asked students how they felt about their own sleeping schedules and if they thought could improve, and 57.43% of the population responded with a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, that they are not satisfied with their current clocks and would love to change it. A positive noteworthy point here is that if we can somehow shift our timelines by two or maybe three hours, we have almost solved the problem. But this involves a sharp change in times at which campus activities take place, which usually start after 9pm. Other factors like sleeping, hangout/bulla sessions or watching TV shows, can be shifted in a similar manner. These changes might seem too much for the existing batches, but freshers have a fresh start ahead of them, and with the right cooperation from people involved, we might just improve the situation slightly.",

      "I have stood by these lines as far as possible in the last four years while following my intuition. Right from the beginning, when I was almost forced by my peers and family to choose IITB, I chose IITK. Ever since I made that decision, I had promised myself that no matter what anyone around me said, I would do what my heart ached for me to do. Even if it was the most popular choice or the least, at the end of these adventurous four years, I can most definitely say, I couldn‚Äôt have been more grateful.",
      "I remember the lines a professor said not only in our class but also during our farewell: The funny thing about running the rat race is, no matter where you end up at the end of the race, be it the topmost or bottommost position, you will remain a rat. Not only is this statement funny but also most accurately describes the current state of affairs in our world. And I was following what my professor said long before I had even heard it. And that has made all the difference.",

      "I have not met a single person who did not go through a rough patch in their lives. Be it in their early childhood because of bullies, or in college because of academics or because of unrequited love üòõ No matter how hopeless the situation might seem to you, there is always someone who would believe in you and will be there to support you. I have seen people rise from their lowest to the top with a wide smile. I have seen these people go through several sessions with a counsellor to no avail only until they found their true calling when they came through. I was one of these people. It is not as important as what you do than it is why you do it. So no matter what you feel like doing if you have a strong why you will get through! More often than not, when people go through a bad patch in their lives, most of them are alone and don‚Äôt have a confidant to talk to about their sorrows and hardships.",
      "My life went on with many such highs and lows, I was without an intern even until the end of my sixth semester, I had three PORs and had worked hard for each one of them and those were my highest days working tirelessly for something much bigger than myself. I was sad, frustrated, angry, happy, ecstatic, carefree at different points in this three-year journey for a myriad of reasons. It was during Techkriti 2018 that I met a friend who gave me a book that talked about death and that was my introduction to the Bhakti Vedanta Club IITK.",
      "You may or may not have heard about BVC but allow me an introduction. So BVC IITK is a group of students who try and implement the ancient Vedic knowledge into their lives. The references for this knowledge is the holy Bhagavad Gita and Shrimad Bhagavatam. Although I am not a stringent follower of its principles, I can tell you about my experience. My final year was filled with many situations which would have involved me getting sad over or overthinking about all of it but also whatever I learned at BVC, it has given me a stability which I am most grateful for today and I am more stable and equipoised than I ever was. Spirituality is an essential part of our lives and most of us realise this towards the end of our lives. If you just go over YouTube and search for spiritual living, you will find so many different ways of meditation, spirituality etc. Not only are there so many different ways but also these have been existing for millennia now.",

      "Counselling and therapy might seem like a bad thing but coming from someone who has been through multiple such sessions, I can assure you that talking helps. Even if you don‚Äôt find a solution you want or like, talking to someone who has your best interests at heart will always help be it a few millennia ago when Lord Krishna counsels Arjuna on the battlefield or be it a few millennia in the future (if humanity is successful in restoring Earth that is üòõ ).",
      "There will always be a dream that you wish to fulfill but no matter how hard you try, you just wouldn‚Äôt get it. That was the internship season for me. Until the last day of the arrival of companies I was left with nothing. The company for which I thought I was fit, raised my expectations only to break them all due to unavailability of time. I was never a fan of the corporate culture, trying to profit some high ranked individual who doesn‚Äôt even know you. And yet here I was running the ‚Äúrat‚Äù race for a good internship. Had I obtained an intern position, I might have gotten trapped into thinking that this was how my life was supposed to be. I felt defeated; I was vulnerable; I felt I wasn‚Äôt good enough. And yet here I was asking a professor who taught me a course to find me an industrial intern. Although I was miserable for the most part through that intern, it made me realize my true calling. I decided to give the GRE and TOEFL and almost had myself convinced that higher education is necessary. Soon, I was applying to numerous universities, and unlike most of the population, I concentrated my efforts towards European Universities and rightly so, saved most of the financial burden on myself and my family.",

      "I had entered IITK in an era of rising CSE dominance in almost every field, be it placements, internships, research and yet in my 7th semester as I was glancing over the list of companies coming for placements, as lucrative as their packages seemed, I despised the thought of sitting in front of computer screens 40 hours per week. Although that is how I had passed so many of my courses at IITK, it didn‚Äôt seem like a feasible option for me considering the internship experience I had. I had set my eyes on only the core companies, and after a few unqualified tests, a couple lost interviews and rejecting one company during the interview, I landed a core Mechanical Engineering job. From almost believing that I wasn‚Äôt good enough to landing a job in a sector I genuinely wanted to work in, I finally connected the dots looking backward. Right then and there I realized through all the sad faces at the end of every placement day and hopeless interviews, everything falls into place for everyone. No matter how hard the going might get, I truly believe that the only person stopping us from reaching our highest potential is none other than ourselves.",
      "Back in my second semester, I met with an accident, and after a couple of hours of surgery and three weeks of missed classes, I had lost all hope and was considering dropping the semester. Although I found myself in a tough spot, every professor, friend, and wingmate was there to help me out. I got to know a lot many people even more closely than I ever knew them before. So even if one feels that there‚Äôs only bad in difficult times, trust me when I say that there‚Äôs always something to gain out of potentially bad experiences, be it out of accidents or be it through your mind playing tricks on you. I‚Äôve been through many such experiences in the last four years, and I am sure most of you will do too. I just want you to know that even if you find it difficult to find, there is always a silver lining to every crisis, an opportunity in every discomfort. A chance to grow. One of the best ones at that.",

      "Towards the later part of the second semester, I was assigned a task by the fourth year seniors of Hera Pheri Films. I was to talk to graduating students and ask them the message that they would like to give to themselves when they came in IITK as freshers. It was a weird experience for someone who was just in his second semester because even when I had seen all these chaapu seniors be bakait at what they did, here I was seeing them cry over reminiscing the last four years of their lives. Like many others, I had never thought I would be able to gather so many memories worth crying over at the end, but IITK has a way to make sure everyone has moist eyes while graduating. It began with a pressurizing orientation week in the first semester to an accident in the second. In third semester I¬† became an engineer in SAE and later got rejected the position of Assistant Coordinator in the Counselling Service in the fourth. A Goa trip in the winter break was a good start to become the Astronomy Club coordinator and later manage Ritambhara in the fifth semester. A kickstart for the sixth semester with a Haridwar trip to rigorous placement season in the seventh and ended with a nostalgic eighth semester, I guess IITK made me a human. A human who will never be afraid to follow his heart, who will never be afraid to care for others, who will never be afraid to make new friends, who will never be afraid to cry on his day of graduation.",

With one C and rest A‚Äôs on my grade sheet, I managed switching to Electrical, which, in hindsight, I feel so relieved about. My second goal only ceased to be a goal after years of procrastination when I finally received a pre-placement offer from Texas Instruments (which I later rejected to move on to management consulting). My days of relying on a coding job because of the dearth of core companies were over. As for the third goal, I nailed it!",

On a scale of Brandon Stark to Tyrion Lannister, you can choose to be anywhere at any time of your journey and you can happily survive. A senior of mine once pointed out: you could literally be locked up in your room for a week and then resurface to continue exactly where you left off; at no other point in life would you get such flexibility. As for me, I achieved my lifetime peak of social interaction in the first year, to an extent that mybehensonce quipped in the library, ‚ÄúMugdha ko har paanch minute mein ek insaan ‚ÄòHi‚Äô bol kar jaata hai!‚Äù A lot of people in the campus would not relate to this side of me but it meant a lot to me to be able to connect to people easily.

It was amusing to witness a crowd of over 30 boys, shouting on top of their voices, hooting to the tone of ‚Äúabey ladki se haarega kya!‚Äù. Table Tennis, however, soon became a constant part of my life on campus.",
      "I spent a considerable amount of time on the TT court and with the team. In my first year, I saw issues with the functioning of the team which I wanted to resolve. In my second and third year, I got to work on some of them as a captain. In practicing regularly, playing tournaments, going to trips, going to treats, planning farewells and bitching about you-guess-who, I spent the time of my life.

I took a lot of time to decide if I wanted to contest or not. I had great ambitions to work for the council, but elections and politics were not my fort√©. I ultimately decided to contest because I did not want to regret missing an opportunity later. However, it was too late and I horribly lost. I do not feel very remorseful about it for the experience was completely worth it. However, the year that followed was terrible.

As against a passive ‚Äúwhatever happens, happens for the best‚Äù mentality, I unintentionally came up with reasons that significantly helped me reconcile; and these were all sorts of reasons possible. When I could not score adouble dassato switch to CSE, I was happy because I realized that the effort the department demanded was huge and I, perhaps, did not even have the acumen for it. When the Counselling Service rejected me for Core Team Operations, I was happy when I learnt Sharmishtha Ma‚Äôam resigned because I¬† felt I was drawn to working with her. (Lame enough, I know!) When I couldn‚Äôt make it as an intern to ITC in the third year, I finally made peace with that when I saw they gave out PPOs very late (in October 2018) and I would have been an indecisive wreck by then had I been in that scenario.

However, this could be anything for you- your sport, your passion for dramatics, your love for dance, your involvement with an SnT club, or even your habit of reading books; just make sure this one aspect of you always excels.

      "IIT-K has given me crazy friends who are always ready to take my GPL for no reason. It gave me countless heartbreaks and yet good enough people to help me get over it. From DOTA to start-up, I explored myriad opportunities to discover about myself. I lived with the best chaps in the country. I ate with them, played with them, had fun with them and even sometimes, had shit with them. All of these are common in a student‚Äôs life at IIT-K. However, I want to share something unique that I experienced and changed my perspective during my stay.",
      "Before coming to IIT-K, I have always been told that IITs are known for their students. Indeed, the statement holds as alumni of IITs have proven their worth in various fields. But, this is just one side of the coin. Even in IIT-K, the underscored advice of that to maintain at least a decent level of interaction with seniors is skewed. To complete this advice, one needs to add ‚Äòfaculty‚Äô in addition to seniors. To prove it, let me tell you a couple of stories that made me realize that interaction with professors on a personal level is a requisite. Finally, I will end with a short excerpt to cover the senior-junior dynamics.",
      "The first story is of my seventh semester; it was the time of Diwali. Unfortunately, I was not able to go home because of the quizzes and project deadlines in the following week. But then I got an invitation to attend a Diwali party at Suchitra Ma‚Äôam‚Äôs house. Despite having my doubts, I accepted the invite. I had preconceptions like ‚ÄòNeither have I done any of her courses nor do I know her well enough to go to the party‚Äô. I convinced myself by saying that ‚ÄòThere is a first time for everything,‚Äô and hoping that I would not be kicked out from party soon enough, I went.",
      "Poor me, I had no idea that this gathering will be one of the best times I ever had. Once I reached, the professor broke the ice right away by introducing herself and all the other people present there. She even invited me to participate in a challenge where the person who finishes a full brick of ice-cream would get a prize. FYI- a block of ice-cream is around half a kilogram, and it was November. Crazy, right? I would never have imagined that I will get to do this at a faculty‚Äôs house. ¬†Amazingly, I was among the top three, competing with Ayush Mukherjee. After that, we had a long session of Dumb Charades and Pictionary. We later lit the sky-lanterns and flew it together. At that day, I was able to make a friend that was not a student of IIT-K. After the Diwali party, we had numerous gatherings and pizza parties at her place. During my graduate applications, Suchitra Ma‚Äôam helped me write my SOPs and personal statements. She has taken care of me during my emotional breakdowns and what not.",
      "Next semester I took her course, and then realized that she has a wonderful sense of humor. If she were not a professor, she would be a top-notch stand-up comedian. Even though she has a strict marking scheme, no one is angry with her. Isn‚Äôt it amazing? In IIT-K, surrounded by a majority of students, it is indeed remarkable to make a friend out of a faculty.",

      "The second story is of my masters project supervisor- Prof. Anand Jha. I found him to be the best faculty on campus. After the end of my summers working on the thesis, he gave me feedback. He gave me a choice of whether I would like to have a sugar-coated or a brutal feedback. I chose the brutal one. In that, he told me what I lack as a researcher, and the things I should work on. Also, he highlighted my strengths and told me that this masters project would be an attempt to shape my attitude towards my idea of Ph.D. His regular interactions, critique, and occasional humor changed my perspective significantly. From an aspiring theoretical physicist, he motivated me towards experimental physics. There are very few professors in your life that shape your mind in your adulthood when most of us think that we are almost impeccable. Anand sir tolerated my PJs, gave us many lab treats, and always kept the morale of the group high.",

When I was a junior, despite those shenanigans that SGs did in the orientation, I was pampered a lot by my seniors. In my first year, I was in the Fine Arts Club and Prayas. I remember all those stupid reasons we made to ask for treats from my seniors. In the first year, my birthday was celebrated by seniors from the batches of Y13, Y12, Y11, Y10, Y09. I had never imagined that I will be able to get so much love and importance from such good people. From my failures to my little successes, I was never alone.

Whenever I made plans for a movie or dinner outside campus, I preferred that some juniors join me. Then I realized how cranky I was, when my juniors asked me for treats for stupid reasons. I felt the nostalgia when I saw them all pumped up for their first PHY103 quiz and their long-faces after the quiz. Throughout the five years, IIT Kanpur has changed both in good and bad ways.

If that‚Äôs not understood, I‚Äôll NEED TO WORK on my sarcasm. ¬†As far as I can remember, my journey slices up neatly in 4 phases and trust me, I do not intend to bore you.",
      "Excited as I was to get into IIT, I was also disappointed with my rank and my branch(Civil Engineering). I had screwed up my JEE Adv and along with it, every expectation I had for myself. Like many others, I came with a hope to change my branch to MnC. Yeah! People knowing me might laugh at this, but it‚Äôs true. I still remember running away from the stage once during orientation, when called upon to sing and asking my parents to take me away: such was my homesickness. Soon our classes started. I remember sitting silently and anxiously in my first class in L-7- I was a little frightened, but, more shocked to see the batch of approximately 450 students sitting in this big lecture hall. It was after attending the first 4 classes that I decided to not attend any more lectures in my four years (for those who don‚Äôt know me, I fulfilled that promise). Like any other fresher I picked things from the typical ‚ÄúFreshers‚Äô starter pack‚Äù one by one- the habit of texting, planning on starting a startup without an idea, enthusiasm towards hall General Championship, and highly unproductive contagious bulla sessions all night long. During this phase Ayush Singh and Anurag Kumar were my best support to always keep me motivated. My first year went by in meeting people, showing little interest in academics and much more in bulla sessions. The results were rather sour than sweet. Average grades, no improvement in thoughts and not enough accomplishments, because as Yoda from Star Wars might say, ‚Äúmisguided, I was‚Äù.",
      "My second phase started with the lowest point in my journey. By then, I thought a good CPI would do everything (which ironically I did not have either). Influenced by the elite seniors, I always wondered what anybody could gain from working in the fests. And soon enough, I entered the race for the so called ‚ÄúPORs‚Äù. My first ever task was given to me by Utkarsh Pratap Singh(a senior, fondly referred to as UPS). Me being totally unorganised and inexperienced, I ended up botching it up. I called up 75 colleges for participation in Prodigy (which on contrary, happens to be an event for school kids). Soon, I observed that in this corporate establishment, the top tier(Core Team) assigns tasks to the senior management, who pass it down to the junior employees(Secretary), who in turn dump all the useless tasks to their interns (Volunteer). Each working for an incentive to climb higher or learn something, but in the process, gaining nothing but experience (except the top tier).",

While the club was really small when I started my tenure, as I leave the campus it has grown enormously. There are people now, constantly involved in the non-performing clubs and that gives me immense satisfaction. Parallely, I wanted to make my way into the Students‚Äô Gymkhana, the ‚Äúsupreme‚Äù students‚Äô body, that controls all the councils. Enchanted by the power, without any existing knowledge of its workings, I became a senator. I went to every meeting initially, listening to every issue that was being addressed and putting up my suggestions on the desk. But, I saw no significant work being done. So I started missing the meetings, as a result of which I lost my seat in the senate.

There is an evident lack of professionalism, no matter how small the task; A lack of leadership which fails to create interest in the so called ‚Äúfraudies‚Äù. People often fail in academics, cause they never question their uncanny need for validation, even while having backlogs. They end up resorting to flattery and become a part of societal nepotism, through which one might end up succeeding for a while, but, ends up failing in the long run. All this because we keep forgetting the fact that though seniors are our guardians, we must question their suggestions and argue their logic. We must learn from them but choose what we learn, we must fight for the rights in any organisation(rather than criticising it). We must help them, even if it‚Äôs a small task, and respect them in our own rational way.",
      "I started to notice hierarchy in some clubs over others, it seemed to me that people from certain clubs were always leading the council. Unfortunately, the public had the same opinion, irrespective of the candidate. The ideology was that members of the clubs which remained active in politics are often not worthy of the position. I decided to fight against this, the war was first fought in my mind and later, in elections. In the early stages, I had no clue whether the fight was a righteous one or just to satisfy my ego. So, I started a propaganda to characterise people who disliked that club (which I‚Äôm saving for when I apply for BJP IT cell).",
      "I was now meeting people, understanding their problems, removing my initial biases and preparing the manifesto all along. During the course of my preparation, I identified some core problems in the council, such as lack of discipline and professionalism in clubs, and a lack of PG participation. The saddest part of all this was listening to the issues PGs face, all the while knowing deep inside that I can‚Äôt change a darn thing. The horrors of extension of a 5-6 year PhD to an 8-9 Year struggle were a living nightmare. While their pockets grew small, and their funding took a cut, a pack of Marlboro advanced turned into a couple of Wave cigarettes; a wing into a solitary room. As depression surrounded them, this place stayed still over the years.",
      "Megha was the first person to stand beside me, and was the one to give words to my ideas. Oh! I can‚Äôt forget my Hall-3 bachcha‚Äôs core team, they were my strongest pillars. After 4 months of rigorous election work, the results came, and Yes, I lost by 4 votes! I still don‚Äôt buy stuff in multiples of 4. What started with 2 people turned into a crowd of 60 people standing beside me, and I managed to amass a vote bank of 1225. Immediately after losing, I thought to myself whether I managed to fight this corrupt election process, and was very much satisfied to find that my vision is now a perception widely accepted in campus. My vision to make people from strong background realise that they must win as an individual, and to know that only hard work and political game counts.",

      "I still remember those days of ‚Äúberojgari‚Äù post elections, when going to MT in the morning was the most productive thing I managed. Then came an opportunity to work in Antaragni, and in time I became one of the proud members of a 21 people squad; setting aside our differences and aligned towards a common target, ‚Äúgiving IITK the best 4 days of their lives, without any deficit‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to choose filmmaking and work for myself or again selflessly work for an established organisation. Only to realise in the end that my top priority was to stay busy to keep the campus from engulfing me in sadness. Thanking the previous team for entrusting this opportunity in me, I started my tenure. We worked hard each day, living side by side, always having a topic to discuss with juniors. Amidst all the common fest related criticism, we kept working. We didn‚Äôt care. There was a point where we didn‚Äôt even know where our careers were going, having safe in the knowledge that we had each other‚Äôs backs.",
      "Come the placement season, luckily, I was shortlisted for few good companies by the virtue of my resume, and 2-3 tests I took. While people were getting placed, and I felt happy for them; I was surprised by how SPO stock market is governed. Yes, you read it right-exactly like a stock market! Imagine yourself being a stock share defined by your parent company‚Äôs (your resume) market demand. The companies coming for placements then, would be shareholders listed in the IPO (or your placement portal). While you are the kind of share that respects loyalty and wants to stay with your initial shareholder (the company you target); yet, you have to adjust according to the market everyday. The demand may go up or down, each time your company profile updates. Amidst all the fast paced, unpredictable fluctuations, many civil engineers become analysts, consultants become data scientists, analysts become product managers, product managers become operation engineers, and some clueless souls slide a resume, wondering if walk-in interviews are still happening. Well, who‚Äôs at fault? Maybe it‚Äôs us, for not planning our careers in advance and not building our profiles accordingly. Maybe it‚Äôs the companies, in which we apply indiscriminately which ends up increasing their workload and reinforcing a casual attitude, often missing out good profiles. Maybe it‚Äôs the system, which should have explained the work accounts to companies beforehand, so that there are less forged resumes and more honest ones. But, at the end of the day, everyone walks out more or less satisfied and maybe things will remain the same in the future. The last line is also indicative of how it works in the campus, ‚Äúand as I walk out more or less satisfied, I think the state of affairs might just remain the same.‚Äù",
      "While we sit, and wait for our semesters to end; we often indulge ourselves in pointless activities to keep our lives from falling apart. Otherwise, the environment just becomes repetitive and boring. One such activity is to revisit your hall for one last Galaxy. Well, I was a hall 3 resident, need I say more? But, as one of the overall coordinators of Galaxy and a prominent member of the hall, I have witnessed its slow and painful demise. The unwillingness of 1st yearites to participate results in a lack of interest to organise in the 2nd yearites. Only a few are involved, and as a result they have to participate in multiple events. It is organised only by the seniors and HEC‚Äôs who have been involved in it previously, and care about hall culture. Sadly, this model won‚Äôt last long until changes are made (i.e e-rickshaws from hall 13 to respective halls). I remember the time when the sole purpose of Galaxy was to create an interaction space between juniors, seniors and the clubs, and to witness the majestic parades of 150 people coming together from each hall.",
      "Being a godfather to a few candidates this time (just like Kshitij Yadav was mine), I‚Äôve now seen elections from inside out, and from every stakeholder‚Äôs perspective. Well, we have a vote division based on caste, religion (or our hall residency) much like in the Indian political system. Then we have a body acting both as an investigative and judiciary committee (GRC), a set of bureaucrats who directly/Indirectly influence the election (HEC, Senators, Executives), candidates lobbying with each other, exchanging each other‚Äôs territory votes and a team called EC trying their best to avoid any bias or malpractices. And not to forget set of written rules which seem like a joke; hardly ever discussed or worked upon over time. But, thank god we don‚Äôt have a multi-party election system like DU, right? Many candidates each year work hard for 6 months, waste their time and money for people supporting them. They still end up losing their candidature either by the administration or in some kind of politics; later to to be labeled as unethical. Why should one not lobby with other candidates, or not involve bureaucrats, or not view PGs as a mere vote bank, or not make fake promises, cause maybe, you‚Äôll end up sitting and waiting while your opponent is doing the same. How could you know? Can you just assume the precedence that both the candidates will end up fair? In this utopian society, if both the candidates play fair, then we‚Äôll have a total voting of just 15-20%. The candidates might not be a popular choice, but Hey!, at least everything is legal and free of forced participation, and THAT is the best for Gymkhana. I see a lot of people in Gymkhana with a visionary approach, working hard every year to make it a true representative of our students. Many of us are unaware of the fact that each day, each cell, fest and student body are in a way dealing with administration while our administration(except few people) are crushing us. Even among all this, there are still people who view it as a playground to pull each others legs out, and satisfy their own ego in an unproductive manner. My advice to them will be to start appreciating others, and unite the living for our true war in the North(dealing with administration) and not among ourselves .",
      "Well throughout my 4 years I always had a core group of people who always supported me and I was always loyal to them , well the list is long and it would not be good if I miss even a single name but I would like to thank them to make my campus life bearable and everyone‚Äôs unbearable. The one person who I would like to acknowledge and without whom I would have been just a GC enthusiast who supported me helped me never questioned my rationality and stayed dank af- Megha Anotra. She always supported me as if it was her work whether election or me going through anxiety or through the placement or showing me the practical side of the coin. As one junior rightly said",

      "I wanted to clarify(from Vox peeps) whether this is an autobiographical piece or one where I get to talk to the reader. I was told it is my choice; I will lean towards the latter. ¬†The reason being that there‚Äôs nothing much I can say about myself which people, in general, would find relevant. The struggle we face upon leaving home is not unique to me, and hence it is better to share what I feel than what I went through.",
      "",
      "It has been more than a month since I started writing this article. I have wiped off three completely different drafts before writing this one. I will take you through the journey of writing this article itself. I chose this format because it is truly representative of my campus life during the past 4 years, it has all been about making mistakes, going through a low and then coming out of it learning something new. The first draft that I wrote, I wanted to talk about issues- issues which I felt the campus community is apathetic towards. I even made a list out of them. But then I realised that there‚Äôs no point giving any fundae. The article was good, but it lacked a ‚Äòcentral theme‚Äô. I wanted to write something better, something meta. Hence came the second draft, trying to make the reader realise that most of what we do is based on the influence of the people we live with, and there is little or no conscious thought involved in a majority of our decisions. This was better, some of it did manage to survive till the final draft(which you will read later). I finally realised that although it was good, it was artificially constructed in order to come up with something good, something which the reader finds interesting to read.",
      "",
      "The past week stands out in terms of self-introspection. Being idle is not really my thing, and hence when I got some completely free time after months, I started to revisit whatever I had done in the campus in the past 4 years. Now that I look back at the past week, it was a downward spiral of negativity which I went into, but it helped me realise a lot of things. The third and final draft was written during this phase. It was an extremely self-admonishing piece which enlisted things which I thought I could have done better in the college, from counselling service to interaction with wingmates, to how I behaved with my friends. In the end, I had decided that owing to the number of mistakes I had committed, the only way in which I could possibly write an article was to pose as the recovered addict who would advise the general populace why not consume harmful substances. I shared it with a few people, only to be chided about the extremes to which I went. Around the same time, I got a few messages from juniors who told me how they felt that I had had an impact on their lives on the campus. I realised that in spite of all the ‚Äòhagaps‚Äô, and ‚Äòthings not done‚Äô, people had managed to extract some positivity. I also realised that it is important to appreciate what one has done, along with pondering upon what he/she could do. And that it is important to forgive oneself, to be able to focus on the coming days. More so, if things are no longer in your hand.",
      "I was back at square one, trying to find something relevant. I decided that there is no point in writing an article for the sake of it, and hence there wouldn‚Äôt be any. I informed the Vox people about it. I had realised that during most of our conversations, what we present is a morphed image of ourselves, based on our ideal images of self, or what will be best liked by others, i.e. our ought self. I did not want to do that in this piece. So if there were to be an article, it should be what I feel, and not what I want others to feel about me. I strongly felt that the article itself had been a learning experience, and what I‚Äôve learnt here is something I should share with everyone. And as a result, I have been told that this seems to be more of ‚ÄòAs we weave ‚Äúas we leave‚Äù ‚Äô than ‚Äòas we leave‚Äô.",
      "",
      "So for this time[on Vox], and possibly the last(on campus), let me be completely honest with you. Let me not talk about issues taking a moral high, when I myself have done nothing to better the situation. Let me be against the ‚Äòevils‚Äô while recognising that ‚Äòbeing against them‚Äô is not the final step. Let me admit that although I talk about being against ragging, I myself enjoyed some parts of it during my first year and did not speak up against it on various occasions in my second. Let me share my insecurities, let me be honest. When I ask people to not celebrate success in a way which makes others feel bad, I myself have learnt it by making others feel bad, and hence there is no point making a this vs that, supporter vs opposer, or CS vs Gymkhana divide on every issue. The issue arises when you want to portray to others or yourself that you lie on one of the other extremes. I will avoid doing that here. I will not create more binaries, only to leave you with the dilemma of having to choose one of them, because anAs We Leavewritten by a (half +ùùê) student is very different from (one ‚Äì ùùê), both being one in the binary view.",
      "The only binary which stays strong is that you need to respect the basic rights of everyone(including yourself). Other than that, there is a level of subjectivity to almost everything you‚Äôll come across. The problem with creating dichotomies is that it creates boundaries, which are difficult to conquer. My first galaxy event was in my last semester, I‚Äôm lucky I actually had one, there are so many opportunities which I missed due to negligence. Having preconceived notions about courses/ professors/ clubs/ students bodies on the campus will only help you justify why you are not working as hard as you could. Although you are free to take your decisions, this liberty is futile if you are not well-informed. Don‚Äôt let the crowd around you decide what courses you do, or which classes you attend(if any), or what clubs you work in. Know yourself well to realise which habits you would want to retain, and what new ones you need to learn. In short, you should try to be in control of your life in the truest sense.",
      "You should either be in full control of your life or be in the company of people who you think would have a positive influence on you. If I look back at the schedule I followed, or rather the absence of one, or the efforts I had put in, I have managed to end up better than what I deserved to be. A lot of it can be attributed to constant support from my family and friends- friends who provided honest feedback constantly. The campus life is such a subjective experience that you cannot look up to a senior and repeat what he did to obtain similar results. Instead, one needs to go meta and look at the processes people use to keep themselves organised and self-aware. Go out, take a few steps based on whatever you know, falter, and then back propagate your errors to see what went wrong.",
      "",
      "In spite of all the regrets, if I look back at the person who came into this campus 4 years ago, I think I am really grateful for what I have today. I have a few really great friends, I managed to maintain a pretty good academic record on the campus. I have learnt a lot from faculty members, and I am sure that I will stay in touch with most of them even after I leave. Although I could not do justice to the positions I held, I was lucky to have worked with a number of student bodies on the campus, counselling service being the best among those. However, I am really glad that none of it came at the cost of my academics or relations with my family. Academics will always remain the ‚Äònecessary but not sufficient‚Äô 1 which you need, in order to give true value to your ‚Äò0‚Äôs, which are the other involvements in the campus. ¬†If you think that you can manage your academics well, you should definitely volunteer for the student bodies on the campus that interest you. More than anything, this will definitely serve as a unique part of your campus experience and you‚Äôll end up learning something new.",
      "Having talked to a number of seniors, I feel that the biggest change we will probably witness is that our lives will never be as vibrant in the future. I‚Äôve heard this from students, seniors and professors. The campus is largely a utopia, an incubation centre with very little risks involved as compared to the outside world. The campus allows you to have a different point of view, to tread along the road not taken and be whatever you want. It lets you be free of the multiple identities given to you by the outside world, and think like a human above anything else. Such liberty would naturally lead to a lot of diversity, which we observe, but not everywhere. I myself am a part of the herd in many ways. I would not tell you what to do specifically, but I will repeat the age-old advice of not sitting back in your room and exploring the campus, which is there to stay relevant forever, sadly.",
      "",
      "The things that I will remember the most is the night outs we pulled-off at the CS Office while planning the orientation, the discussions with friends while looking at the stars in OAT, eating rolls at 3, a change of fortune during the last minute of an event during Techkriti, the painfully long meetings with professors which I hope had some impact on student lives. How can I forget the Sikkim trip! Had this been an autobiographical piece, I would have talked about my friends from EE, counselling service, my wing-mates, my bachchas. But I guess, a lot more has been said during the silent stares while waiting for their taxis to arrive. A lot more was heard in the eerie silence when no one spoke while roaming around the campus during the last days. I promised to be honest, and hence I will end this by extending apologies and gratitude to all of them!",

      "Coming to IITK, I felt that if we work hard towards our goals, the sky‚Äôs the limit, This concept was ingrained on me even further as I could easily apply it to anything that I had done at that point. At least that was the message that I had learned from my stay in Kota.",
      "All of that changes in IITK. I had a *baapu* with hair flowing by the neck, telling me one thing, the professors preaching something and parents the other. There was no unison in life, no shining lighthouse to guide the way and life became not as simple as solving problems and giving exams.",
      "Over my time, I realized that I had faced it not once but many times and will probably face in the future too, so I call it *not having a f***ing clue what to do in my life*. And it is just that, sometimes there will be only two choices, while some time so many. It comes in forms like, not knowing to continue in a project or leave it? Whether to take extra courses or not? Sit in the internship season or go for a research intern, ¬†Job, Research, MBA, Ph.D., start-up? In fact, in my experience, most of us procrastinate and address these questions right before deadlines (as always üòâ ), rushing on them and picking whatever everyone says or *the famous path of least resistance*. At least this was the case with me. In my first semester, I was spent almost all my time with just getting on with academics without looking for what even lied beyond my room. Hell, I ran away to RM or CC at times to get away from all that.",
      "It sure helped me with my grades but at the cost of not being able to even exploring my interests and getting to know the awesome people on campus. The lesson that I have learned here is that, to break the deadlock, we need to understand what we want to optimize in life? Is it happiness, is its impact, is it money or something else all-together and then choose where to devote time.

At the time, I tried to be camouflage in the crowd so that seniors around, forget about me (just like Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet.GOT Reference). I closed off my mind to all the advice being thrown around and being a shy individual; I was similarly hesitant to talk with the diverse set of batch-mates as well. This was where I later realized that I was losing out! I judged people from their face value and the worst of them. But humans are not made to be binary. In fact several of the best people I know have been people, I would have never talked if I had stayed the same.",

And without them, it would be no better than a private institute run by babus. The diversity here is unmatched, with people from different parts of the nation, different walks of life, different personalities and views. All clubbed together in an institution that is open to anyone expressing themselves without fear.",
      "Amongst all the people that we meet on campus, we all have a Gang that we belong to, the closest set of friends that we have on campus.

The stress of doing good in assignments, exams; the stress of finding an intern, job; the stress of finishing off projects and most importantly the stress to fail. Stress can be a good thing if it is under control but can be a killer otherwise (pun intended). Here, we need to take a step back and look at life before IIT and after it. These are two distinct realities, before joining IITs is a period without responsibilities in most part; on the other hand, freedom is limited. After IITs, as we become adults and there is freedom to do anything but responsibilities too that we need to address.",

Just do something!",
      "These four years of IITK have taught me much more about everything than what I knew before, while also being one hell of a rollercoaster ride throughout. It was an enigma to me before why college life is so hyped, but it has stood up and above all my expectations. The 1AM canteen bullas, the pre-assignments night outs, the gang trips, the morning PE, thesuit-boot meinattending ppts, the late-late night strolls, the movie and football nights, the awesome concerts, the mess food, the subsidized CCD, the wing sharing of hand wash to cycle, the treats, and on and on and on.Ye fakiri waale din hamesha yaad rahenge!",

Getting through those late night bulla sessions and trying to stay awake till the next day for early morning lectures and a lot more- just a part of a never-ending list. It was not long before I came to this campus that I found myself with absolutely no idea of what I would do with my life. I remember an incident from my orientation days when I realised the grave mistake I had made after seeing the expressions of a senior whom I had called ‚Äòbhaiya‚Äô.

      "I have walked down a long path from living a comfortable life of doing nothing at home to doing everything on my own. Trying to spot a girl to sit with me during my first semester to attending most of the classes in my last year was as difficult as finding a female batchmate in Civil Engineering. Initially, I didn‚Äôt know much about civil engineering, but for some reason during counselling, I had filled all my choices to be Civil in different IITs. It‚Äôs an era of rapid technological development where everyone wants to pursue their degrees in computer science, and it‚Äôs not common for students to like their stream they get through counselling, but call it luck or something else, I really liked what I got. I started studying these courses, not for the sake of grades but to gain knowledge and to make the most out of the opportunities given by this institution. Attending classes and tutorials helped me and I could see a lot of improvement in myself. Of course, maintaining that kind of discipline for an entire semester isn‚Äôt easy and there were times when I got frustrated, but my friends helped me a lot. With time, I began to develop an interest in structural mechanics.",

      "Working as a Senior Executive of Techkriti in my second year was one of the best decisions I ever made. It pulled me out of my shell, helped me gain confidence as well manage my time. I have met some awesome people in these four years, who‚Äôve become just like family to me and leaving this campus is definitely not the end with them. When I look back at this time, I realize that the present version of me is a lot more mature, confident and sorted about what to do with my life. Somehow, this experience of transformation reminds me of a line I read somewhere- ‚Äò‚ÄôA wise woman is made of ideas and not of atoms.‚Äô‚Äô",
      "The third year was full of surprises- so many courses, labs and of course, the most difficult of all- lab reports. You all might have seen people around the academic area trying to figure out something using a yellow ‚Äò‚Äôcamera‚Äô‚Äô. People used to ask us what we did with that. Well, it‚Äôs not a camera. It‚Äôs an instrument used to measure angles, distances and is certainly one of my favorite lab courses. Besides doing the courses, I had to look for an internship too just like other students. But, getting a core internship in good companies is tougher than getting placed. SPO asked for a master resume and a one page resume but I did not have much to write in either of these. I spent my time at home studying the departmental courses in order to make my concepts clear.",
      "People around me were not sure of why I was registering for the placements if I was not ready to work for the non core sector, but I had those one or two core companies in mind, for the interviews of which I always wanted to appear. I finally got the chance. It was a test of all I had studied these years and I finally got selected. ‚ÄúWhy did you choose civil engineering and why do you want to join the core sector?‚Äù was the first question of that 45 minutes long interview. I was not expecting this question as it was supposed to be a technical interview, but I did not need a prepared answer for it. I spoke clearly what was on my mind all these years. I was always sure of not following the herd if I was not interested. I might have started from the bottom but the graph of learning and improving was an increasing one constantly and that‚Äôs all that matters.",

      "As I leave, I‚Äôd want to say that IITK alone gives you umpteen opportunities to explore. Be eager to learn and do what you like, because this kind of opportunity doesn‚Äôt come back again. This life is yours, so the choice should be yours too. There will be hard times, you may make mistakes, but all you need is a bit of patience and your will to keep going. Life is a long journey with problems to solve, lessons to learn, but most of all experiences to enjoy. Cheers!",
