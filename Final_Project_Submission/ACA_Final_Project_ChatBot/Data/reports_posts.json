      "On February 19, 2025, the Council of Students for Hostel Affairs (CoSHA) held its second emergency meeting in the Senate Hall to discuss the recent eviction notice served to the Dhobis, whose deadline to vacate was set for March 6. This meeting was attended by Hall Presidents, Gymkhana representatives and a number of GBMs.",
      "According to the published minutes, “The central theme of the discussion was that the students, being the majority stakeholders of the service, were never consulted before the eviction notices were served to the Dhobis.”",
      "The institute’s long-term modernization plan was a topic of discussion. The Director’s proposal (as reported previously), which involved establishing a central laundromat with industrial-grade washing machines operated by the Dhobis, was unanimously opposed. As recorded in the minutes, “As part of a long-term modernization plan, the institute wanted to eventually set up a central laundromat with industrial grade washing machines operated by the dhobis themselves. The CoSHA, representative of the student body, was unanimous in its disagreement with the same, citing reasons of hygiene, convenience and concerns of privatization.”",
      "The basis for the eviction was another focal point. The notice deemed Dhobi Ghat unsafe for residence based on two reports—from the Structural Engineering Laboratory of IIT Kanpur and the Department of Civil Engineering at HBTU. The minutes note, “It was noted that neither of the two reports were made available to the GBM to see and…  stated that despite emails sent to 9 professors concerned with the above two bodies by Vox Populi, six of them failed to acknowledge the existence of the reports and three did not reply. The Chairperson, CoSHA then confirmed that he and the Chairperson, Students’ Senate had seen the report from the HBTU but not the other report.”",
      "On the idea of using hall-14 for the storage of clothes, the minutes state, “The CoSHA agreed that rooms in Hall 14 would never be an option as firstly the sparse quantity was not enough for the Dhobis to carry out daily work and secondly as student intake will increase over the years the Dhobis would gradually be forced out again.”",
      "Concerns were also raised about the manner in which the eviction notices were served. One entry in the minutes reads, “It was pointed out that despite the institute acknowledging its humanitarian obligation towards the Dhobis, they were always threatened with ultimatums, police threats, and a large swath of security guards always accompanying the people serving the notices. They were also told that bulldozers would be used if they did not vacate.”",
      "Lastly, a discrepancy in official communications was discussed saying that “GBMs present in the meeting pointed out a major incident where an English version of a letter given by the institute directly contradicted the Hindi version and how the legal authorities would only consider the English version in case of any discrepancy. This contradiction in the notices was dismissed as ‘a typo’ by the institute.”",
      "The CoSHA, in its meeting on the 19th of February, 2025, keeping the best interest of the students in retaining the washerman services, decided unanimously the following courses of action henceforth.",
      "(i) A two way GBM between the dhobis and students where they could discuss the student stance adopted in this meeting.",
      "(ii) A three way Open House between the Dhobis (Service givers), Students (Service receivers) and the Director must be held before their eviction on the 6th of March, 2025.",
      "(iii) The students would not accept any alternative for the dhobi services in the near future, and the student representatives would present a stance of dissent against automation in this regard.",
      "(iv) The students, as the receivers of the service, would not accept the institute administration acting without listening to their stance on the matter.",
      "The CoSHA and its members present the following points to the administration after consultation with the Dhobis in the two way GBM:",
      "The next day, student representatives met with the Dhobis to confirm their support for the demands outlined in the CoSHA meeting, which the Dhobis affirmed. Later that evening, hall presidents and the PSG Chair met with the Director to discuss the proceedings",
      "According to a Gymkhana representative present at the meeting, the Director rejected the students’ opposition to mechanization and reaffirmed that modernization was essential for sustainability. Students also maintained that Hall 14 was not a viable storage space for the Dhobis. One of the Hall Presidents suggested setting up of tin sheds for storage of clothes, as the existing godowns had been declared structurally unsafe in the reports. Currently, sixteen six-foot-by-six-foot tin shed structures have been erected at one end of Dhobi Ghat.",
      "Tin Sheds erected at one end of Dhobi Ghat",
      "On March 4, student representatives, professors, and several GBMs gathered at Dhobi Ghat to discuss the evolving situation. The meeting concluded with three unanimously agreed points –",
      "In addition to these demands, those present at the meeting demanded that the Senate convene an emergency meeting to pass a resolution on the issue. Gymkhana representatives acknowledged the existence of this channel, but also added that the proceedings of CoSHA themselves serve as a strong expression of student opinion and demands.",
      "The following day (5th March), President, Students Gymkhana informed the senate via mail that  “the Director has officially confirmed the postponement of the Dhobis’ eviction deadline until a proper dialogue between the administrators and Dhobis is held, in the presence of the Director and students upon his return to campus.”",
      "On March 8, 2025, a meeting was convened in the Faculty Building to address the ongoing Dhobi issue. In contrast to earlier demands for an open house session, the meeting was open to Dhobis and 4 Gymkhana representatives only. Senior officials including the Director, Deputy Director, DoSA, DoAd, and the Registrar were also present. We spoke to a gymkhana representative to understand what was discussed in the meeting.",
      "Key points included:",
      "In summary, the three key demands outlined in the CoSHA meeting—",
      "Werenotaccepted by the Director and other officials.",
      "Neither the student representatives nor the Dhobi community agreed to the proposals presented at the meeting. Both groups confirmed that further internal discussions are needed before reaching any final decision.",
      "The Director concluded by agreeing to send an official email to the campus community by the following day. The email is expected to detail the complete history of the issue, outline the current situation, and present the administration’s future plans, thereby ensuring transparency and addressing any communication gaps. As of today, students have not received  this mail by the Director.",
      "On March 9th, four cameras had been installed at Dhobhighat—three near the drying sites and one at the entrance. With no toilet facilities available, Dhobis are forced to use open spaces for defecation and have objected to the camera placements, arguing that these installations restrict the areas they rely on for this basic need.",
      "Until further updates, thedemolition is set to begin tomorrow."

      "On January 3, 2025, the dhobis received their third eviction notice (each of the  dhobhis received it separately), requiring them to appear before the Institute authority on Monday, January 20 under the Eviction Act of 1971. The notice, signed by the Estate Officer, stated that occupying the Type IA quarters, stores, and other structures at the dhobighat was illegal, and it accused them of engaging in unauthorized commercial activity. As mandated by law, they were asked to present their case on the designated date. After the meeting on January 20, the institute issued a public notice on the issue. We spoke with the dhobis to learn more about their perspective.",
      "The notice is premised on the claim that –“After examination of the documents produced before the undersigned, Estate Officer, of opinion that the opposite party is in unauthorized occupation of the scheduled premises.”",
      "The dhobis contest this claim, saying that their occupation of the premises is legally recognized and historically documented. They cite official allotment letters (refer to website) issued by the Estate Office, which they claim formalized their residence and workspaces in Type IA houses, storage facilities (godowns), and designated washing tanks (haudas) at the dhobighat. According to them, these allotments, dating back to the 1960s and continuing until at least 2002, contain no specified expiration date, hence their argument that their tenure was intended to be long-term.",
      "They further argue that their occupancy has been acknowledged through consistent financial transactions with the Institute. Since 1989, they have been making regular payments for rent, water, and electricity, which they state were officially recorded and processed. As proof, they present payment receipts and utility bills, the most recent of which date to January 2020. They argue that these transactions demonstrate institutional recognition of their legal occupancy over the years.",
      "In addition to these financial records, the dhobis point to official government-issued documentation linking them to Dhobighat. They note that their Aadhar cards list Dhobighat as their registered residential address—an inclusion they argue would not have been possible without valid proof of residence.",
      "For some Dhobis, the notice says that – “The opposite party did not submit any document supporting any authority/allotment in his favour for occupation of the instant scheduled premises”",
      "The dhobis state that they formally drafted a response letter and allocation documents outlining their objections to the eviction notice. According to them, they attempted to deliver the letter and Documents  in person to the Estate Office during the 20th January hearing, but officials refused to accept it. In response, they sent the letter via speed post, attaching copies of their supporting documents, including allotment letters, payment records, and identification proofs. However, they report that the Estate Office did not acknowledge receiving these documents.",
      "Response Letter by the Dhobis",
      "In particular, they claim that photocopies of key documents were dismissed, though no explanation was provided for their rejection. An order sheet issued on January 28 stated that “the opposite party presented xerox copies of letter number.…. in support of occupancy of said house. The veracity of these letters cannot be ascertained due to not being in original form”. The dhobis state that since they had to submit these proofs via speed post, it was not feasible for them to attach the original documents.",
      "The notice claims, among other things that –“The opposite party admitted that he has been occupying in the house no. 39A of Type-I without any authority in his name..”",
      "The dhobis refute this claim, calling it a fabrication. They tell us at no point did they acknowledge their occupation as unlawful and argue that this statement misrepresents their position.",
      "Efforts to seek clarification from the Estate office regarding the recent eviction notice for Dhobighat workers yielded no response. However, the President, Students’ Gymkhana informed Vox that the Institute Director was open to providing a statement",
      "According to the Director, the primary reason for the eviction is the structural instability of the Dhobighat buildings rather than the validity of the workers’ allotment letters. Additionally, he emphasized the Institute’s sustainability goals, noting that per capita water consumption on campus is three times higher than the standard, with unmonitored water wastage at Dhobighat.",
      "To address these concerns, the Institute plans to introduce a centralized, industrial-grade laundry system, which is expected to improve efficiency (Faster Washing Cycles) and reduce water consumption. Until the new system is operational, the existing water tanks at Dhobighat will not be demolished. The affected workers will be provided temporary storage space for clothes at Hall 14 and offered employment within the new mechanized system.",
      "The Director also  stated that the workers would be eligible for housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and help from the institute, with alumni offering interim rental support until permanent housing is secured through the scheme.",
      "The dhobis, in their response, outline their position in the response letter (translated from Hindi) as an issue centered around livelihood instead of residence –",
      "“If the Institute requires the dhobighat site for some other purpose, the Institute needs to provide us with appropriate alternate arrangements and relocate our workplace somewhere else on campus premises. Our work requires the following:",
      "And given the nature of our work, we (our family) need access to our workplace throughout the day. If the above conditions are met, we are ready to leave our current workplace and place of residence. But we are shocked that even after 6 decades of our sincere service, the Institute, instead of initiating a constructive dialogue with us about possible relocation, has served us with eviction notices. To end, we only wish to carry on our services to the community in an undisrupted manner and earn our livelihood in the process. This work is the primary source of income for my family”",
      "As of now, the final ruling orders the dhobis and their families to vacate the premises within 30 days (6th March). The verdict further states that if they “refuse or fail to comply,” they will be “liable to be evicted…, if need be, by the use of such force as may be necessary.”",
      "This report covers events as of 19th February, 2025. Further developments on the issue include a CoSHA meeting and discussions of student representatives and Hall Presidents with the director. Vox is awaiting the official release of the meeting minutes and will publish an update once they are available.",

      "The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is an initiative by the Government of India to evaluate and rank higher education institutions based on comprehensive criteria. Introduced in 2015 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), now known as the Ministry of Education, it provides students, parents, and policymakers with valuable insights into institutional performance by assessing parameters liketeaching, research, employability, and infrastructure.Additionally, NIRF encourages a culture of excellence and innovation, aligns Indian institutions with global standards, and serves as a strategic tool for resource allocation and policy formulation in higher education.",
      "The NIRF rankings for 2024 are released across16 categories.IIT Kanpur participated in five of these categories:Overall,Engineering,Research,Innovation, andManagement.While it secured notable rankings such as 4th in Engineering, 5th Overall, and 7th in Research, there was anotable dropin theInnovation categoryfrom 1st in 2023 to 5th in 2024. InManagement, IIT Kanpur ranked 29th, reflecting its newer and evolving management programs​. This article delves deeper into the performance factors and the reasons behind this shift in ranking.",
      "Disclaimer:For the overall section of the NIRF rankings, we initially interviewed the then DOAA, Prof. Shalabh. However, upon reviewing the draft for verification, he requested that his comments not be published, as his tenure was about to end and advised us to seek the same information from the new DOAA. We then reached out to the new DOAA, Prof. Ashoke De, who redirected us to the Institute’s ranking cell, which operates under the Deputy Director, Prof. Braj Bhushan. Subsequently, we contacted the ranking cell but have not yet received a response.",
      "The Overall category in the NIRF rankings provides a comprehensive assessment of higher education institutions, evaluating their performance across multiple disciplines and functions. It focuses on factors like teaching quality, research output, graduation outcomes, inclusivity, and perception, offering a broad perspective on an institution’s overall excellence.",
      "Our analysis of NIRF reports shows that IIT Kanpur is the only top-five IIT withfewer than 300 faculty membershaving over15 years of experience. Additionally, the number offemale faculty members at IITKis thelowestamong IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Roorkee. Nevertheless, IIT Kanpur maintains thehighest faculty-to-student ratioamong the top IITs,standing at 0.068,surpassing IIT Madras, IIT Bombay, IIT Roorkee, and IIT Delhi.",
      "We reviewed the online course offerings of IITs via platforms like MOOCs and noted a surge in courses from IIT Kanpur in 2020-21, followed by a decrease the next year.",
      "An intriguing finding related to research funding was that while institutes like IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, and IIT Madras have each received approx. 326, 408, and 499 crores, respectively, forsponsored researchaveraged over the past three years, IIT Kanpur has secured only₹237 crores.Though the number of sponsored research projects has been on the rise, thetotal fundingreceived has seen adecline.",
      "According to the Deputy Director, Dr Braj Bhushan Singh, there are two primary reasons for lesser research funding. First, the number of faculty at IITK has traditionally been significantly lower than that of other old IITs, which inevitably reduces the number of researchers. Second, there is less focus on writing large projects when a group of faculty members comes together. Over the past few years, the institute has recruited a significant number of faculty and is now encouraging faculty to bid for large projects.",
      "Another observation based on the data submitted by IITs to the NIRF was that IIT Kanpur (IITK) has received thelowest funding for consultancy projectscompared to other top IITs. Addressing this, the Deputy Director explained that consultancy projects largely depend on faculty expertise, leading to various project types. Regarding funding, he emphasised that the allocation of funds is influenced by the size of the faculty. Theinstitute’s funding for consultancy projectshasalmost tripled in the previous three years, as reflected in the submitted data.",
      "After analysing data across various other IITs, it’s evident that the percentage of students pursuing higher studies has dropped significantly over the past three years. However, IIT Kanpur continues to haveone of the highest percentages of studentspursuing further education, with24% of undergraduatesand26% of postgraduatesopting for advanced studies after graduating from IITK in the academic year 2022-23.",
      "A concerning number that we came across while researching was the average number of full-time PhD students that have graduated in the last three years. This number was218 in IIT Kanpur, being the second lowest in older IITs, compared to the likes of Bombay, which had the highest, 328.",
      "Peer perception refers to evaluating an institution’s reputation and quality as assessed by other institutions. It involves feedback collected from academic peers (such as faculty members, researchers, and administrators) and industry professionals familiar with the institution. This peer perception score helps NIRF assess how well the institution is regarded in terms of its academic and research excellence, infrastructure, and overall contributions to education and society. This is done through a large-scale survey conducted by NIRF itself, thereby creating a comprehensive list that takes into account various sectors, regions, and other factors. This list is dynamic and is updated periodically. The following infographic shows the scores of top IITs in the peer perception category. IIT Kanpur lacks here as compared to top IITs, scoring significantly lower than IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, and IIT Bombay.",
      "Innovation, as a category, was only introduced in 2023 to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across Indian higher education institutions. NIRF Innovation aims to motivate institutions to focus on research and development that leads to practical solutions and helps build a globally competitive environment for fostering advanced innovations.",
      "In 2024,808 institutes registeredin this category, whileonly 10 were ranked and published.IIT Kanpur ranked1st in innovationin the year of the category’s inception but experienced a significant decline to5th in the latest 2024 edition.To delve deeper into the reasons for this fall, we at Vox Populi interviewed Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, former professor-in-charge of SIIC, IITK. The following part of the article is primarily based on this interview.",
      "When asked about the rankings, he remarked, “Rankings are a very interesting thing. We are happy when we get a good ranking, and we absolutely don’t like the concept when it’s bad. I am not a fan of these rankings as they don’t capture the parameters that should be captured.” He also shed light on the challenging task of data collection, stating, “The whole process of collecting these data from the startups of the institute is not a trivial task. Last year, when I was involved, I personally had to call them all to get the data as they don’t have any incentive to give the data for NIRF.” He also pointed out thatstartups have a long gestation period.At IIT Kanpur, thebulk of startupsthat started on a productive scalehappened after 2019.So, the numbers can go up again in upcoming years.",
      "Adding along similar lines, Prof. Braj Bhushan said,“Last year was the first time it was announced, and we did a better job in providing data than many others, resulting in a high rank. This year, others have also provided full data, and the criteria is also different.”",
      "In the Research and Innovation Output section, IITK has214 patents granted in the past three years (2020 – 22)and a total of56 crores in innovation grantsfor the same period. This number is relatively low compared to other top IITs like IIT Bombay and IIT Madras. Prof Bandyopadhyay, while talking about these statistics, explained, “Products/technologies/designs (that are patented) are developed, mostly, with the extramural funds(mostly provided by government funding bodies like DBT DST etc.)which faculty members secure. The 214 patents granted refer to similar products or designs developed using these funds, often called R&D funds. On the other hand, 56 crore rupees refers to the funds IITK received in the past three years to support startups at SIIC through incubator-related activities(from sources like government agencies, corporate donors, and CSR contributions). These two numbers are not correlated in our case. However, since R&D funds earned by faculty can technically be considered innovation grants, I believe some IITs might report these grants, along with direct incubator/startup funding, as the total innovation grant received in a year.”",
      "Another aspect of this is the commercialisation of patents, which measures the ability to earn money through the patents post-granting. IIT Kanpur lacks here as well, withonly seven commercialised patents in 2022 and a total of 18 over the past three years.“IIT Kanpur is conservative in its approach compared to other IITs,” he added. “IIT Bombay has a system where they initially give the patent at a lesser price with an agreement to finish the deal after the buyer pays a certain amount after a few years. This is well reflected as they have a combined 77 commercialised patents over the past 3 years. We, however, are not yet ready to have this kind of system. Our location puts us at a disadvantage as well.” Conversely, Prof. Braj Bhushan shared an optimistic view regarding the number of granted patents over the years: “Thenumber of patents grantedfor IIT Kanpur hasincreasedfrom64 in 2021 to 140 in 2023.Also, in a remarkable display of innovation, IIT Kanpur has achieved a significant milestone by achieving anexceptional licensing rate of around 14%.”",
      "In the financial support for innovation part, VC (Venture capitalist)  and FD (Foreign Direct)  investments are considered a metric that helps promote startups.The following infographics show the data for top IITs.Prof. Bandyopadhyay expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the submitted data, stating, “I am not sure how reliable the data is for these investments. The scrutiny is very uncertain, and the gap is significant.”",
      "Pre-incubation and incubation are crucial for fostering startups. IIT Kanpur has itsown incubation centre called SIIC.On asking about pre-incubation, “Pre-incubation is when you are preparing a startup before it becomes a company,” Prof. Bandyopadhyay explained. “I am strictlyagainst having a pre-incubation centreat IIT Kanpur as you cannot make startups sign an agreement that guarantees they will be incubated here after pre-incubation, and without agreements to stay with IIT Kanpur for incubation, promising startups may move elsewhere, leading to a loss of potential contributions to the institute’s innovation ecosystem. I experienced this when a student of mine went to incubate at IIT Bombay after getting initial support from IIT Kanpur. Our location works against us here as well.”",
      "Regarding the metric ofcredit courses offered in innovation, IIT Kanpur hasno such courses for UG.“Here we are lagging”, he admitted. “IIT Bombay has an advantage in this field. They have a dedicated centre for entrepreneurship. They operate with visiting professors’ practice and have a flurry of courses on entrepreneurship. We must pick up on this. I have recently started a course in this domain. It is a 600-level course that is open to UGs as well. It’s called Healthcare Ventures and Enterprises. I expect similar initiatives to be taken in the forthcoming time.”",
      "In conclusion, Prof. Bandyopadhyay offered his thoughts on the future of innovation at IIT Kanpur. “These rankings tend to derail the true aim of institutions, which is why I don’t fully support them. Look at BITS Pilani—their industry conversion rate is much better, and they don’t care about rankings. We should focus more on building a robust innovation culture than chasing rankings.”",
      "He also outlined some key initiatives that could help IIT Kanpur regain its footing: “First, we need to establish an emotional connection with our startups. They should feel a sense of belonging to the incubator, which is crucial for overcoming challenges. Second, we need to attract more investment by preparing startups for pitches and improving their standards. Third, we must showcase our startups better to the outside world. Unless we strengthen these fundamentals, we can’t expect to climb the rankings again.”",
      "In conclusion, NIRF gives a deeper insight into an institution, from teaching and graduation outcomes to research and development. While IIT Kanpur has demonstrated notable achievements in specific areas, such as maintaining a high faculty-to-student ratio and excelling in the number of students opting for higher education, there remains a need to strengthen its focus on innovation, research funding, and faculty recruitment to enhance its overall performance.",

      "Recently, the Administration Section of IIT Kanpur issued an eviction notice to the residents of the Type-1A, Type-1B, and Dhobi Ghat accommodations of the institute, directing them to vacate the premises by December 17, 2024. The decision has initiated conversations across the campus, raising questions about its cause, impact, and future course.",
      "In order to give a thorough account, Vox Populi spoke with a range of stakeholders, including affected residents, administrative authorities, and others, in order to understand the implications of this notice.",
      "The eviction notice states that inspections conducted by two institutions, the Structural Engineering Laboratory, Civil Engineering Department, IIT Kanpur and Department of Civil Engineering, Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), identified critical structural issues with the Type-1A, Type-1B, and Dhobi Ghat accommodations.",
      "As per the notice, the report from the Structural Engineering Laboratory described these buildings as being in a “severely dilapidated condition” and noted that they “did not meet the seismic requirements of the present earthquake codes.”",
      "The notice also mentions a third-party inspection carried out by the Department of Civil Engineering, HBTU, which reportedly concluded that “the buildings are depleted and unsafe and also cannot be restored by retrofitting.” Based on these findings, the notice declares the structures “uninhabitable,” recommends their demolition and requires residents to vacate within 21 days.",
      "To understand the perspective of the Structural Engineering Laboratory, we reached out to nine professors and the Principal Security Officer of the lab. Of these, six professors stated they haven’t worked upon it or were unaware of any such investigation, while the remaining individuals have not responded so far.",
      "Additionally, we contacted the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DOIP) and Registrar of IIT Kanpur and also the Department of Civil Engineering at HBTU for their insights. However, we did not receive a response so far.",
      "On November 27, 2024, personnel including male and female SIS guards and staff from the IIT Kanpur Estate Office served eviction notices to the residents of the above-mentioned area. Additionally, banners were displayed, stating that the premises must be vacated within 21 days due to safety concerns. Warnings written in red ink on the walls said that electricity and water connections would be cut if the premises were not vacated by the stipulated deadline, as outlined in the notice also.",
      "Residents of the above-mentioned area include 17 Dhobi households, several security personnel, employees of the institute’s offices, departments and labs, etc.",
      "The Dhobi households residing in Dhobi Ghat have long provided end-to-end laundry services to thousands of students and staff on campus. The demolition of Dhobi Ghat would affect these services. In light of this, Vox reached out to the Dhobis to gather their perspectives on the matter:",
      "TheDhobis said that they were issued the notice twice, second time on November 30. The notice was also affixed to the doors and walls of their houses by the administration.",
      "The sudden issuance of eviction notices caused significant unrest among them. In response, they organized themselves and sought support from faculty members, students, and administration to help raise awareness about their situation.",
      "Following is a letter shared by Dhobis regarding the points raised by them:",
      "The primary concern raised by the dhobis was the need for an alternative housing and workplace arrangement within the campus if the institute required them to vacate Dhobi Ghat. They stated that moving off-campus would create significant challenges for their work.",
      "According to them, handling large volumes of clothes daily requires flexible hours and round-the-clock shifts, which would not be possible with fixed working hours. They also shared that relocating could reduce efficiency, compromise the safety of clothes, and increase service costs due to logistical difficulties. Additionally, they stated that they have no housing arrangements outside campus.To understand the issues raised by Dhobis better please refer to the following coverage of Vox Populi:Dhobighat: A Laundry List of Injustices – Vox Populi",
      "When we reached out to the other residents of the area, they expressed their concerns, stating,“We have no choice but to leave and seek alternative housing outside the campus and continue our work from there. Some residents have already left. We cannot request alternative arrangements as the institute is not obligated to provide them.”",
      "The following section of article is based on our conversation with the Dean of Administration (DoAd), Professor Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava",
      "Professor Vaibhav states that the eviction notice is not targeted at any specific group, including the Dhobis, but applies to all residents of the area, which also includes institute staff.",
      "Professor Vaibhav claimed that several Dhobis associated with the institute are already operating from outside the campus.The administration suggests that the Dhobis residing at Dhobi Ghat could follow a similar model.(In response to Professor Vaibhav’s claim, the Dhobis contended that most of those operating from outside the campus use the institute’s Dhobi Ghat for washing purposes.)",
      "He adds that the institute is ready to assist residents in making alternative arrangements outside the campus, should they request such support. Some residents (not Dhobis) might be getting the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as an alternative.(When asked, the Dhobis mentioned that no formal written assurances have been provided to them.)",
      "Regarding structural reports and comments mentioned in the eviction notice, Professor Vaibhav directed us to the DOIP, as the former did not have access to the reports.(When we reached out to the DOIP regarding this matter, we were redirected to the Registrar and the Deputy Director of the institute. Subsequently, we contacted both the parties, but have not received a response yet.)",
      "When asked about the future use of the vacated space, he emphasized that the institute’s priority order is: Students & Faculty > Staff > Other groups (e.g. Dhobis). The utilization of the area will be decided accordingly, based on the pressing requirements of the institute, whether for hostels, labs, or other facilities.",

      "In May this year, Hall 13’s Hall Executive Committee (HEC) completed its first tenure. As the next elections for HEC are around the corner,  we explore the development of HEC, covering its initial setup, challenges, and recent changes. Vox spoke to hec members, alumni and conducted a survey to look at election problems, the unique block-wise system and reviewed past efforts to establish a functional HEC.",
      "A HEC is a committee that represents the collective views of the residents, coordinates with administration and manages the day-to-day functioning of the hall. It handles the hall budget; and arbitrates intra-hall disputes, if any.",
      "The demands for creating an HEC in Hall 13 gained traction due to various issues faced by its residents. These issues included (but weren’t limited to):",
      "The impetus for change was catalysed by a group of PG students from the design department, who had seen how HECs functioned at other halls. A PG student stated, “Almost all PGs had joined in,” emphasising the broad-based support for the initiative. Discussions with hall administration were carried out, but they proved inconclusive.",
      "There were also previous attempts by UG Y22 students after COVID-19 to establish an HEC. However, their attempts were shut down with the reasoning that their tenure would be too short, given the time it takes for campaigning and elections.",
      "Initially refusing their demands last year, the hall office and wardens eventually agreed to the formation of an HEC for Y23s after the Students’ Gymkhana got involved.",
      "The HEC of Hall 13 follows a block-wise structure, with each block (A to F) having two positions for student representation, assigned randomly. In 2023-24, two wings in the F block were allocated to MDes students, so one HEC post, Mess Secretary, was reserved exclusively for them. Additionally, residents from each block can only vote for the two posts designated for their respective block.",
      "Also, differing from other halls, there is an absence of a president within the HEC. When asked about the rationale behind this distinctive arrangement, Sambhav (a Y23 HEC member from MDes.) responded, “We aimed for a structure that ensures equitable representation of every block, so we can prioritise the concerns of each block.”",
      "This framework was created by students during discussions with wardens, the hall office, and Gymkhana representatives. When asked about the same, Dhwanit Balwani, ex-PSG, said, “First-year students are new and don’t have administrative experience. They don’t know how to run a team of students together while leading as a president. They don’t have enough calibre for such a task. This can also result in one person having irregular power over others.”",
      "Dhruv Misra, the current PSG, stated “The role of Hall President involves a significant amount of responsibilities, and it’s unfair to expect first-year students to be aware of all the nuances at the very outset. The responsibilities of the Hall President were dealt with majorly by Dhwanit (as PSG) and I (as Convener, CoSHA). There is no specific representative for Hall 13 in CoSHA, but all the concerns of the Hall are put forth by the Convener, CoSHA in the meeting, and since it is open to the entire campus community, the entire HEC or any individual from Hall 13 can attend.”",
      "In our survey, 68% of Hall 13 residents largely agreed with Dhruv regarding not having a Hall President.  Vox also attempted to reach out to the ex-Warden, Prof. Mohite, however, he was unavailable for comments.",
      "The HEC elections, conducted by the Election Commission in October, took place two months after the Y23s arrived. The code of conduct was enforced immediately, followed by campaigning and a soapbox. Mess, Maintenance, and Sports secretary positions saw the highest nominations, with four contestants each. Cultural secretary had two candidates, while accounts and common room had one each.",
      "On Election Day, a technical error in the online polling portal led to uncounted votes. A second round of voting using paper ballots was held the next day, but the turnout was significantly lower.",
      "From the survey of 220 responses, 51% voted in both elections, while 23% did not vote at all. Among non-voters, 30% felt their votes wouldn’t matter, and 28% cited a lack of awareness and transparency.",
      "NOTA won against candidates for Maintenance and Accounts, leaving these positions vacant. In the first HEC meeting, it was decided that one member would manage three positions, with no additional nominations, unlike other halls.",
      "The survey collected responses to gauge people’s impressions of how effectively the students believed the HEC could conduct its duties given its unique characteristics.",
      "When the GBM was asked about their views on the block reservation system, 51% of the respondents opposed it. We then asked whether residents felt the HEC was biased towards one hall. Notably, nearly 44% of participants perceived such a bias, indicating a significant concern. Additionally, one of the residents mentioned, “The HEC closes the mess citing pest control whenever there is hall day in any of the parent halls,” and various others shared similar sentiments, suggesting potential influence from the parent halls.",
      "Next, to assess the accessibility of the HEC to the residents, we asked them to rate it on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not accessible at all and 5 being very accessible. The responses varied widely, ultimately averaging out to a score of 2.72, highlighting a significant disparity in residents’ perceptions of HEC accessibility.",
      "When questioned if the HEC was able to make an impact in their tenure, 73% of people denied the notion. They pointed out the problems of washing machines not being solved despite continuous requests, and the quality of mess food fluctuating among other reasons.",
      "We also sought residents’ opinions on two major HEC initiatives: the Diwali Celebration and the Hall Day Celebration.",
      "The Hall Day Celebration received mixed reviews. Some responses pointed out issues with management by HEC and some deemed the event expensive. One respondent pointed out, “The Hall day celebrations created a lot of controversies and even fights within the hall residents and HEC. Even within the HEC all the members were not in favour of Hall day. It was somehow forced on the Hall residents.“",
      "The Diwali Celebration received mainly positive reviews. With people calling it a better initiative than hall day. One respondent noted, “The HEC did an exceptional job organising the event, setting it apart from all other halls. From the morning Diwali Pooja to the evening firecracker show, everything was magnificent, attracting large numbers of attendees from other halls.”",
      "Note:The following part of the article is based on discussions with :",
      "Deepankur Kansal,Y18, an HEC Member of Hall 13",
      "Vedaant Sikka, Y18, President, Students’ Gymkhana 2021-22",
      "The first UG batch residents of Hall 13 were the Y18 batch. Initially, Hall 13 faced several issues, mainly regarding basic amenities in the mess. This led to a need for a Hall Executive Committee (HEC) to improve living conditions. Many students approached the Hall Warden, and it was decided to establish an HEC, but without elections.",
      "The initial structure had each of the 36 wings selecting a wing representative among themselves. These 36 representatives were divided into four groups of nine, focusing on Mess, Maintenance, Sports, and Cultural activities. However, this structure faced difficulties as no one had signing authority for any of these domains.",
      "To address this, the size of each group was reduced from nine to two, giving these individuals the authority to make decisions based on discussions with the entire group. This change reduced the total number of representatives from 36 to 8. Although this structure functioned better, many members lost interest over time, and the number of active members dwindled. By the end of the HEC’s tenure, some financial issues in Hall 13 led the warden to decide against having an HEC in the future.",
      "When the Y19 batch arrived, they were not allowed to form an HEC. However, in November, a new warden, Professor PM Mohite, took charge. The President, Students’ Gymkhana and the Convener of COSHA resumed discussions with the new warden, successfully advocating for the formation of an HEC. This time, members were nominated based on interviews rather than elections, and notably, the HEC did not have a president.",
      "Shortly after its formation, a mid-semester break happened, and as students did not return to campus due to COVID, limiting the HEC’s activities.",
      "Later, during the tenure of Vedaant Sikka, the Convener, CoSHA for 2020-21,the initiative to form an HEC for the upcoming batches (Y20 and later) was takenl. A model for the same was discussed in the CoSHA and a proposal was passed which suggested the following:",
      "Overall, it was stressed that Hall 13’s concept differed from other UG halls, focusing primarily on improving facilities and organising cultural events like Hall Day v/s the role of parent UG HECs which additionally involves participating in GC & other inter-hall events.",
      "However, due to uncertainties about the residence and the late arrival of the Y20 and Y21 batches, the formation of the HEC did not work out as planned. Furthermore, the structure was not carried forward for subsequent batches of Y22 and Y23.",
      "Vedaant believes that a better structure to implement for HEC would resemble his proposal.",
      "He also discussed how the mixing of undergraduate and postgraduate students in the halls, initially implemented as a temporary measure due to a crunch in hall capacity, is not the ideal model, due to their fundamentally different expectations from halls. With the recent increase in hall capacity, he emphasised the need to revisit this arrangement and reduce UG-PG mixing in halls to the extent possible",
      "As this tenure of the Y23 HEC has concluded, some faith has been built that freshers can handle their own affairs. The current HEC has vowed to ensure that the next HEC is formed and a transfer of power takes place smoothly. They have secured support from the warden for future tenures. Starting next year, any vacant HEC positions could be filled through the standard renomination and interview process in consultation with the warden.",
      "With a new HEC set up in Hall 13, questions come up about how to ensure fair and adequate representation. Considering the significant presence of postgraduate students in other UG halls, should their representation be proportional to their numbers there as well? Similarly, does the precedent set by Hall 13 suggest that fresher undergraduate girls should have representation in the HEC of Hall 4? These are questions that merit further investigation.",

      "Cycle repair shops located in front of hostels have been a vital part of campus life for a very long time, providing essential services to the community every day. However, recent developments have put these shops at risk, as vendors have been asked to vacate their spaces. In this article, Vox delves into the current structure of the working of these shops, explores the challenges in their functioning, and examines the changes proposed by the estate office. We also spoke with various stakeholders to understand the impact of these developments on both the vendors and the campus community.",
      "There are two types of cycle shops on campus: those that rent shops through Estate Office tenders and are officially allowed to sell bicycles, and those operating with a vendor’s pass issued by the SIS Office, which only permits them to repair bicycles within the campus. The former can be found in various locations, including the Old Shopping Complex and MT, while the latter are located at the entrances of different halls, with eight such shops in total. Due to their proximity to the hostels, the vendor shops tend to be more accessible to students. Vendors with a pass are permitted only to arrive in the morning, repair bicycles throughout the day, and leave campus with their tools by evening.",
      "Vox spoke with a cycle shop owner near a hostel to understand the process of obtaining a vendor pass. The owner explained that they usually receive a form from the security office, which requires signatures from the hall’s warden and two other professors before being submitted to the Estate Office. This procedure has been in place for as long as these vendors have been on campus, some for up to 20 years. A vendor’s pass costs ₹360 per year, whereas renting a shop is much more expensive. Although these vendors typically operate under passes, over time, they have built permanent sheds and have begun selling second-hand bicycles, which is not permitted under the pass.",
      "A cycle shop owner at the Old Shopping Complex, who has the shop tender, noted that his earnings significantly declined after COVID-19, especially when outside vendors were allowed on campus during the peak student arrival period (July-August). He told that his specialized gear repair skills attract off-campus customers and have kept him in business, unlike other shops that closed due to lack of expertise. He also mentioned that the cycle shop vendors near hostels have further affected his business.",
      "In June, cycle shop vendors attempted to renew their passes as they usually do. However, this time the Estate Office refused to process the renewals for all vendors. When the vendors inquired about the issue, they were informed that the Security Office would now handle the pass renewals. However, when they approached the Security Office, they were redirected back to the Estate Office, leaving them caught in a loop. By mid-June, security guards at the gates warned the vendors to renew their passes or vacate the space, as they would be denied entry to the campus after July 1st. However,the eviction process was halted following the intervention of some Hall Presidents, who met with the Estate Office to address the issue..",
      "However, later a letter was sent to wardens of various hostels, whichstatedthat the cycle shops in front of the hostels encroach on institute land. Wardens were requested to allocate space for cycle shops within the hostels, if needed, through a tendering process. The deadline for this process was set for August 31, 2024.",
      "When asked about the possible impacts of removal of these shops on the cycle shop vendors and their services, they highlighted the following concerns:",
      "Vox spoke with Mr. Dhruv Misra, President of Students’ Gymkhana, to understand the reasons behind this alteration. He highlighted that the primary concern is security. The Security Office had received complaints about security risks, including unknown individuals entering the campus and gathering at these shops. He pointed out that if any unfortunate incidents occur due to these shops, it would be unclear who should be held accountable since they are not part of the official tender process.",
      "He also mentioned that the cycle pumps (compressors) are provided and funded by the hostels themselves. Additionally, he stated that all vendors plying on campus have to undergo a formal registration for legal and safety purposes. In return, the institute would provide them with facilities, such as secured space for their equipment.",
      "Vox reached out to the Estate Office and the Dean of Administration for their opinion on this matter. However, they refused to comment, stating that the issue is still under process.",
      "When asked about the impact of these measures on the campus community, Dhruv acknowledged that it would affect them. He claimed that the goal is not to take away facilities from them but to provide them in a proper and designated manner.",
      "Regarding the next steps, he stated that to expedite the process, the management will soon organize a meeting with all hall wardens. This meeting will aim to resolve disputes and provide the vendors with a designated place at a minimal cost.",
      "As of August 30th, the meeting with wardens has not been organised yet.",
      "Amidst these developments, when we reached out to the cycle shop vendors again, they told us that no shops had been allocated to them inside the halls, as of August 30th, 2024. Additionally, they have been instructed to vacate their current spaces by August 31st, 2024.",

      "Note: This article is an Opinion piece by Sweta, Pool Captain, Shauryas (Takneek 22-23)",
      "Takneek, the inter-pool science and technology championship, is conducted annually by the Science and Technology (SnT) Council, IIT Kanpur. The students are divided into 5 pools, namely Aryans, Kshatriyas, Nawabs, Peshwas, and Shauryas. This division is done based on the halls of residence.",
      "For example, the pool-wise hall division for Takneek 22-23 was as follows:",
      "Pool Shauryas is the pool of all female students. Shauryas has ranked last in all editions of Takneek conducted so far. This opinion piece is an analysis of the potential reasons behind this.",
      "It is interesting to note here how the official term used is ‘pool’ while the majority refers to it in daily conversations as ‘hall’.  This can be seen vividly through the hall t-shirts of the UG halls, which have the pool names and symbols on them, and hence the understanding developed here is from the perspective of halls: four male halls and one female hall.",
      "There are various issues associated with the participation of the pool of females in Takneek. The resource and budget constraints, representation in the Science and Technology Council, and lack of guidance have been analysed here.",
      "There are various hardware-based events and problem statements. The SnT Council allocates a budget of approximately  INR 6000 for the same. Any additional funds needed were to be arranged by the pools themselves. Takneek has been a UG-centric activity, and hence, the PG halls do not invest in it. This becomes important for the case of the female pool, because the first-year UG students now reside in a primarily PG hall. This change happened Y22 batch onwards due to the space crunch on campus.",
      "As mentioned above, the pool of females (now Shauryas, formerly known as Veeras) was formed very recently. Moreover, the position of the Science and Technology Secretary in the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) was introduced in the tenure 2022-23 for the first time. They lacked not just funds and hardware but also the logistical know-how of the functioning of Takneek.",
      "An incident in particular which reflects upon this is from Takneek 22-23.  The participation of 1st/2nd/3rd-year UGs is made compulsory for Takneek (as it is an exploratory and learning event for freshers). From the Y22 batch onwards, first-year female undergraduate students reside in Hall 4. With no historical logistical setup as such, there was a major confusion between Halls 6 and 4 on who should fund Takneek. While the other halls have been funding Takneek for many years, despite the freshers residing in Hall 13, this was a new situation for the female pool. Due to the misunderstanding between the two halls, participation from Hall 4 was hindered. This confusion led to the first-year students, who are residents of Hall 4, not being able to participate for 2-3 days, which is a huge setback for any type of problem statement.",
      "Secondly, as the history of Takneek gives the male pools a stronger ground to stand on since they had the majority of these hardware materials within their reach, the halls were also willing to invest significantly greater amounts of their budgets for the sake of culture, one which is yet to develop for the pool of females.This creates a division in the quality of submissions made. As evidence of the above-stated factor, here is a recommendation from the Post Conduction Report of Takneek 23-24 – “Many concerns were raised regarding the conduction of the hardware PS’s in Takneek, we would recommend that either the construction of hardwares of all the pools shall be enforced to be made very similar by the guidelines of the PS, if there is a scope of creativity of distinctiveness in construction of hardware, each and every case of submission should be very carefully thought of and very descriptive PS should be designed.”",
      "The undergraduate students are distributed between various halls on a gender and graduation year basis. The pools are divided such that each pool has an equal distribution of students from all years. Approximately 1000 undergraduate students are there in each pool. However, in reality, not all members of a pool participate in such events.",
      "The effective participation in Takneek comes from students who a) are currently associated with the SnT council, b) were previously associated with it, and c) want to explore the council/plan to be associated with it. These students are the following:",
      "*They are usually the ones who make the problem statements and are not allowed to participate but make up an essential part of the analysis.",
      "Here is an assessment of the number of people involved in the SnT council per pool during each year’s Takneek:",
      "A.) Takneek 22-23 : In this edition of Takneek, only a few entities had their problem statements, and only those are considered for the analysis.",
      "B.)Takneek 23-24: For this edition, the problem statements for each category were selected from a random draw from a fixed set of problem statements submitted by all entities, and hence the entire council is considered.",
      "*For this analysis, the total number of males vs females for each category was analysed. The total number of males was then divided by 4, to take into account the average number of people in the SnT council from a male pool. (Data source: SnT  Council ratification lists)",
      "Note: These numbers since the Y20 batch are the maximum that has been seen yet. This is also partly because of the jump in the intake of female students.",
      "While the guidance available to the junior batches in a pool cannot be quantified, the importance and relevance of it is mutually agreed upon by all the participating pools. This is so because the problem statements are specific to the domains covered by respective entities within the council. Therefore, with more domain-specific guidance, the solutions proposed improve qualitatively. Moreover, the number of pool members associated with major entities (some entities have more problem statements or higher weightage) has a direct proportionality with the quality of submissions and the points secured.",
      "The lack of seniors available for guidance (majorly Y19s and Y20s) for pool Shauryas was a major factor contributing to their position in the competition. When compared against the guidance given by experienced seniors to the other pools, this shows the lack clearly. Moreover, it is a commonly held ideology that ‘girls lack the motivation for Takneek’. This can be questioned when the number of submissions made are assessed. Pool Shauryas had almost the same number of submissions as the male pools. The fact that the pool still secured the last position supports the argument that it was because of the poor quality and not a lack of motivation.",
      "These factors, guidance, representation, and resource constraints, contribute greatly to determining where females will land in such events. For this reason, such a result not only reinforces sexist stereotypes but also hits hard the self-esteem of first-year undergraduate women. However, it is important to note that we are not dealing with a mere problem-solving situation here; rather, what is needed is a more profound comprehension of the present context. By refraining from proposing solutions immediately we give ourselves time to fully understand all details involved. The understanding acts as our first major step towards righting the wrongs caused by years of this kind of imbalance.",
      "It is important that we acknowledge and recognize the hard work put in by many undergraduate female students. They should receive equal amounts of attention as male students who have achieved dissimilar levels of success. To my dear colleagues who have worked tirelessly for hours on end, your input counts just as much as anyone else’s does.",

      "Note: This article is an Editorial by Vox Populi,IIT Kanpur",
      "Following a contention raised in the Students’ Senate against our article “A Review of the 55th Inter IIT Sports Meet,” published on 3rd October 2023, a review committee was formed to deliberate upon the matter.Vox was directed by the Review Board to take down the investigative piece, citing multiple violations of the “Journalism Ethics and Standards document” in the article.",
      "We stand by our work and do not agree with the findings of the Review Board.We argue that the investigation by the Review Board was procedurally flawed and incomplete, a stance we elaborate on in the following Slides.",
      "However, as a body under the Gymkhana mandate, we have redacted the article from all formal channels until further deliberation.",
      "On the 8th of November, a contention was presented on the senate floor by the Ex-GenSec, Games & Sports (2022-23), claiming the article violated several clauses in the “Journalism Ethics and Standards document.”",
      "In response to the contention, a five-member Review Committee was formed consisting of the President, Chairperson, parliamentarian, and 2 Ex- Vox members supposed to be nominated by the Senate.",
      "The Review Board met once to discuss the contentions, and recommended that the article be taken down along with a formal communication to the GBM.",
      "To begin with, we argue that Vox was not fairly consulted in presenting their perspective on important contentions.An investigative piece spans months of preparation, with the Editors and the article team spending significant time drafting the piece with all its sources and claims.",
      "As a result, the Editors have a great deal of contextual knowledge about the article, the sources, and the claims made within it.",
      "We argue that the Editors’ views, for the most part, were not invited, and even where they were, their clarifications were not incorporated in the minutes that led to the said recommendations. This, for us, renders the Review Board’s Investigation incomplete.",
      "For example, Vox interviewed the DCL(Deputy Contingent Leader), 55th Inter IIT Sports Meet, who said (and we quoted) :“Anybody shouldn’t take POR for the sake of placement; rather, they should be motivated towards doing something big. Things were in place this time, but the Student Representatives as a whole lacked the zeal to win the Inter IIT.”",
      "The review board found that VOX had violated the“Journalism Ethics and Standards document” against the quotation itself, stating,",
      "The Board felt that B.5.1 was violated by the statements as they felt that the statements were highly opinionated and their repetitive mentions showed a lack of objectivity in themselves.",
      "At another place, the article quotes a coach saying :“The Ex-SPEC and GnS council was not providing us with these facilities…… [A coach regarding some facilities for teams].”",
      "To which the review board says :The Board acknowledged that the Games & Sports Council is not supposed to spend its budget on Inter IIT preparation as per the Constitution of the Students’ Gymkhana. Hence, it was found that the statement contained misinformation.",
      "Wherever the stakeholders, be it coaches, DCLs or Team Captain, have voiced concerns against PoR holders, the Review Board found that a violation had occurred.",
      "The events highlighted above set a dangerous precedent. This process of reviewing without",
      "1) having proper grounds",
      "2) giving Vox a chance to defend itself enables people in power to effectively use the Review Board as a censorship mechanism. This will make raising issues related to the Gymkhana / position holders very difficult and impede our ability to do meaningful journalism.",
      "Given these circumstances, we do not feel we were given an adequate space and a proper platform to present our views and thoughts on this matter. Clause B.1, Appendix B of the Journalism Ethics & Standards Document states that “It is expected that the board covers all perspectives before landing on a decision.” However, not all perspectives have been covered, and the investigation has been full of procedural errors",

      "The election of Vijaya Mishra, a postgraduate student, as the chairperson of the IIT Kanpur Students’ Senate has sparked a series of events within the Student Senate; Ms Vijaya Mishra has alleged that there has been achain of serious politically motivated attempts to prevent her from assuming the Chairperson’s role.This report delves into the specifics of the Joint Senate Meeting 2024 and the events surrounding Vijaya’s appointment.",
      "The election for the position of the Student Senates’ Chairperson for the Incoming Senate (2024-25) took place onFebruary 9th, 2024, on the Senate Floor. During the meeting, 68 senators cast votes, and Ms. Vijaya Mishra received 36 votes, winning the election by a simple majority.",
      "OnMarch 20th, 2024– the 9th (Special) meeting of the Senate had an agenda item that proposed to introduceamendments to Appendix Fof the Constitution.This amendedthe eligibility toapply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhanafor PG Students. The attempt to amend this Appendix was made on the mailing list, followed by heavy back and forth by the senators, some of whom claimed the procedures followed were unconstitutional. On6th April, the Outgoing Chairperson considered the amendment “hereby ratified”, claiming consensus from the Senate.",
      "With the amendment in the background, in theJoint Senate Meetingon8th April 2024– before the outgoing chairperson ( Prashant ) could formally hand over the position, he announced that ano-confidence motionhad been raised against the newly elected Chairperson, Vijaya Mishra. This development led to immediate procedural complications, as the outgoing Chairperson had already vacated the chair. The No-Confidence Motion, among many things, was based on contentions againstVijaya’s academic eligibility. Pending this Verification from the DoAA office, the meeting was adjourned. The meeting was to reconvene on12th April at 20:30.On12th April at 18:17– the Chairperson received a response from the Joint Registrar, DoAA office, which stated:“Her academic status is active normal and she is not on warning”(Whether this clears the eligibility criteria awaits clarification). At19:57on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that thesenate meeting was postponeddue to “ambiguity in a few documents.”",
      "One of the agenda items of the meeting,“To consider the finalised versions of Constitution & Appendices”,was proposed to introduce amendments to Appendix F of the Constitution.  This included theeligibility to apply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhana for PG Students.",
      "However,the meeting was adjourned due to the heated environment that arose in the senatefollowingthe de-ratification of the Post Conduction Report for Galaxy, and it’s subsequent scrapping, and the issue was subsequently discussed over the senate’smailing list.On 6th April, the Outgoing Chairperson considered the amendment“hereby ratified”, claiming consensus from the Senate.",
      "Joint Meetings are special senate meetings designated to be a handing over session, where both members of the current and incoming senate are present as full-fledged members. The scheduled charge transfer process within the IIT Kanpur Student Senate was halted due to a series of events. The outgoing Chairperson, Mr. Prashant Kumar Mishra, began by presenting his end-termreport, which was passed by the Senate without any contentions.",
      "However, just before Prashant could formally hand over the position, he announced that a no-confidence motion had been raised against the newly elected Chairperson, Vijaya Mishra. This development led to immediate procedural complications, as the outgoing Chairperson had already vacated the chair.",
      "A heated discussion ensued on whether the incoming parliamentarian  (Mr Ujjwal) or the outgoing parliamentarian (Mr Abhiraj) should chair the proceedings. Ultimately, it was decided thatMr. Abhiraj would serve as the officiating Chairperson,since the charge transfer for Parliamentarians had not taken place yet.",
      "The No-Confidence Motion, among many things, was based on contentions against Vijaya’s candidature, one of which questioned her academic standing and eligibility to assume the Chairperson’s role. After a thorough debate themeeting was adjournedpending theDean of Academic Affairs’ response on Vijaya’s academic eligibility.The meeting was to reconvene on 12th April. On 12th April at 18:17 – the Chairperson received a response from the Joint Registrar, DoAA office, which stated: “Her academic status is active normal and she is not on warning”. At 19:57 on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that the senate meeting was postponed due to “ambiguity in a few documents.”",
      "Vijaya has accused that all of these events were politically motivated actions to prevent her from becoming the chairperson, even though she had been elected to the position through a free and fair democratic process. She had three specific allegations regarding the same:",
      "Vijaya’sfirst allegation concerns theamendment to Appendix F, passed over mail. This amendedthe eligibility to apply for all elected and nominated posts of the Student’s Gymkhana for PG Students.She argues that the method through which this amendment was passed and implemented was questionable.",
      "However, there still remains ambiguity on the exact procedure to amend the academic eligibility requirements for the student senate (i.e. Appendix F), and clarification is awaited on the same.",
      "Vijaya claims that the correct procedure was not followed when the amendment was done.",
      "Vijaya’ssecond objectionpertains to the selection of the Chairperson’s nominee for the interviews to appoint coordinators of cells under the President’s Office. She argues that although it’s not mandatory, it’s established tradition for the incoming chairperson to be nominated, which would have been her in this case. However,Vijaya claims she was not appointed as the nominee for any of these interview processes,which she alleges was a discriminatory action against her.",
      "Vijaya has countered the claims of academic ineligibility against her by stating that she hasconclusive evidence that she fulfils the heightened academic criteria set by the Student Senate.She further argues that any amendments made by the Senate cannot be applied to her retrospectively.",
      "To reiterate, the part one presents one perspective on the recent charge handover proceedings held during the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate 2024. The situation remains under investigation, and a complete picture requires the perspective of all involved parties. Pending response from other stakeholders, updates will be published.",
      "Note: This draft is in continuation to Musical Chairs Part -1",
      "In his mail to the Students’ Senate dated 16/04/24, Prashant Mishra, Chairperson of Students’ Senate (2023-24), stated that Vijaya Mishra, the incoming Chairperson of Students’ Senate (2024-25), is ineligible to assume the aforementioned position under Appendix F which states that a person remains eligible if “They have notbeen placed on Academic Probation or Warning by the SUGC/SPGC”. The DoAA office on 10th April at 16:48 had mailed Prashant stating that Vijaya had received a “warning from SPGC for not completing her SOTA seminar in due time”.",
      "Prashant further stated the Charge Handover would resume on 2nd May 2024.",
      "However, trailing the same mail, Ujjawal, the incoming parliamentarian, Students’ Senate(2024-25), had opined that based on his interpretation of various arguments provided(which have been elaborated later), “Ms Vijaya’s academic status is Active Normal, leaving no further discussion on the matter.”",
      "The following article elaborates on the stance of various stakeholders regarding charge handover for the position of Chairperson, Students Senate.",
      "As stated in part one, the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate 2024 was supposed to reconvene on 12th April at 20:30 but at 19:57 on the same day, the Chairperson communicated to the student list that the senate meeting was postponed due to “ambiguity in a few documents.” When asked about what had happened, Prashant elaborated that he had sent a mail to DOAA on Tuesday (9th April, the day after the Joint Meeting of Students’ Senate ) asking for clarification on whether Vijaya was under academic warning in lieu of her thesis credits and SOTA seminar as discussed in the Senate.",
      "To this, the DOAA office replied on Wednesday(10th April), stating that: Ms Vijaya’s “department had been communicated to issue her warning” based on her thesis credits. Additionally, she was also placed on “warning by the SPGC” for not completing her SOTA.",
      "However, on the day of the meeting(12/04/2024), the DOAA office again sent a mail to the Chairperson of the Students’ Senate at 16:48 . Following the previous mail, this mail had an addition to the first point, which stated that with respect to her thesis credits, “ Her academic status is normal/active, and she is not on any warning.” However, the second point of the mail, which mentioned that she had received a warning from SPGC regarding her SOTA, remained the same.",
      "These two seemingly contradictory points led to ambiguity according to Prashant. The offices were closed since it was Friday night; moreover, the DoAA was unavailable due to him being out of the station. Thereby, Prashant could not confirm Vijaya’s academic status and had to postpone the meet.",
      "Later, when the DoAA returned, the President and the Chairperson went to the DoAA office. As per Prashant, after confirming Vijayas’ academic eligibility from DoAA, he mailed the Students’ Senate, informing them that Vijaya was ineligible to become the Chairperson under Appendix F as she had received a warning from SPGC.",
      "In the first part of the article, Vijaya had alleged that “there has been a chain of concerted, politically motivated attempts to prevent her from assuming the Chairperson’s role.”",
      "To this, Dhwanit asserted that “I do not believe this all to be politically motivated, we do what is required, what is right, what follows the book. The amendment was to bring equality.”",
      "Regarding the amendment made to Appendix F over the mailing list, Prashant further clarified that on the matter of relaxing CPI criteria for PG students, he had asked to discuss and reform it through the academic senate because the criteria were sourced from the student governance report published by the academic senate. However, the same is not valid for every clause of Appendix F; hence, the SUGC warning clause was not considered to be in the jurisdiction of the Academic Senate.",
      "The Chairperson of the Students’ Senate has the sole right to determine who will become his nominee in the selection committee of overall coordinators of various cells in the upcoming tenure. Vijaya had claimed that her not being appointed as the nominee for any of the interview processes was discriminatory action against her as this was not in line with the tradition. Prashant agreed that his not nominating Vijaya was against the convention. However, he argued that the person taking the interview of OC of any cell should be very knowledgeable, and according to him, as per his experience in the senate with her, “Vijaya was not knowledgeable enough to interview anyone for the position of OC.”",
      "Prashant further adds that he had kept in mind that the incoming senate should have a say in appointments of OC of various cells; thus, all his nominees were incoming senators, whose credibility he justified based on their past experience in gymkhana. He reiterated that all the nominees for the interview process, including Dhruv, were part of the incoming senate.",
      "In contrast to Vijaya’s claim that amended criteria cannot be applied to her retrospectively, both Dhwanit and Prashant argued that everyone is required to maintain eligibility throughout their tenure; hence, the amended eligibility criteria would apply to them.",
      "On the claim that the amendment (to know in detail about the amendment, refer to part one) would restrict the participation of PG students and was targeted towards Vijaya, we spoke to Dhruv, the Incoming President of Students’ Gymkhana. He said that roughly similar numbers of both UG and PG students are placed under warning every year, and the reason they are asked to refrain from participation in Gymkhana activities is that they can focus on improving their academic record. Thus, placing similar restrictions on UGs and PGs doesn’t target anyone in particular.",
      "Additionally, regarding Vijaya’s academic status being reflected as “normal” in Pingala, Prashant elaborated that Appendix F mentions whether the person concerned had been placed under warning or not among several other criteria; the said appendix nowhere mentions eligibility in relation to “academic status.”",
      "As per the mail sent by Prashant on the Students’ Senates list, Vijaya is ineligible to become Chairperson. Prashant has also stated in the mail that the charge handover meet will convene on 2nd May.",
      "However, in a thread of the same mail, Ujjawal, the incoming parliamentarian, opined that Vijaya is academically eligible to become the Chairperson.",
      "The 3 points raised to support his interpretation were.",
      "Thereby, Ujjawal, the incoming Parliamentarian Students’ Senate, interprets that Ms Vijaya is eligible to hold the position of Chairperson of the Students’ Senate.",
      "Thus, the concerned stakeholders seem divided into two parties with conflicting opinions on Vijaya’s eligibility. With the charge transfer meeting to be held on 2nd May, we look forward to the conclusion of “Musical Chairs: Who sits when the music stops?”",
      "Note : This draft is the conclusion to the Musical Chairs Part 1 and Part 2",
      "On the 2nd of May, 2024,  the Students’ Senate reconvened. The proceedings commenced with Prashant declaring that Vijaya could no longer serve as the chairperson on the grounds of academic ineligibility. Subsequently, in order to facilitate the charge transfer, an officiating chairperson was appointed. Kinshuk Siyol, Senator BT/BS-MT/MS/MBA/MDes Y20, was elected for the position through a majority vote from the incoming Senate members.",
      "Following that, end term report presentation and charge transfer process took place for other executives :",
      "Mr. Kinshuk Siyol, (Officiating) Chairperson Students’ Senate",
      "Mr. Dhruv Misra, President, Students’ Gymkhana",
      "Mr Vaibhav Kadiyan, General Secretary, Games and Sports",
      "Mr Lakshay Gupta, General Secretary, Media and Culture",
      "Mr Hardik Agarwal, General Secretary, Science and Technology",
      "Mr Utkarsh Gupta, General Secretary UG, Academics and Career",
      "Mr. Yogesh Ram Gopal Singh, General Secretary PG, Academics and Career",
      "Mr. Srijan Kumar, Finance Convener, Students’ Senate",
      "Mr. Chiranshu Kataria, Convener, CoSHA",
      "As the round of Musical Chairs concludes and the new executives assume theircharge, the (Officiating) Chairperson is expected to conduct the re-elections for the post of Chairperson of the Students’ Senate soon.",

      "“Galaxy,” the renowned interhall cultural championship, is a pivotal component of the annual General Championship hosted by the Gymkhana at IIT Kanpur. It stands as a testament to the multifaceted talents present within the clubs of the Media and Cultural Council (MnC) while also serving as a talent scouting ground for exceptional individuals for the inter-IIT Cult Meet. Galaxy offers a dynamic platform for students to showcase their creativity, skills, and passions through a diverse range of competitions. This event not only encourages enthusiastic participation from freshers but also provides them with an immersive introduction to the rich cultural tapestry of IIT Kanpur.",
      "This year, the MnC council conducted its 39th Edition of Galaxy from 29th January 2024 to 12th February 2024.",
      "5 Pools participated in this competition, namely,  Aryans,  Nawabs, Kshatriyas, Peshwas and Shauryas.",
      "In the 9th special meeting of the Student’s Senate on 20th March 2024, the “Post Conduction Report ”, (PCR) of Galaxy’24 was to be discussed, and recommendations were to be provided. Usually, after the post-conduction report is passed, the results are formally announced, and the event comes to a formal end.",
      "Theofficial standingsof the pools according to the post-conduction report presented by the MnC Council in the Senate were :",
      "However, the post-conduction report was not passed in the Senate by a“majority”vote, and thus Galaxy’24 was scrapped.",
      "This trend of various events within the General Championship, such as Takneek and Galaxy, being scrapped for various reasons, has been observed for the past 2-3 years.In this article, we’ve explored a range of viewpoints and reasons behind the decision to scrap Galaxy’ 24, including perspectives from various stakeholders. We’ve also delved into the potential effects of this decision.",
      "The ultimate decision of whether Galaxy should be scrapped lies in the Students’ Senate’s hands. We talked with Prashant Mishra, the current Chairperson, Students’ Senate for the tenure 2023-24. Prashant emphasised that one of the significant reasons for Galaxy being scrapped is that halls are too obsessed with the tag and don’t want another hall to win it;",
      "“The root cause lies in how easy it is to invalidate the GC results at the end through the voting mechanism. Rationality and discussions hold no weight at the end. It’s so visible that every time, 4 pools will not win and only 1 would, the 4 or even fewer could just gang up to invalidate things through voting,cause no one comes to actually discuss things at the Senate Hall, but they come prepared with votes.” ~Prashant Mishra, Chairperson, Students’ (2023-24).",
      "Prashant further added that no event is perfect, and there are some flaws in every major event, but that doesn’t mean we should scrap the entire competition. He stated that“ there were no major blunders this time.”",
      "When asked what transpired in the Senate on the eve Galaxy was scrapped, Nitin Kumar, Institute Secretary, MnC, said that the senate meeting was quite chaotic.",
      "“Some pools came with clear intention  to scrap Galaxy and a few others wanted to defend, which resulted in chaos. We (Chairperson, President as well as the MnC core team) tried to have a proper discussion, but they all were not interested in listening and were just shouting. It was complete chaos so nothing we said mattered.” ~ Nitin Kumar, IS, MnC council",
      "Anjali Pandey, pool captain of Shauryas and Mayank Shekhar, pool captain of Aryans also reflected that there was not enough time provided to give clarifications. Without checking the credibility of claims made, voting was called too soon. Both of them added that technically, the pools weren’t allowed to raise contention in the Senate meeting since the deadline for raising it had already passed, but due to pressure from GBM, the contentions were taken up.",
      "In interviews with pool captains, a critical issue that emerged as a leading cause for the cancellation of Galaxy’24 was due to confusion on the part of the organising team, resulting in a mistaken swap of Hall 11 and Hall 7 between the Kshatriyas and Peshwas.",
      "However, Kaustubh Agarwal, General Secretary, MnC, clarified that this problem was acknowledged and resolved earlier in the pool captains meeting itself.",
      "Among the issues raised in the senate regarding Galaxy, a lot of them expressed concerns against the decision of the SGRC and GRC. Student Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) is constituted so that any grievances not solved by the organising team shall go to the SGRC. The SGRC comprised the following members, one from each pool:",
      "The Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) is constituted so that any grievances not solved by the organising team and SGRC shall go to the GRC. The GRC comprises of the following:",
      "According to the Pre conduction report of Galaxy, which was passed in the Senate,“the decision of GRC will be final; no reinvestigation related concerns shall be addressed further.”",
      "The SGRC considered seven contentions received via Google form floated.Notably, the contention regarding swapping of halls 7 and 11  was not one of the contentions. After deliberating on all the contentions, the positions of pools Aryans and Nawabs in the results were exchanged, with Aryans moving to 2nd place and Nawabs to 3rd. We further discussed this matter with committee members:",
      "According to Sheeshram, Sanmati and Nishi, members of SGRC had a calm and unbiased discussion on all the contentions, and unanimous decisions were taken by them.",
      "“Decisions were made on a rational basis, in reference to Pre Conduction Report as well as consultation with respective individuals if required.”~ Sanmati Pande, member of the SGRC",
      "Ayush Anand had a contrasting opinion regarding this. He felt that there existed a Hall Bias within SGRC. He pointed out that while the Pool captain of Nawabs had requested the opportunity to explain their side of the story in the contention document, they were not given the chance. In contrast, an individual from Pool Aryans, other than the pool captain, who had not explicitly requested a chance to provide clarification in the contention document, was afforded the opportunity to provide clarifications.",
      "“If every contention was discussed  properly , the standings would have remained the same. But logic took a backseat even in the SGRC meet.” ~ Ayush Anand, member of the SGRC",
      "The Pool Captain of Nawabs, Mukul Saini, also had issues with SGRC and GRC. He said that committees have been given excessive power, which can be used to change decisions and results without considering the opinion of MnC Gensec or Pool Captains. He believed that because the members of SGRC and GRC had no relation with the MnC Council, they did not have the expertise to deal with the contentions of Galaxy.",
      "Similarly, some members of the organizing committee contended that the senators lacked a comprehensive understanding of Galaxy, and therefore could not fairly determine whether Galaxy should be scrapped or not.",
      "As per Kaustubh, the SGRC is passed by the senate itself and thus is expected to be unbiased. He added that the contention filed is supposed to contain all the details required, and if further clarifications are needed, then SGRC contacts the core team and the pool captains.",
      "“The purpose of SGRC and GRC is to get an unbiased third perspective. If members of  these committees would be the MnC council core team themselves, then it would be no different from the pool captain meets.” ~ Kaustubh Agarwal, General Secretary, MnC.",
      "Some pool captains also cast doubt upon GRC, claiming that the professors are generally unaware, and essentially, the decision then rests with the Chairperson and President, who may have their own biases. Countering this, Kaustubh reiterated that the contention is supposed to contain the complete details; hence, like the SGRC, the GRC committee members are well informed, and then they come to a decision based on the facts presented.",
      "A clear divide seemed to be present in the viewpoint of the halls, with the Shauryas and Aryans on one side and the Nawabs, Peshwas and Kshatriyas on the other; however, one thing which was universally acknowledged was the waste of effort of the junior batches, especially the Y23 freshers.",
      "The pool captain of Nawabs, Mukul Saini, felt that there was a lot of bias in the conduction of events. He further added that “while some contentions had already been resolved and agreed to in the pool cap meets, the decisions were altered once they were raised in the SGRC.”",
      "“The major reason for scrapping Galaxy was lack of transparency in conduction and the biases of the organizing committee in some selective events” ~Gagan Kumar, pool captain of Peshwas",
      "However, Pool Aryans and Shauryas emphasized that all concerns had been thoroughly discussed, and they asserted that the other halls altered their statements during the Senate meeting.They also expressed regret over the growing hall divide and highlighted thatsenators often act solely as representatives of their respective halls.",
      "We sought the perspective of the organising team regarding the event as a whole. The core team members acknowledged their error in communication regarding the PG Hall Swapping. Despite attempting to address the issue during the pool captains’ meeting, after extensive deliberation, they collectively concluded that there was no feasible solution available, thus opting to move forward.",
      "Nitin Kumar, the Institute Secretary of the MnC Council, pointed out a crucial misunderstanding among certain pool participants regarding the subjective nature of cultural events. He mentioned that the Pre Conduction Report had been thoroughly discussed and presented to the Senate four days prior without any objections initially. However, objections in PCR arose later from the same individuals following their defeat.",
      "“The core team consists of 4 Members – 1 from Hall 3, 1 from Hall 12 and 2 from Hall 2, so the allegation of being biased towards Hall 6 or Hall 3 makes  no sense.” ~ Nitin Kumar, IS",
      "When asked about the absence of minutes of the pool captains’ meet, Nitin argued that there was no mandate about having minutes, and they made it clear in the meet itself that they are not maintaining minutes. The primary reason for that was the meetings were too long and chaotic, making it challenging to write minutes. However, he also suggests that minutes should be maintained from the next edition to prevent people from changing their statements later on.",
      "Several pool captains, as well as members of the organising committee and the SGRC, acknowledged that the efforts of over a thousand students of all halls were wasted.",
      "“Lot of juniors worked in Galaxy despite their quizzes, labs; yet they got no recognition; this will lead to a steep decrease in participation” ~ Aryan Prajapati,Cultural Secretary of Hall 2",
      "According to Anjali, this year’s Galaxy was especially important for Shauryas, who won for the first time in history.",
      "“ The participants had also invested in personal money for the event and the scrap had left them feeling disheartened. Students had given day and night for this event and some even broke down when they found out that their efforts will not be recognised.” ~ Anjali Pandey, Pool Captain, Shauryas.",
      "“Even the organising committee gets demotivated because even after investing a lot of time and effort, if the event gets scrapped without any concrete reasons then they have no scope of improvement in the upcoming tenure too and this trend of scraping would simply continue.” ~Kaustubh Agarwal, GenSec, MnC",
      "After Galaxy was scrapped, various proposals were made by the senators and the Chairperson on the senate list suggesting measures that could avoid the scrapping of GC in future. While such deliberations are underway it is to be noted that no rule is infallible, and if people are bent on misusing them, they would find one way or another.",
      "Pratyush Rai, the last Students’ Gymkhana President under whom the GC results were passed, said that it was saddening to hear about the Galaxy scrap, as it’s disheartening to the participating students who have put in so much effort.",
      "He stressed that it is imperative on the part of the organisers (i.e. Pool Leadership, Senate and Gymkhana) to ensure that conclusive results are shared. He highlighted that not sharing the final results leads to a public message of unprofessional conduct on the part of the organisers, as it indicates that we were not able to conduct one of the main Gymkhana events in a fair and impartial manner.",
      "He stated that historically, Gymkhana always tried its best to make sure that disputes are sorted during pool meets itself and senate-level discussions are avoided as pools typically have the most context of these matters and not the senate.",
      "“Hall culture reviving is a major win; it should be cherished.It leads to Mentorship, relationships for life; however, it should be maintained that it does not enter the Senate or Gymkhana politics.”",
      "~ Pratyush Rai, President Students’ Gymkhana (2018-19)",

      "In this piece, Vox delves into the intricacies of SnT teams’ funding, organisational structure, and workspace challenges faced by them. It highlights the disparities between current regulations and operational reality while also examining potential solutions and alternative models adopted by other IITs. To provide a well-rounded perspective, our investigation included consultations with the teams themselves, the core team members of the SnT council, administrative officials, faculty advisors, and teams from other IITs.",
      "Teams from IIT Kanpur have the chance to showcase the institute’s engineering and technical excellence on both national and international platforms through various competitions. Competitions are an opportunity for these teams to show the world what students of IIT Kanpur are truly capable of.",
      "Moreover, these teams actively contribute to academic research. According to Prof. Indranil Saha, Faculty Advisor for Team ERA and Team AUV, the experience gained by these teams in competitions enables them to contribute to externally funded research projects. The experimental setups created by the teams for testing their models become valuable resources for researchers, bridging the gap between undergraduate students and academic research. Additionally, working on competition problems exposes teams to practical applications of theoretical analysis, empowering them to enhance existing methods and address gaps, essentially contributing to systems research.",
      "While SnT teams actively participate in various competitions, there’s untapped potential for securing more prizes in prestigious national and international events. We still have a long way to go to develop something of global recognition, such as an internationally acclaimedhyperloop by IITM. In a candid discussion with various SnT teams, Vox uncovered the aspirations, challenges, and recurring issues hindering their progress.",
      "In October 2023, the teams secured a funding of 44 lakhs from the institute, following extensive efforts led by the SnT core team and the administration.",
      "However, it must be noted that in this period teams did receive funding from external sources through CSR and sponsorship deals. For example, in March 2023 teams received a combined funding of around 16 lakhs from a company called Noccarc but that was not enough for many.",
      "This is what the teams said in their interviews-",
      "“Teams lack long-term funding plans and rely on short-term bursts of income.”“Limited funds restrict participation in competitions”–  Atulya, Team Head, Aerial Robotics",
      "“The team has existing functioning hardware but lacks funds to build new hardware and participate in competitions.”– Kushal, ex-Team Head, AUV",
      "“We had financial problems until October 2023. Although we have enough money now, it will only last for a few months. Hence, we are looking for another round of funding so that we can establish ourselves to get sponsorships”– Emaad, Team Head, ERA",
      "“Insufficient funds have caused delays in the timeline for building the car.”“Paperwork is difficult and time-consuming due to strict auditing rules and logistics.”– Anchit, Team Head, IITKMS",
      "“Shortage of resources puts us at a disadvantage compared to other institutions that can freely build robots without hardware constraints. In contrast, we must operate within budget constraints, resulting in the need to build robots under limiting hardware conditions.”– Aadvik, Team Head, Humanoid",
      "Although the problem of funding has been temporarily solved, the challenge lies in the absence of a continuous funding pipeline for the teams, as a 44 lakh grant from the institute might not be a recurring source.",
      "The Current Funding Mandate",
      "In the interviews, some team members pointed fingers at the SnT core team, contending that the council does not actively pursue funds for teams within the yearly gymkhana budget. This stands in contrast to the systematic yearly allocation of funds to clubs and societies, fostering a perception of discrimination towards the teams.",
      "In response to these claims, Nishi Mehta, the Institute Secretary, Teams and Research of the SnT council, clarifies that their mandate doesn’t encompass funding teams. He explained that while clubs and societies, cater to the broader student community as open-to-all entities, teams operate differently. Teams are more focused and exclusive, with specific goals such as building robots or winning competitions and hence operating as closed groups. As clubs and societies cater to the broader student community, they are liable to receive the gymkhana funds obtained from students’ fees, but teams, being closed groups, are not.",
      "According to him, the council is committed to providing support instead of directly funding them. Financing multiple teams becomes a challenge, especially when the requirements of a single team surpass the entire SnT council budget. For instance, the SnT council’s gymkhana budget for this term amounted to approximately13 lakhs, whereas the proposed budget for Team ERA alone was around18 lakhs.",
      "TheConstitution of the Students’ Gymkhanamentions this in Chapter V, Article 23, wherein it states –",
      "“Teams shall be approved by the Senate on the recommendation of an Executive only if they have a validated source of funds. They shallnotbe allowed to use any funds from the Gymkhana.”",
      "This clarifies that the responsibility for acquiring funds, managing logistics, and handling operations rests entirely on the teams, rather than on the council. This is further emphasized in the PoR handbook where it’s mentioned that teams are recommended to have non-technical heads of finance, marketing and media.",
      "However, as an initiative, the SnT Council, in its past tenures, created a concept of “Council Projects”, through which teams could initiate projects with its team members, and the Council would provide a seed fund that teams could use to proceed with the projects they proposed, either partially or completely. The Council only limited the funds to projects and not the wider aim of the teams – to participate in competitions nationally or internationally.IITK Rocketry and Space Exploration Team (IITK-RaSET) is one such council project.",
      "What does the Administration Think About Teams’ Funding?",
      "To understand the administration’s perspective on funding for teams, we talked to theDean of Resources & Alumni (DoRA), Prof. Kantesh Balani.",
      "He explained to us that over the years, the extramural government grants have been reduced given that the older IITs have shown their capability to raise additional resources through CSR, projects, patents, and other alumni funding. The funding from the government is provided through loans for undertaking infrastructure projects like establishment of new laboratories and purchase of high-end research equipment, etc. To foster industry-academia collaboration, the government has launched a plethora of schemes with participation from the industry, with bridge funding by the government.",
      "An inference from this shift in the economics of our institute is that while student bodies like SnT Teams can obtain some additional funding from the institute, teams must also focus on external sources from the industry.",
      "However, the he told us that when a group of students come up with an idea to participate in a prestigious competition by working on cutting-edge technology, the institute can support from internal resources and/or solicit support from potential donors, which may assist them in developing the initial prototype.",
      "He emphasized that it is important for a team to have a long-term and sustainable plan that ensures healthy progress towards competitions instead of a one-tenure annual plan. He believed that this long-term planning would create the possibility to get funding throughfixed endowments from the institute’s donors. However, he also mentioned that short-term plans (any urgent need of funds, say to buy hardware or travel abroad) would require extra efforts. According to him, teams should market their progress to visitors, alumni, and external funding sources and look for sponsors, and be a synergistic factor in securing funds for the institute. The most probable sources of money would be through CSR, Alumni, and corporations looking to fund research in their interest areas.",
      "According to him, it is imperative to recognize that securing funding is a vital aspect of running a team, complementing their engineering and research efforts. A collaborative effort is needed to secure funding, as the technical team possesses in-depth knowledge about the intricacies of their technical work and an effective program/proposal can be packaged by IITK Development Office to the right donors to support the cause.",
      "“Teams shallnotbe a part of any other entity under the Gymkhana and shall be headed by one or more Captains appointed by the Senate.”– Chapter V, Article 24",
      "This rule indicates that teams cannot be a part of the organizational structure of SnT council but instead are a separate entity in the Gymkhana. This is more clearly shown in the Appendix D of Constitution of the Students’ Gymkhana where teams are not mentioned under the SnT council and in thePoR handbookon pages 15 and 25 where teams are described separately.",
      "However, there is an apparent contradiction between the legislative framework governing teams and observed reality. In the status quo, teams are considered as a part of the SnT council but according to the Student Gymkhana’s current legislature, they are not.",
      "The support SnT council provides to teams is not well defined and varies from tenure to tenure. This raises questions on the identity of teams and points out the unclear association between the council and the teams which majorly seems to depend on the discretion of the governing SnT core team.",
      "To understand possible alternative models, Vox contacted teams of other IITs from which teams of IITM and IITB responded.",
      "Organizational StructureTeam Raftaar, IITM’s Motorsport team has a 3-tier structure, with fourth-year students forming a core team at the top. In our discussion with a senior team member of Raftaar, we learned that the core team does the job of raising funds and ensuring that the team has access to resources and connections to the industry.",
      "We were told that while teams are supported financially byCenter For Innovationto some extent (CFI is IITM’s parallel body to the SnT Council), it is not enough, and every team is expected to have their own finance and logistics verticals to source deals.",
      "This is in contrast with our institute, where 4th year students don’t usually be a part of their teams and many of the teams do not extensively focus on finance & logistics.",
      "During our conversation with a member ofTeam AeRoVe at IITB, we learned thattechnical teams do not have parent student body like Gymkhana or CFI. Instead, teams are associated with an institute body called Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC).",
      "Financial Support from Administration/Gymkhana",
      "At IIT Madras, every team typically secure funding ranging from 4 to 7 lakhs per annum through the Gymkhana, facilitated by the Center for Innovation (CFI). Whereas at IIT Bombay, each team receives a funding of around 15 lakhs per annum through Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC), IITB.",
      "However, it’s noteworthy that teams at both institutions actively pursue additional funding from external sources. We were told that the IITB’s Racing team had a total corpus of ~5 Cr, while Team Agnirath at IITM, which was established in 2021, raised a funding of 1.5+ Cr.",
      "Industry Connect.A common factor that was mentioned in our interviews with teams’ heads was the relationships that teams have developed with companies through campus events and their alumni in associated sectors.",
      "One team head mentioned that one of the ways that they garnered visibility and marketed themselves to big sponsors was to go to events and startups in the Research Park of IITM. For example, Team Agnirath, a team that creates solar cars, managed to tap Reliance as their main sponsor by connecting with them at an energy conference. Teams also take the help of their faculty advisors’ industry contacts to get their foot in the door.",
      "OutreachWe were told that CFI has a dedicated managerial team spending its resources on maintaining outreach programs likeOpen House& Research Conclave, and regularly updated social media pages, giving a good public image to interested sponsors. Apart from marketing the teams’ work and building connections, these initiatives are beneficial in cases where donors are more willing to donate to institutional bodies than individual teams.",
      "We asked Nishi, IS Teams & Research about the outreach of SnT council. He told us that although we have an Outreach and Connect Wing it is very inactive.",
      "According tohttps://sntiitk.com/, the mandate of the wing the following –“Outreach & Connect Wing under SnT Council is responsible for building and sustaining Industrial, Research, and Alum collaborations of the council, gaining Projects and Sponsorships from them and passing them on to the Clubs/Teams/Hobby Groups under the Council, essentially being the centre of all the external affairs of the Council.”",
      "In the pursuit of innovation and problem-solving, teams often encounter a significant obstacle: the lack of adequate workspace. From managing inventory to collaborating effectively, the absence of a dedicated and permanent area proves to be a recurring obstacle for many.",
      "Some teams like Aerial Robotics and AUV are have a designated room in the Halls of Residences. Team Motorsports has its workspace right next to MT and also works at the central workshop. Teams like Team ERA, Humanoid and Vision often work in the labs assigned to their faculty advisor or a temporary workspace that they get through similar recommendations on an ad-hoc basis.",
      "“We currently have no workspace causing unnecessary delays and loss of productivity”  –Team ERA",
      "However, these arrangements, while functional, do not fully address the limitations concerning space for inventory, development and testing as multiple teams still face space issues. As a result, they do not adequately facilitate the collaborative and innovative atmosphere required for cutting-edge research and development.",
      "One notable facility is theSudha and Shankar Innovation Hubat IITM.",
      "In this building, competition teams have a large spacious corridor on the ground floor where they can store their inventory, work on their projects and test their prototypes in a collective space.",
      "There are labs where teams conduct in-house experiments –  a 3D printing room and a server room that house one of the most powerful computing systems in their campus, second only to the main supercomputer at the computer center. These rooms assist in smooth conduction of high level simulations of the CFI teams.",
      "The first floor is allotted to hardware clubs and is shared with Nirmaan, a pre-incubator. Nirmaan acts as a conduit between the GBM and IIT Madras Research Park incubation cell, and further guides these groups to materialize their ideas into successful businesses.",
      "Here are some of the pictures –",
      "",
      "Currently on our campus, the Students’ Gymkhana has requested the administration to allocate permanent space for multiple clubs and teams in the Old-SAC building. An agreement has been reached with the administration. However, its implementation is still pending.",
      "The challenges faced by IIT Kanpur’s SnT Institute Teams, from funding shortages to organizational ambiguities and workspace constraints, highlight the complexities of student-driven innovation. While recent funding efforts provide a temporary solution, a sustainable financial model remains elusive. Clearer organizational structures and proactive fundraising strategies, as seen in models from institutions like IIT Madras and IIT Bombay, offer valuable insights for improvement.",
      "In navigating these challenges, collaboration and strategic planning are paramount. By leveraging industry connections, alumni support, and institutional resources, the teams can overcome obstacles and achieve greater success. Additionally, addressing workspace limitations is crucial for fostering an environment conducive to innovation and collaboration.",
      "Despite the hurdles, the potential for growth and recognition on national and international stages is evident. With determination and collective effort, SnT Teams can realize their aspirations and continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in science and technology.",

      "As has been the precedent in IITK’s history, a few students from our institute got selected for the prestigious Google Summer of Code 2023. Vox congratulates the selected students on their well-deserved success.",
      "GSoC is a global program by Google for university students to learn about and get involved in open source. It is a unique program where students are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the open-source community and provide guidance while they work on a real-world open-source project during their summer break.Projects cover many fields, including Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, Programming Languages, Robotics, Science, security, and many more.",
      "Read the full interview as five selected candidates shed light on their journey, motivation, and difficulties.The interviewees are Pratyush Ranjan(Y19), Mihir Mittal(Y21), Shrish Shete(Y21),Pranjal Bhardwaj(Y21) and Siddharth Pathak(Y21).",
      "Q. How did you come to know about GSOC? When did you start the journey?",
      "Pratyush, GSOC:I talked to a Y18 senior, Priydarshi Singh, who happened to be a PClub coordinator. I was also involved in an ACA project with a Y17 senior, which spiked my interest in terms of general development.",
      "Shrish, GSOC:I learned about GSOC from YouTube and started preparation two months before we needed to submit the proposal.",
      "Mihir, GSOC:I attended Pclub’s GSOC session, and from there, I got to know about it. Then, I started exploring the official website around January.",
      "Q. What was your motivation behind pursuing it?",
      "Pranjal, GSOC:I had that dream of clearing GSOC at the back of my mind from the very beginning. Also, everyone was doing something or other in college, which motivated me to do something.",
      "Shirish, GSOC:I was exposed to the R language, and one of our professors was a GSOC mentor. She motivated us to give GSOC a try.",
      "Siddharth, GSOC:I wanted to utilize my first summer and get some work experience. If I hadn’t gone through GSOC, I would’ve tried to get this experience some other way.",
      "Q. How did you prepare for it?",
      "Pratyush:One should start passively preparing for it in January, shortlist organizations, and contact the mentors via Slack or email before the organizations get declared.",
      "Siddharth:I have done courses in the R language. So, I specifically focused on R and R-based communities.",
      "Mihir:I shortlisted the organizations in February. I’ll suggest getting help from relevant seniors. They can guide you very well.",
      "Q. How did the Institute help you achieve this success?",
      "Siddharth, GSOC:As I am from the SDS department, I was taught basic Python and R in my courses, which helped me a lot. This led me to choose a project in the R language.",
      "Pranjal, GSOC:Shivam (senior, IITK) solved my doubts and even reviewed my proposal. He also suggested that I switch when there was no progress at a particular organization.",
      "Q. What did you do in moments of frustration or when there was no progress?",
      "Mihir, GSOC:Many times, we write code without understanding it because there are many open sources. The more important thing is to understand the code rather than copying it.",
      "Pratyush, GSOC:Sometimes, I was just resolving bugs for 30 days. It was frustrating. I remember that during that time, I read a lot. I had some 100 tabs open in my browser, and often, solutions to most of the complex bugs turned out to be just going back to fundamentals",
      "Shrish, GSOC:I would say, Just keep on learning. There are moments when it seems no progress is being made, but if you grind through it, you will see results.",
      "Q. What was your reaction when the news broke? How did you celebrate?",
      "Shrish, GSOC:I was travelling back home when the result was declared. I could not sleep and bought some chocolates once I got down to the station. I did not get any sleep that night!",
      "Pranjal, GSOC:I had already accepted the fact that I couldn’t go through this time, so the selection was a surprise. I called my grandmother and a few relatives to share the news.",
      "Siddharth, GSOC:My mentor informed me two days prior that the proposal was accepted. So I was not very surprised, but the celebrations are still due.",
      "Q. Any comments on the Indian coding culture?",
      "Shrish, GSOC:I feel like open source is not well explored in India. More people should work on it, as it has lots of opportunities.",
      "Pranjal, GSOC:I have heard that people start very late in India, but it is also true that there have been many GSOC contributors and even many ICPC achievers from India.",
      "Pratyush, GSOC:I feel like the software development jobs field is oversaturated. The companies tend to take DSA tests first for all kinds of roles, which I believe is not required and shouldn’t be the only parameter.",
      "Q. How was your mentor-mentee relationship?",
      "Mihir, GSOC:My mentor was highly responsive. He would even respond today if I had any doubts.",
      "Siddharth, GSOC:My mentor,Prof. Dootika, was very helpful. She always answered promptly and didn’t ever put any hard deadlines on me.",
      "Shrish, GSOC:It was nice. At first, they were very formal, but pretty soon they opened up and even talked about their universities.",
      "Q. Do any of your family members, especially your parents, know how prestigious GSOC is?",
      "All interviewees:All they knew was that I was doing some project or internship for Google, which pays well, and they were happy when they got the news.",
      "Q. How sure were you that you’d get into GSOC?",
      "Pratyush, GSOC:For the first time, I was not that confident, as many people worked a lot but still weren’t able to go through.",
      "Siddharth, GSOC:I saw the proposals for my competition, and they were very abstract. So, I developed some confidence in my selection.",
      "Pranjal, GSOC:Some people had already coded the project at the time we were only submitting proposals. So, that was a little demotivating.",

The director mentioned that they can meet again after 15 days, after the 5-member committee meets and discusses.",
      "Time 5:45 PM",
      "A student tells about the monthly complaints received in the gender cell by PG students, and no action can be taken because students are afraid to register formal complaints. Students continue sharing their grievances. The administrative heads continue hearing the grievances with limited response. A student asks about the result of previous cases happened in campus, to which the director responds that they are under investigation.",
      "Time 5:40 PM",
      "A student asked about the absence of members, particularly DoIP’s presence in HMC meetings, and many meetings have happened without DoIP. The director responded that DoIP has met with all wardens about the same. He also said that he would look into the housing conditions of the students. The director agreed on the addition of special questions in the faculty feedback form, which would be directly sent to the ombuds group on a student’s demand.",
      "Time 5:35 PM",
      "The director did not respond to the iterative demand for the addition of an external person to the Ombuds group. However, after multiple demands, he said he would put this point forward. On the question of poor performance by a whole batch and 30 terminations from 150 strength in the first semester of the MBA, the director said he would talk with the department and is aware of the issue. The director also agreed to make the minutes public of the 5 member committee.",
      "Time 5:30 PM",
      "Students also share their anecdotal experiences with professors with the director. Problems like professors’ poor conduct and degree extensions are being discussed with the director.",
      "Time 5:25 PM",
      "Students demanded that faculty members who are not considerate (from SRS) should not be allowed in any position of power. The director welcomed it as a good suggestion and said he would take care of it. On the need for the administration to know the students’ problems, the director replied that he has talked with departments, and they need to know the problems of students. On the question, about a professor’s presence and conduct in the termination committee of a demised student, the director said he would talk with the department heads about the same.",
      "Time 5:20 PM",
      "On the question of the rude treatment by the professors and office staff, the director said that they would talk with the dean’s office and sensitize them. He asked students to let him know of any such incidents. A student asked about the lack of rules for faculty. The director replied that they discuss the code of conduct with the faculty on the onboarding. However, no response was received to the demand for paper rules for faculty.",
      "Time 5:15 PM",
      "A student asked whether a mechanism exists for the administration to understand students’ needs. The director responded that this is one of the primary works of the 5 member committee that the institute is proposing. The current mechanism involves HoD, supervisor, and warden, which does not allow us to express our problems freely. The director responded that such a mechanism would be implemented. After multiple requests, the director agreed to have a similar open session on the committee’s progress. On the question of the excessive power of guides, the Director responded, with the point of existence of an Ombuds Group.",
      "Time 5:10 PM",
      "Regarding more counsellors, the director says that they have increased 4 positions. The institute feels that this needs to be done. They are discussing the mental therapy reimbursement with the insurance company. The director is now addressing students’ individual questions. On the question of external members for Ombuds, the director said the committee would decide in 15 days. On questioning about the need for 15 days for an official decision, the director responded that these are structural changes and he alone can’t make decision on them.",
      "Time 5:05 PM",
      "On whether a thesis supervisor will be answerable if a student’s thesis is not completed within 5 years, the director says that the DMC will be taking care of such cases. On many other demands, the director has agreed to get back to us with a structure in 15 days. On the demand of PhD exit with MTech or MSR, the director promises to come up with their work in the next senate meeting. Upon reinstatement of the terminated students, the director says that they will do whatever is best that can be done. The institute will introduce a new course on mental health in the next semester.",
      "Time 5:00 PM",
      "On the demand of a DG-level external officer and automatic complaints redressal, the director said that they are working on it and the students will get to know the decision within 15 days.",
      "Time 4:55 PM",
      "The director welcomed the demand for a faculty sensitisation program. The director said that they have constituted a 5 member committee to decrease stress among students.

      "The sight of tossed dustbins, scattered waste, and torn sanitary pads has become all too familiar for campus residents. Dogs have been found on various floors of residential halls in search of food. Incidents of destroyed belongings, including bitten shoes and damaged clothing, are rising. Some areas have witnessed aggressive dogs chasing campus residents, leading to injuries or dog bites. Some students have further mentioned how this affected their academics. Additionally, the incessant barking of dogs has become a source of significant nuisance. These dog behaviours can be observed in different pockets of the campus.",
      "",
      "The history of the relationship between humans and animals spans a broad spectrum, from companionship to parasitism. Often when we think about animals and companionship, dogs come first to mind. However, the issue of stray dogs is a global concern, and our campus is no exception. This article focuses on the coexistence of two different categories of living beings.  Vox delves into this complex issue in this investigative report, speaking with students, administration, and key stakeholders.",
      "",
      "The campus community can be broadly categorised into three groups based on their opinion on the issue, as observed by our team. The first includes people who have a soft spot for dogs. They oppose the removal of dogs from hall premises and propose alternative solutions, such as creating designated feeding zones, installing gates on staircases, individual adoption of dogs, protective cover and lifting of the waste bins, and conducting sensitisation campaigns within the campus community. They also encourage methods, like spraying water, to discourage dogs from specific areas. Some individuals actively volunteer to care for the dogs, monitoring their behaviour and promoting awareness through posters and educational campaigns. They further help with the smooth conduction of the sterilisation drive, as they act as a trusted entity for the dogs.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The second group believes that removing dogs from residential areas is essential, as their presence disrupts routine activities and raises concerns about safety, hygiene and comfort. According to one HEC member, many residents fear the dogs, who sometimes enter rooms and create a mess. The constant littering also places additional burdens on sanitation efforts, and some halls have taken decisive action to remove dogs from the premises to mitigate these issues.",
      "",
      "",
      "The third group is the indifferent people. They do not hold strong opinions or are open to the suggested remedies. However, recent dog-related incidents have prompted many to reconsider their stance. For instance, 17 dog bites were reported to the Health Centre between 3rd June and 27th July 2023, even when a large section of the students weren’t on campus.",
      "",
      "",
      "Faced with these problems, several Hall Executive Committees (HECs) have taken measures to remove dogs from their respective halls. This decision to remove dogs in Hall 4 was made by surveying hall residents and considering the majority’s opinions.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "However, we do not\nintend to hurt any creature in this process. The dogs will be well taken care\nby the Animal Cell of IIT Kanpur, as informed by the wardens.Thanks and RegardsHEC Team\nHall-4, IIT Kanpur",
      "",
      "This initiative began with Hall 8 and was followed by Hall 4. However, the promised relocation to a safe shelter has fallen short, as dogs were often found outside the halls during the initial stage.",
      "This process of dog removal was later implemented in Hall 10, Hall 11, and GH1 around last year. This sudden removal created tension in the Chaupati area (new Mama Mio) as dogs identified it as a new food source, according to a volunteer.",
      "",
      "It’s important to note that dogs are territorial animals, which means they occupy and protect specific areas throughout their lives. According to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960, under section 38 of theAnimal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules 2001,dogs cannot be removed or relocated from their territory(Q11 in the doc). The prescribed method for capturing, sterilising, immunising, and releasing dogs involves specific steps:",
      "Reporting a nuisance or dog bite case to the nearest animal welfare organisation is to be taken care of on a priority basis.",
      "The organisation takes in a specific number of dogs under its care",
      "And releasing them back to the exact location.",
      "The process retains the original territory of dogs. In our campus context, the organisation responsible for undertaking the steps is the Animal Welfare Cell, IIT Kanpur (AWC).",
      "",
      "Ensuring peaceful coexistence between dogs and humans on campus has proven to be a significant challenge for both the administration and the student body. Established on December 31, 2018, the Animal Welfare Cell is tasked with enforcing the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals Act (PCA Act 1960). It collaborates with local authorities to protect animal rights and conducts sensitisation drives to maintain a balanced animal population within the campus, along with healthy cohabitation between humans and animals.",
      "The core members are a Chairperson, faculty advisors, local animal officers, and student nominees. Apart from them, the AWC also relies on its dedicated volunteers. These volunteers work diligently to minimise any harm caused by animal aggression or human interaction. They belong to the first school of thought, as mentioned above.",
      "During the two-year lockdown, sterilisation efforts within the campus were halted due to the absence of residents on campus, leading to a tremendous increase in the dog population. Despite a defunct period post-COVID, AWC has gotten active again recently in the current tenure.  It has resumed sterilisation efforts and is planning and organising sensitisation talks, the first of which took place on the 9th of October, 2023. Prof. Amit Mitra, the Chairperson of AWC, acknowledges the critical role of students in successful sterilisation drives.",
      "“Students are the integral part of the AWC, and any decision taken by AWC is brought into implementation only with their support; hence, they are given freedom, and for any decision, we try to actively involve both the student nominees in it.”-Prof. Amit Mitra",
      "",
      "The talk on the 9th of October this year was conducted by Dr. Anindita Bhadra, a behavioural biologist studying dogs under the Department of Biological Sciences of IISER Kolkata. She explained the science behind numerous stray dog behaviours in her talk and emphasised that “one must understand animal ecology before formulating relevant policies.”",
      "",
      "She also spoke about the aggressive behaviour of male dogs during the mating season and of female dogs when they have small pups, the role of male dogs in their upbringing, and the appropriate age for dogs to be adopted. She also explained how barking is the mark of reinforcing their territory.",
      "",
      "On the feeding habits of dogs, she said that dogs are scavengers by nature, and they eat what they get, be it through begging or rummaging in the dustbins. Dogs pick a resting site based on closeness to the food source, visibility (for security), and direct view of the feeding site. While creating the designated feeding sites, the two most essential things to be considered are the dog’s territory and the distance from the resting site. Excessive petting and feeding would lead the dogs to enter the residential premises, and she recommends avoiding these in the area used by the people to reside. It is also important not to over-feed the dogs at these sites, as excess resources breed competition and conflict. There are further mentions that the dogs will have to naturally shift to that “better” territory instead of forceful eviction, which might lead to increased aggression.",
      "",
      "She later tells us the importance of sterilisation to strike a balance so that the population doesn’t die out, ending the talk by stating that “dogs have survived not because of dog lovers or haters, but because of neutral people.” She repeatedly emphasised that coexistence is mandatory and that both parties need adjustments to cohabitate. She further explains how adjustment doesn’t mean sharing your residential space but acknowledging that the land we share belongs to the dogs equally as it does to the humans.",
      "",
      "Beyond dogs, the campus is also home to a significant population of peacocks. Concerns have arisen that dogs may be hunting peacocks, leading to declining numbers. Eight such cases were reported between January 1st and June 9th, 2023, as reported by the SIS office. This suspicion is not new; in 2018, a similar decline in peacock numbers prompted speculation about dogs killing them. At that time, the decision was made to move dogs to two feeding zones, but subsequent research revealed the presence of the Newcastle Virus in the peacocks, which led to the death.",
      "",
      "In conclusion, the issue of aggressive dogs on campus is a multifaceted challenge that has gathered diverse opinions among the student body and administration. It raises concerns about safety, hygiene, and coexistence. As we’ve explored, some advocate for the rights of dogs and demand a healthy coexistence, while others emphasise the need to remove dogs to address their problems. The middle ground remains elusive, and the lines often blur between these stances. Legalities, campus sentiment, and the role of the Animal Welfare Cell all play a pivotal role in shaping the ongoing dialogue on this issue. Finding a balanced and sustainable solution that ensures both the welfare of dogs and the well-being of the campus community is undoubtedly a complex task. As discussions continue, it is clear that fostering understanding, cooperation, and empathy among all stakeholders will be essential to resolving this challenging situation.",

      "The IITK community is diverse in terms of language origins. When speakers of varied languages interact, we often experience a barrier to open and free communication. First day of orientation and not understanding what the SGs just blabbered in Hindi. First day of classes, understanding the professor’s English was a bigger hurdle than understanding the course itself. We at Vox, tried to analyze theselanguage barrierson campus within the academic and co-curricular spheres. Read ahead to see what we found.",
      "343 students responded to our survey concerning the language barriers on campus conducted in July 2023. The following infographics depict their language backgrounds and the language they used to complete their board examinations. We see that this gives us the context required. A majority is comfortable with Hindi and English, but what about the students who do not fall into this category? What is being done? Is that sufficient and helpful? What more can be done by the various stakeholders? These are a few questions that we’ve tried to get answers to through this article.",
      "While a majority is fully to fairly comfortable, almost 10% of the students are not comfortable with English, the official medium of instruction in the institute. We further see that 19.8% of the respondents cannot interact with professors, and 9.3% face difficulty understanding lectures because of their inability to communicate confidently in English. These numbers are not mere stats, but represent a harsh reality. With a difficult curriculum like ours, such barriers can make learning almost impossible, and difficult for students to keep up with their peers.",
      "On talking to various professors, we found something similar. Some professors mention that during courses, some students either approach them with difficulty following the course content because it is in English or with a general problem in speaking and understanding English, which could lead to them feeling inferior in their peer groups. The professors, especially those taking English courses(like ELC and ENG), are supportive and suggest movies and books to the students. Some professors also told us that a few of them, especially the ones teaching English courses, suggest movies and books to better cope with English.",
      "Various respondents mention that they fear participating in academic discussions because they lack the confidence to word their thoughts in English. The institute introduced the English Language Courses (ELC 111/112/113) for Y22s in lieu of the previous ENG 112 and COM200 courses aimed at improving proficiency and communication skills in English. However, the effectiveness of these courses is put into question as 57.2% of the respondents (166) who took ELC/ENG courses believe it to be of little or no help in improving their proficiency with the language. Moreover, many mention that the ELC course allotted to them through the English Diagnostic Test, especially ELC113(Advanced), was a surprise because their English is not up to the standard. Even for the COM200 courses, an astounding 72.09% of the respondents(157) who took the course opted for the option “it was a complete waste of my time.”",
      "A few professors agree that there is a limitation of how much of a difference an English course in the curriculum can make for a student. They believe that support from the student community can have a more significant impact. One more observation they pointed out was that the ELC courses (formerly ENG112) offered to help students struggling with English run parallel with the rest of the courses. This is extremely tough on students with a poor grasp of English. They are now expected to comprehend the content and present answers in college-level English in other courses while simultaneously learning the language basics. By the time they get a good grasp on English, most of their semester is already done and dusted, placing them at a disadvantage academically.",
      "The dearth of a suitable environment to practice English is also part of the problem, as many respondents mention in their individual experiences. Ironically, some cite that the TAs and tutors usually stick to Hindi while instructing, unfurling issues for the section of the student community uncomfortable with Hindi.",
      "When asked whether the introduction of courses in regional languages would be beneficial, some professors mentioned that the struggle to work with English is one that cannot be avoided. English is the language of the world today, and in their professional life, students will have to work with it. By taking the lectures in Hindi or mixing Hindi and English, some professors feel that they are not only compromising the institution’s standard of teaching but also delaying the students’ struggle, which they have to face eventually.",
      "Another vital aspect affected by these language barriers is the social life of students. 16% of the respondents mentioned that they couldn’t participate in various club activities because of this, while another 18.1% faced difficulty in even making friends. This results in a barrier to understanding and speaking both Hindi and English fluently.",
      "15.5% of the respondents have little to no comfort with the Hindi language. The inability to interact fluently in Hindi unfurls another set of issues. A common problem mentioned by the respondents is that the mess workers, maintenance staff, etc., speak only in Hindi. Several also said they have difficulty interacting with new people and participating in campus activities as they are usually conducted in Hindi. Sharah PS, a Malayalam-speaking UG Y22, shares her experience of how she has to take a Hindi-fluent friend with her whenever she has to interact with shopkeepers. Even with some of her friends, it becomes difficult to converse as she can only reply in English. Adding on, she mentions that initially, some people were worse off than her and could have used some help. Another respondent mentions an incident where they went to inquire about a government scheme, and the official asked them to respond only in Hindi.“Even after explaining that we could not, the official told us to learn Hindi, bringing it up multiple times and joking about it.”",
      "Earlier, there were two ways in which students facing difficulties with English were given support. One was the formal help given, which consisted of courses, namely ENG112 and COM200. The other was the unofficial programs, including spoken English classes conducted by DoSA, TTC(Technical Terminology Classes), and ECC(English Communication Classes) conducted by the Institute Counseling Service (ICS).",
      "ENG112 was allocated to students based on their performance in the English Diagnostic Test conducted during the orientation. It was an extra course. Allotted students had to do it when the other students did their HSS Level 1 course. These students also had to do an HSS Level 1 course later. This led to a discrepancy in the student’s curriculum. Due to this, ENG112 was then made into an HSS Level 1 course. The curriculum for ENG112 was not fixed. It usually covered speaking, writing, listening, and reading, with the distribution varying from instructor to instructor. There was a COM200 course (till the Y21 batch), which all students had to take. There were various issues with that course, including the batch size being too big, diversity in proficiency among the students, and the time allotted for the course being insufficient to cover all the required aspects. There was also an issue of ownership of the course, with no department taking responsibility for offering the course for students who failed.",
      "In place of these courses, from the Y22 batch onwards, ELC111(Basic), ELC112(Intermediate), and ELC113(Advanced) have been introduced. Now, all students must take an English course in their first year. The level they have to take is determined by the English Diagnostic Test.However, the help that courses can provide is limited. This was recognized by the officials and the student body as the Institute Counseling service started offering TTC and ECC, and the DoSA started offering spoken English classes. These initiatives used to be of immense help to the students as they provided them with practical solutions. However, the spoken English classes by the DoSA stopped after the instructor who was taking the sessions left campus, and parallelly, the participation in the classes conducted by ICS decreased. Even the professors that we talked to noted this unwillingness of students to learn a new language. Some of them also suggested offering English courses before the start of the 1st semester, maybe in an extended orientation, so that students are better equipped to handle the other courses taught in English.",
      "Another aspect of communication courses prior to the introduction of the new UGARC was the department-level communication courses that aimed to teach students communication skills specific to their respective departments. For example, the Math department taught a course on presenting proofs, while the Electrical department’s communication course centered itself around resume-making, viva, and the likes. These department-level courses have also been discontinued with the Y22 batch, and the basket offered by ELC serves as a more comprehensive replacement. The efficacy of a new system/course is generally decided over 2-3 batches to eliminate special circumstances. Therefore, no significant change or impact of the courses can be looked at based on the feedback of a single batch.",
      "“However, while it is true that no system is by any means perfect, not all of its inefficacy falls on the administration. The efficacy of any system ultimately falls upon the people whom it serves to benefit, and ELC as a whole can only truly serve its purpose if the people who seek to improve their English communication skills truly participate and take its full benefit. Moreover, it is noteworthy that a higher-level ELC course can always be taken as an OE course by students who did a lower-level course previously and are interested in furthering their English communication skills,”said Kinshuk Siyol, student nominee to the Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC).",
      "Another mechanism available for students interested in working on their spoken/written English skills is offered by the Shivani Centre, which was set up in August 2021 with the aim of reintegratingHindi and other Indian Languages at IIT Kanpur.One of the objectives of Shivani Centre is to help fresher students who completed their schooling/JEE in Hindi adjust to a completely English academia. In addition, for students who are facing issues in interacting with their peers due to a lack of knowledge in Hindi, Shivani Centre offers spoken/written Hindi classes in varying proficiencies. For example, one can learn Hindi formally to the level of writing creative pieces or maybe just learn conversational Hindi to interact with their peers. Besides Hindi, the Shivani Centre also provides opportunities for students to learn other regional languages, such as Tamil, Kannada, or Malayalam.",
      "We also found that EPP, an English Proficiency Programme, used to be conducted for students who wanted to learn or improve their English. It was discontinued when the pandemic began. It was conceptualized and conducted by Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta with the help of some faculty members and the student body. The program helped diligent students write better English and perform better in the placement season, thus serving as a useful help for the student body.A group led by Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta is currently working towards reviving the program and is looking for volunteers to join the English team and the technical team,regarding which he will write to the students list shortly.",
      "In a nutshell, the language barriers on campus are real and affect students academically and socially. Despite continued efforts like the courses and support services, the barrier persists. Professors, student representatives, students seeking help, everyone agrees that there is a scope for improvement. Improvement here is not limited to the better resources and plans, but also in terms of a more enthusiastic participation by the students these efforts are for. As we see, it also calls for the need of the Campus Junta to be aware of such linguistic differences, and to deal with them empathetically. An attempt to understand and be more inclusive is required. These are not just numbers, but fellow students we see around us struggling. We are left to ponder about the smallest of attempts we can make for the betterment of the situation.",

      "आई आई टी कानपुर एक ऐसा शिक्षण संस्थान है जहां पर भाषागत विविधता आमतौर पर देखी जा सकती है।जब विभिन्न भाषाओं को बोलने वाले वक्ता बातचीत करते हैं, तब अक्सर वह खुले और मुक्त संचार में बाधा का अनुभव करते हैं। पहले दिन जब SGs हिंदी में कुछ बताते है या संवाद करते हैं और जब प्रोफेसर की अंग्रेजी समझना पाठ्यक्रम को समझने से भी बड़ी बाधा होती है। विस्तृत रूप से जानने के लिए हमारी VOX टीम ने शैक्षणिक और सह-पाठ्यचर्या क्षेत्रों के भीतर कैंपस में इन भाषा बाधाओं का विश्लेषण करने का प्रयास किया। हमें क्या मिला यह देखने के लिए आगे पढ़ें।",
      "परिसर में भाषा संबंधी बाधाओं से संबंधित हमारे सर्वेक्षण ( जो जुलाई 2023 में किया गया था ) में 343 छात्रों ने प्रतिक्रिया दी। निम्नलिखित इन्फोग्राफिक्स उनकी भाषा पृष्ठभूमि और उस भाषा को दर्शाते हैं जिसका उपयोग उन्होंने अपनी बोर्ड परीक्षाओं को पूरा करने के लिए किया था। इससे हमें उत्तरदाताओं की भाषा पृष्ठभूमि के बारे में कुछ जानकारी मिलती है और बाद के विश्लेषण के लिए भी जगह मिलती है। अधिकांश लोग हिंदी और अंग्रेजी में सहज हैं, लेकिन उन छात्रों के बारे में क्या जो इस श्रेणी में नहीं आते हैं? उनके लिए क्या प्रयास किए गए हैं? क्या यह पर्याप्त और सहायक है? इन समस्याओं से निजात पाने के लिए और क्या प्रयास किए जा सकते हैं? ये कुछ प्रश्न हैं जिनका उत्तर हमने इस लेख के माध्यम से पाने का प्रयास किया है।",
      "किये गए सर्वे के अनुसार विद्यार्थियों में भाषा को लेकर एक विभाजन निश्चित तौर पर देखा जा सकता है। ज्यादातर छात्रों को तो कोई खास दिक्कत नहीं है पर लगभग 10% छात्रों को अंग्रेजी के प्रयोग से दिक्कत है, जो इंस्टिट्यूट की औपचारिक भाषा है। अंग्रेजी में आत्मविश्वास से संवाद करने में उनकी असमर्थता के कारण, जिन्होंने सर्वे फॉर्म भरा था उनमें से लगभग 19.8% विद्यार्थी प्रोफेसर से बात करने में हिचकिचाते हैं और लगभग 9.3% विद्यार्थी लेक्चर समझने में मुश्किल महसूस करते हैं। ये आंकड़े महज़ आँकड़े नहीं हैं, बल्कि एक कड़वी हकीकत बयाँ करते हैं। हमारे जैसे कठिन पाठ्यक्रम के साथ, ऐसी बाधाएं सीखने को लगभग असंभव बना सकती हैं, और छात्रों के लिए अपने साथियों के साथ तालमेल बिठाना मुश्किल हो सकता है।",
      "अलग अलग प्रोफेसर्स से बात करने पर भी एक ही तरह की प्रतिक्रिया हमारे सामने आई। कुछ प्रोफेसर्स ने बताया की कुछ बच्चे हैं जो उनके पास अपनी परेशानी लेकर आये और उनको बताया कि उन्हे पाठ्यक्रम सामग्री को समझने में दिक्कत होती है क्योंकि वह अंग्रेजी में है और उनको अंग्रेजी बोलने और समझने में परेशानी होती है। जिसके कारण वह अपने आप को अपने साथियों से कमजोर महसूस करते हैं। प्रोफेसर्स जो अंग्रेजी कोर्सेज लेते हैं (जैसे कि  ELC और ENG)  काफी सहायक है। वे छात्रों को फ़िल्में और किताबें बताते हैं जो उन्हें बेहतर ढंग से अंग्रेजी समझने में सहायक होते हैं।",
      "कुछ विद्यार्थियों ने यह भी बताया कि अंग्रेजी में आत्मविश्वास न होने के कारण वे अकादमिक चर्चाओं में भाग लेने से भी कतराते हैं। संस्था ने ENG112 और COM200 के जगह पर Y22s के लिए English Language Course(ELC 111/112/113) को आरंभ किया था जिसकी प्रभावशीलता को लगभग 57.2% विद्यार्थियों ने अंग्रेजी सुधारने में अक्षम बताया है। ELC course सभी को English Diagnostic Test के माध्यम से बांटा जाता है। ELC113(Advanced) पाने वाले कुछ विद्यार्थियों ने आश्चर्य जताया है क्योंकि उनकी अंग्रेजी अच्छी न होने पर भी उन्हें ये कोर्स मिला है। COM200 लेने वाले विद्यार्थियों में से 72.09% (157) ने इस कोर्स को “समय की बर्बादी” बताया था।",
      "कुछ प्रोफेसर इस बात से सहमत हैं कि पाठ्यक्रम में एक अंग्रेजी पाठ्यक्रम, एक छात्र के लिए कितना अंतर ला सकता है, इसकी एक सीमा है। उनका मानना है कि छात्र समुदाय के भीतर से मिलने वाले समर्थन का अधिक प्रभाव हो सकता है। एक और अवलोकन जो उन्होंने बताया वह यह था कि ELC पाठ्यक्रम (पूर्व में ENG112) अंग्रेजी से जूझ रहे छात्रों को बाकी पाठ्यक्रमों के समानांतर चलने में मदद करने की कोशिश करते हैं। पर जो छात्र अंग्रेजी में कमजोर है और नई भाषा को सीख रहे हैं उनके लिए कॉलेज द्वारा पाठ्य सामग्री को अंग्रेजी में पढ़ना और अपने उत्तर को अंग्रेजी में प्रस्तुत करना कुछ हद तक कठिन हो जाता है। जब तक वे अंग्रेजी पर अच्छी पकड़ बनाते हैं, तब तक उनका अधिकांश सेमेस्टर समाप्त हो चुका होता है और वे शैक्षणिक रूप से नुकसान में रहते हैं।",
      "अंग्रेजी का अभ्यास करने के लिए उपयुक्त वातावरण की कमी भी समस्या का एक हिस्सा है, जैसा कि कई उत्तरदाताओं ने अपने व्यक्तिगत अनुभवों में उल्लेख किया है।यहां तक, कुछ ने तो ये भी बताया कि अक्सर TA और Tutors बात-चीत में हिंदी का प्रयोग करते थे जो कि उन विद्यार्थियों के लिए एक बाधा थी जिन्हें हिंदी नहीं आती थी।",
      "जब उनसे पूछा गया कि क्या क्षेत्रीय भाषाओं में पाठ्यक्रम शुरू करने से फायदा होगा? तबकुछ प्रोफेसर्स ने यह भी वर्णित किया कि अंग्रेजी में काम करने का संघर्ष ऐसा है जिसे टालना नामुमकिन हैं, क्योंकि अंग्रेजी आज दुनिया की भाषा है, और अपने व्यवस्यायी जीवन में विद्यार्थियों को इस भाषा के साथ काम करना होगा। हिंदी में लेक्चर लेने या हिंदी और अंग्रेजी को सयोंजकर लेक्चर लेने मे कुछ प्रोफेसरों को लगता है कि वे न केवल संस्थान के शिक्षण के स्तर से समझौता करेंगे, बल्कि वे छात्रों के उस संघर्ष में भी विलंब ला रहे हैं जिसका सामना उन्हें अंततः करना हैं।",
      "पढाई के अतिरिक्त, विद्यार्थियों को सामाजिक जीवन में भी भाषा रूपी बाधाओं का सामना करना पड़ता है। सर्वे में 16% बच्चों ने बताया कि इसके कारण उन्हें विभिन्न क्लब गतिविधियों में परेशानी का सामना करना पड़ता है व 18.1% को तो दोस्त बनाने में भी मुश्किल होती है।जिसका मुख्य कारण यह है कि हिंदी और अंग्रेजी दोनों को धाराप्रवाह समझने और बोलने में लोगों को समस्याओं का सामना करना पड़ता है।",
      "सर्वे में 15.5% उत्तरदाताओं ने हिंदी में असमर्थता व्यक्त की है। हिंदी में धाराप्रवाह बातचीत करने में असमर्थता कई अन्य समस्याओं को उजागर करती है। एक आम समस्या जो देखी गई है वो ये है कि mess workers और maintenance staff  सिर्फ हिंदी में ही बात करते हैं। कैंपस में होने वाली अधिकतर गतिविधियां भी हिंदी में ही होती हैं जिसके करण काफी लोग नए लोगों से बात करने में खुद को अक्षम पाते हैं। शाराह पी.एस., मलयालम बोलने वाली एक Y22 UG छात्रा ने बताया है कि कैसे उन्हें हर बार एक हिंदी में सहज मित्र को अपने साथ ले जाना पड़ता है ताकि वे दुकनदारों से बात कर सकें। यहां तक कि उन्हें अपने मित्रो से भी बात करने में मुश्किल होती है क्योंकि वे सिर्फ अंग्रेजी में ही उत्तर दे सकती हैं । एक उत्तरदाता ने तो ये भी बताया कि जब वे एक सरकारी योजना के बारे में जानने के लिए दफ्तर गए थे तो अधिकारी ने उन्हें सिर्फ हिंदी में ही बात करने के लिए कहा था।“यह समझाने के बाद भी कि हम हिंदी नहीं बोल सकते, अधिकारी ने हमें हिंदी सीखने के लिए कहा, कई बार इसका जिक्र किया और इसका मज़ाक उड़ाया।”",
      "पहले, अंग्रेजी में कमजोर छात्रों को दो माध्यमों से मदद दी जाती थी। एक तरीका तो औपचारिक था जिसमे सभी कोर्स आते हैं। ऑफर कियें जाने वाले कोर्स थे ENG112 और COM200। और दूसरा था अनौपचारिक तरीका जिसमे आती थी English Speaking Classes by DoSA, TTC(Technical Terminology Classes) और ECC(English Communication Classes) जो कि Institute Counselling Service(ICS) द्वारा आयोजित किया जाता था।",
      "ENG112 course EDT (English Diagnostic Test) के माध्यम से दिया जाता था जो की orientation के समय होता था। ये एक अधिक कोर्स था जिसे बच्चे तब करते थे जब बाकी बच्चे HSS Level 1 course करते थे लेकिन इसे HSS का नाम नहीं दिया गया था जिसके कारण बच्चों को एक अधिक कोर्स करना पड़ता था। इस वजह से बच्चों के curriculum में भी दिक्कत आती थी जिसके चलते बाद में ENG112 को भी HSS Level 1 Course बना दिया गया था, लेकिन इसके पाठ्यक्रम को फिर भी नहीं बदला गया था। Y21 बैच तक COM200 एक पाठ्यक्रम था जिसे लेना सभी विद्यार्थियों के लिए अनिवार्य था। इसमे भी कुछ खामिया थी जैसे पाठ्यक्रम में अत्याधिक विद्यार्थियों का होना, बच्चों में भाषा की विविधता का होना तथा पाठ्यक्रम में दिए गए समय का अपर्याप्त होना। चूंकि ये कोर्स कोई विशेष विभाग तो लेता नहीं था इसलिए असफल होने वाले विद्यार्थियों को कई मुश्किलों का सामना करना पडता था।",
      "इसकी जगह पर Y22 batch के लिए ELC111(Basic), ELC112(Intermediate) और ELC113(Advanced) course को लाया गया था। अब सभी विद्यार्थियों के लिए प्रथम वर्ष में एक अंग्रेजी का कोर्स लेना अनिवार्य है जिसका फैसला EDT से होगा। कोर्स केवल कुछ हद तक ही बच्चों को मदद कर सकता है। इस खामी को ICS ने पहचाना और TTC aur ECC प्रदान करना शुरू किया था। DoSA ने भी इंग्लिश स्पीकिंग क्लास लेना शुरू किया था। सभी की ये पहल बच्चों के लिए काफ़ी मददगार साबित हुई थी। लेकिन वे इंस्ट्रक्टर जो इंग्लिश स्पीकिंग क्लास लेते थे, उनके कैंपस छोड़ते ही ये क्लास भी बंद हो गई और उधर ICS की क्लासेस में भी विद्यार्थियों की संख्या गिरती चली गई।यहां तक ​​कि जिन प्रोफेसर्स से हमने बात की, उन्होंने भी छात्रों की नई भाषा सीखने की अनिच्छा पर ध्यान दिया।कुछ प्रोफेसरों ने पहले सेमेस्टर की शुरुआत से पहले अंग्रेजी पाठ्यक्रमों की पेशकश करने का सुझाव दिया।  शायद एक विस्तारित ओरिएंटेशन, जिससे छात्र अंग्रेजी में पढ़ाए जाने वाले अन्य पाठ्यक्रमों को संभालने के लिए बेहतर ढंग से सुसज्जित हो सकें।",
      "नये UGARC के आने से पहले सभी विभाग communication पाठ्यक्रम प्रदान करते थे जिसका मुख्य उद्देश्य बच्चों में संचार कौशल विकसित करना होता था। उदाहरणानुसार गणित विभाग के प्रोफेसर छात्रों को प्रूफ़ लिखना सिखाते थे तो वहीं इलेक्ट्रिकल विभाग के प्रोफेसर मुख्य तौर पर Resume लिखना सिखाते थे, जिसको Y22 से रोक दिया गया है। ये department-level communication courses को Y22 बैच के साथ बंद कर दिया गया एवं  ELC को इसका एक बेहतर रिपलेसमेंट के रूप में देखा जाने लगा। किसी भी कोर्स की कमियों को 2-3 बैच की समीक्षा के आधार पर दूर किया जाता है। अभी सिर्फ Y22 की प्रतिक्रिया पर कोर्स में कोई बदलाव नहीं किया जा सकता है।",
      "“हालांकि, यह सच है कि कोई भी प्रणाली किसी भी तरह से परिपूर्ण नहीं है, लेकिन इसकी सारी अक्षमता प्रशासन पर नहीं पड़ती है। किसी भी प्रणाली की प्रभावकारिता अंततः उन लोगों पर निर्भर करती है जिन्हें वह लाभान्वित करती है, और हर प्रकार से ELC केवल तभी वास्तव में अपने उद्देश्य को पूरा कर सकता है यदि जो लोग सच में अपने अंग्रेजी संचार कौशल में सुधार करना चाहते हैं वे वास्तव में भाग लेते हैं और इसका पूरा लाभ उठाते हैं। इसके अलावा, यह उल्लेखनीय है कि एक उच्च-स्तरीय ELC पाठ्यक्रम को हमेशा उन छात्रों द्वारा OE पाठ्यक्रम के रूप में लिया जा सकता है, जिन्होंने पहले निम्न-स्तरीय पाठ्यक्रम किया था और अपने अंग्रेजी संचार कौशल को आगे बढ़ाने में रुचि रखते हैं ”– किंशुक सियोल,Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC) के student nominee.",
      "शिवानी सेंटर, जिसकी स्थापना अगस्त 2021 में हुई थी, एक और माध्यम है जिसकी स्थापना आई आई टी कानपुर में हिंदी और अन्य भारतीय भाषाओं को फिर से शामिल करने के उद्देश्य से हुई थी। शिवानी सेंटर का मुख्य उद्देश्य उन नए छात्रों की मदद करना है, जिन्होंने अपनी स्कूली शिक्षा और जेईई यात्रा हिंदी में पूरी की है और उन्हें पूरी तरह से अंग्रेजी शिक्षा में समायोजित किया जा सके। जिन बच्चों को हिंदी ना आने की वजह से दोस्तों से बात करने में दिक्कत होती है उनके लिए शिवानी सेंटर में हिंदी कक्षाएं भी प्रदान की जाती हैं। हिंदी के अलावा यहां क्षेत्रीय भाषाएँ जैसे तमिल, मलयालम या कन्नड़ भी सिखाई जाती है।",
      "EPP, एक अंग्रेजी दक्षता कार्यक्रम है जिसे उन लोगों के लिए एक पाठ्यक्रम की तरह अयोजित किया जाता था जो अंग्रेजी को सीखना और उसमें सुधार करना चाहते थे लेकिन कोरोना के चलते इसे बंद करना पड़ा था। इसके योजना के पीछे मुख्य रूप से प्रोफेसर भास्कर दासगुप्ता शामिल थे और उनके साथ और भी संकाय सदस्य और छात्र निकाय भी शामिल थे। इस प्रोग्राम ने छात्रों को प्लेसमेंट सीज़न में काफ़ी मदद की थी।प्रोफेसर भास्कर दासगुप्ता के नेतृत्व में एक समूह वर्तमान में कार्यक्रम को पुनर्जीवित करने की दिशा में काम कर रहा है और अंग्रेजी टीम और तकनीकी टीम में शामिल होने के लिए volunteers की तलाश कर रहा है, जिसके संबंध में वह शीघ्र ही studentlist पर लिखेंगे।",
      "संक्षेप में, परिसर में भाषा संबंधी बाधाएँ वास्तविक हैं और छात्रों को शैक्षणिक और सामाजिक रूप से प्रभावित करती हैं। पाठ्यक्रमों और सहायता सेवाओं जैसे निरंतर प्रयासों के बावजूद, बाधा बनी हुई है। इसके लिए प्रयासों में सुधार की आवश्यकता है, न केवल इसे प्रदान करने वालों द्वारा बल्कि उन छात्रों द्वारा भी जिन्हें इनकी आवश्यकता है। जैसा कि हम देखते हैं, यह लेख कैंपस जनता को ऐसे भाषाई मतभेदों के प्रति जागरूक होने और उनसे सहानुभूतिपूर्वक निपटने की आवश्यकता भी बताता है। समझने और अधिक समावेशी होने का प्रयास आवश्यक है। ये सिर्फ संख्याएं नहीं हैं, बल्कि साथी छात्र भी हैं जिन्हें हम अपने आसपास संघर्ष करते हुए देखते हैं। हमें स्थिति की बेहतरी के लिए किए जा सकने वाले छोटे-छोटे प्रयासों के बारे में सोचना चाहिए।",

    "title": "Sexual Harassment – A campus wide survey",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",

      "Amidst the beating hearts, smiling faces, and the chaos that was the Orientation’22, whispers about numerous cases of sexual harassment circled the campus. Incidents ranged from stalking to inappropriate touching, with reports not only from the latest batch but also from students in older batches. Later that year, girls were prohibited from entering hall-13 premises as a perceived measure of safety. This made us reflect critically on the nature, prevalence, and institutional response to such cases on campus.How do people understand sexual harassment? How prevalent is it? What becomes of such cases?These and many other such questions guided the following investigation.",
      "Vox conducted a comprehensive survey on our campus. Our intent is to raise pertinent questions based on the data, initiating conversation on the broader implications.",
      "The survey, done through an anonymous Google form, had three main parts. First, it asked about the respondent’s experiences of sexual harassment on campus, including some questions with multiple correct answers. Second, it looked at institutional bodies and experiences/perceptions surrounding them wanting to understand the role of institutional bodies in these situations. The third part focused on people’s ideas about and around sexual harassment. It ended by asking respondents about their awareness of the issue.",
      "705 individuals contributed to this dataset. Among this group, 414 respondents (comprising 58.7% of the total) identified as male, while 281 individuals (constituting 39.8% of the respondents) identified as female, with one respondents identifying as non-binary. Additionally, the respondents included 565 undergraduate students and 130 postgraduate students (rest did not respond to the question).",
      "In this article, we present the findings of this survey, aiming for an objective portrayal of data. It sheds light on the prevalence, extent, and nature of such incidents, exploring different aspects without immediately going to definitive answers. In subsequent editions, we will try to explore (via investigation) potential answers to these questions for a more comprehensive understanding of the landscape surrounding sexual harassment.",
      "In response to the initial question that asked if the respondent had ever experienced sexual harassment on campus- the survey revealed that almost 25% of those surveyed have encountered some type of sexual harassment (as perthis definition).",
      "This means – nearly every1 in 4people who participated in the survey have experienced harassment in various forms. To gauge the situation better, we also inquired whether the respondents were aware of anyone who had faced sexual harassment.",
      "The results reveal that close to 35% of participants know someone who has had similar experiences.Notably, a significant portion of individuals, even if they personally haven’t experienced harassment, are aware of someone within their circles who has. This, to an extent, indicates that the issue of sexual harassment is not hidden; it exists within people’s awareness and is not invisibilised as much as we would like to believe – both through first-hand experiences or through accounts of similar experiences around them. This suggests a visibility greater than might initially appear.",
      "Next, we attempt to understand in what form sexual harassment is prevalent on campus (the respondent could choose multiple options). We note that almost all forms of sexual harassment are present on campus, ranging from sexually suggestive remarks and sexist jokes to more serious cases of sexual assault.",
      "The following graph is the same statistic with percentages sorted by male and female, UG and PG, combined to give a complete picture.",
      "Having found out that cases of harassment seem numerically significant – we enquire about the identity of the perpetrator. 119 of the 147 (81%) responses mentioned someone known to be the perpetrator. From the responses, the known person could further be divided on the basis of the power dynamics. 73% included romantic partners, friends, wingies or batchmates while 8% mentioned faculty or senior students as the perpetrator. The remaining 28 of the 147 (19%) comprised of the unknown people ranging from office clerk and mess worker to HC staff.",
      "The data suggests then that harassment knows no boundaries and infiltrates all corners of campus life. From friends to faculty, mess workers to office clerks, it seems no nook is untouched by these incidents. Another obvious inference is that the perpetrator in more than half the cases is a friend/intimate partner and in a significant number of cases is at-least an acquaintance, i.e. someone you are familiar with.",
      "We have grown up hearing that reportage of harassment is an acute problem, especially in India where a lot of stigma is attached to such experiences.Does this dynamic reproduce itself within campus?We look at a few statistics around rates of reportage by respondents who faced harassment in some form or the other. Reporting here includes complaints made to either Women cell and ICC on campus or filing an FIR. This data is particularly important – it may help us gauge the barriers to reportage which are both internal (internalised notions about the consequences of reporting) and institutional (confidence in institute bodies).",
      "It turns out that nearly 92% of our respondents who faced sexual harassment did not report the incident further. We specifically follow up this question by asking respondents why they did not report the incident. Out of 162 responses, ~44% felt that the incident was “too trivial to be reported”, 43% did not want to get involved in the resulting “drama”, 30% felt that “the situation would improve if I just ignored it”. The question was a checkbox type where more than one option could be marked.",
      "A related question in the survey asked the respondents “When is the right time to report a case of sexual harassment?”. More than half the respondents thought that an incident should be reported“As soon as one feels uncomfortable”. The next two most popular responses were“If it keeps happening repeatedly”and“Only when it becomes extreme”. This may indicate that people have very varied beliefs on what constitutes harassment, insofar as the episode demands to be reported. We explore this heterogeneity later in the text.",
      "In the next section we look at possible reasons behind the low rates of reportage. We have clubbed similar subjective responses into categories to isolate the problems. We try to raise some relevant questions –",
      "There were a set of responses that asserted their distrust in the bodies on campus.",
      "“I don’t have any trust in WC or ICC.”",
      "One response said“He was faculty, I thought that would become worse for me”.",
      "Other similar responses included",
      "“Got review from my seniors that Women’s cell will not help you much”,",
      "“I don’t have faith in the institutional mechanism to address this. It will be emotionally taxing for me, because the process itself is difficult and I was also concerned about peers judging me for what happened.”",
      "“I have handled such people in past institutes and complaining hasn’t led to any conclusive results. In my experience, perpetrators don’t usually get penalised harshly when there is a reputed autonomous institute at play”",
      "“I do not consider the authorities or CS apt enough to understand and handle the case respectfully”",
      "“Didn’t think it would be taken seriously going by previous records”",
      "The responses reflect a sentiment of perceived mistrust and incompetence within the institutional bodies. These notions are likely rooted in either the first-hand experiences of the respondents or the collective experiences shared within their social circles within (or outside) the campus. In both scenarios, the question arises:what factors have led individuals to have such reservations concerning the institute bodies?An issue that is anyway extremely taboo-ised in the status-quo, needs the redressal bodies to establish a level of trust. Assuming that the responses to our survey are indicative of the larger population’s sentiments, some questions that arise are –Are the institute bodies aware of their perception within the campus community? If yes, have they taken steps to proactively address these concerns? Have they been responsive to the sentiments held by individuals? Have steps been taken to bridge the gap in trust and competence?– These are some questions we wish to delve into in later pieces.",
      "Many respondents expressed that they chose not to report the incident out of fear that it might become public knowledge and negatively impact their image. Some were concerned about being victim-blamed and having their character questioned. Additionally, they were weary about the potential ‘drama’ that might ensue as a result of reporting.",
      "Some such responses read –",
      "“I did not want to get involved in any type of ‘drama’”",
      "“Afraid of what society will think about me”",
      "“Scared of victim blaming and shaming”",
      "“I was just too scared”",
      "Earlier, we presented the respondent’s answer to “Who was the perpetrator?” and saw that while in most cases, the perpetrator is somebody you know well (friend, acquaintance), it may be anyone from a doctor at the Heath Center to a Faculty member.",
      "The implications of this statistic raises some questions –Does the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator influence the victim’s response to the transgression? Does the close connection deter reporting, as victims may be reluctant to subject their friends to consequences?Some responses to “Why did you not report the incident?” read-",
      "“He is my friend”",
      "“The perpetrator in my case were my close friends – so I was also empathetic towards it”",
      "In cases where the perpetrator is somebody in a position of authority ( such as faculty, PhD mentor etc) how does the victim address the issue despite the power dynamic? Some responses said –",
      "“He was faculty, I thought that will become worse for me”",
      "“I was in doubt whether the touch was intentional considering the old age of my supervisor”",
      "These questions open a window into the complex interplay between personal relationships and the reporting of harassment incidents.Do redressal bodies on campus recognize the implications of these dynamics?Some responses said –",
      "“No instant action taken by either Women Cell or ICC neither by my supervisor to make me feel safe in the lab. When I reported the incident to my supervisor, his behaviour was very insensitive…. I met Women Cell *redacted* her gesture of talking was also not very appropriate. Her questions and some comments were offending to me.”",
      "Following this, we received feedback mentioning the normalisation of particular types of sexual harassment. Normalisation here means that harassment is such a frequent phenomenon, that people tend to accept it as part of daily life- and hence have rationale to not do anything about it proactively.",
      "“I felt it was too trivial to be reported”was the highest response",
      "Multiple replies mentioned“Things like this happen all the time”as the reason for not reporting the case.",
      "“The usage of sexually suggestive cuss words, and invasion of one’s privacy, seems rampant in IIT Kanpur. I did not want to be the odd one out – for one person alone cannot change the society. I can work on myself, and that’s all I can do. Perhaps IITK would be a better place if the students were more educated about socially appropriate speech and expression.”",
      "This raises an essential question for consideration –What process leads to the normalisation of certain acts? How can we address things that are seen as normal for most, even if it causes discomfort to someone?Furthermore, it prompts an inquiry into the effectiveness of the sensitisation organised by the responsible campus authorities.",
      "Another set of responses come from (presumably) men who did not go ahead with reporting the incident because –“I think no one will listen to men”“I thought there is no cell for men that’s why”“Ladkon ki sunta kon hai”",
      "Another statistic that adds some context to the one above is what people do and do not consider sexual harassment.",
      "Students come from diverse backgrounds – from different cultures and different places. This means that for each one, internalised notions about gender, violence and (specifically) harassment differ considerably. This is exactly what the responses seem to show. We can conclude from the above data, at least, that the question of what constitutes sexual harassment has different answers for different people. What may be considered harassment to one person might be shrugged off as insignificant by another.",
      "For instance, on the one hand, 63 respondents claim to be victims of invasion of private space (getting too close for no reason, brushing against or cornering someone) while at the same time 69 respondents do not consider invasion of private space (getting too close for no reason, brushing against or cornering someone) as a form of harassment. We see this trend across the different types of sexual harassment – where many people claim to have been victims of a particular kind of harassment, many others do not recognize that category as harassment at all.",
      "In any case, this discrepancy in understanding may have strong implications. When individuals observe their peers failing to acknowledge certain experiences as instances of sexual harassment, it may contribute to a heightened sense of alienation and trauma for victims. Such circumstances could then diminish the likelihood of victims reporting the incidents further. This statistic underscores the importance of a collective understanding and awareness surrounding the nuances of sexual harassment and how it is experienced.",
      "Sessions by the Women’s cell conducted during the orientation week in part aim to bridge this discrepancy in awareness. Having said that –do we need more elaborate ways of addressing the awareness problem – ways that involve deeper and continuous (longer) engagement with the topic? What might these ways look like?",
      "Higher education in India has gone through what has been called a quiet revolution. Within Higher education institutions (HEIs), gender parity has almost become a reality with women constituting 42% of the student body (at the time of this survey) from 10% at independence. However, this surge means individuals coming from diverse socio-economic backgrounds converge in institutions like ours, each having their own internalised ideas about and around gender. Each of us brings our own set of beliefs and stereotypes, shaping our definitions of what’s appropriate. As families invest in the education of their daughters and sons, fostering aspirations for change, the need for ensuring gender safety becomes that much more important.",
      "Our institute is a mosaic of culture, ideas and beliefs. Inside these walls is a microcosm of the broader society outside, and as such, it is essential that we address certain issues to shape a better society for tomorrow. In this series of articles, we will attempt to bring to attention aspects that deserve discussion.

      "Introduction",
      "Overcrowded lecture halls, overutilised equipment, getting rejected for multipleopen electives, piled up bags, hunting for the perfect study space and an ideal chair make us wonder if our academic landscape is immune to the changing strength of students. As the end semester examinations have concluded, one might have been troubled with finding a peaceful place to study given the crunched academic andresidential infrastructure. To answer these questions, our team at Vox went on an investigative journey to uncover the answers, seeking insights from professors, study space staff, and the Dean of Academic Affairs. Join us as we navigate the intricacies of the academic crunch at IITK to future plans and solutions awaiting us.",
      "",
      "Current Situation",
      "As our campus welcomed an influx of approximately 8500 students in the post-COVID era, the existing infrastructure found itself under pressure. The surge in student numbers made crowded lecture halls, constrained open electives and burdened labs commonplace. The effects of this increment have rippled into the academic experience of both students and faculties.",
      "A dedicated team of around 540 faculty members instructs these students in the classrooms. However, the current student-to-faculty ratio is 18:1, slightly off the ideal 10:1 ratio. While recruitment efforts are underway, it’s a time-consuming process. Furthermore, the available lecture halls and labs on campus have struggled to accommodate the increasing student population.",
      "Regarding overburdened labs, Prof. K.S. Venkatesh said, “In a course like ESC201, our resource constraints us to limit the number of students in a lab at 120 per day for five days a week, but due to unavailability of students and schedule clashes, we need to push in ~145 students on some days and ~90 on other days, which puts a burden on the labs.”",
      "“We have no room to reschedule the labs. Every resource is fully consumed, whether the number of tables in the labs, the number of days, or the number of tutors. Even if we have more tutors and tables in the lab, the students can’t come and attend two labs at the same time due to rescheduling of labs due to public holidays”",
      "Prof. K.S. Venkateshadded",
      "Prof. Yatindra Nath Singh also resonated with this by saying,“Meticulous scheduling and resource distribution are needed to use our facilities efficiently.”",
      "",
      "The study spaces on our campus (like the Student Lounge (SL), P.K. Kelkar Library, the Non Core Labs (NCL), the Computer Centre (CC), the Rajeev Motwani (RM) Building, the H R Kadim Diwan (KD) Building and Hall reading rooms) can accommodate approximately 1,500 students against a strength of 8500 students on the campus. Given the crunched residential facility, many hostel rooms are already overcrowded, so the study spaces are in high demand during exam periods. But they operate at full capacity, leaving students searching for a quiet place to study when they need them the most. The problem gets amplified when there are no department buildings for some departments, and other facilities are restricted in terms of timing, like the Student Lounge (SL) and entry to other departments during the night, like the Rajeev Motwani (RM) Building and the H R Kadim Diwan (KD) Building.",
      "",
      "Impact on students",
      "In November ’22, the lab examination of the ESC201 course was foregone, citing insufficient lab capacity. The routine labs were carried out with three people on one equipment. The condition has improved since then, with the Y22 batch having lab sessions with two people on one equipment and a lab examination of 1.5-hour duration to compensate for limited capacity.",
      "Crunched study spaces, high student-faculty ratio and inadequate lab resources profoundly affect students’ academic experience. The interaction between faculty and students has been limited to content delivery during the lecture hours.",
      "",
      "We questioned professors about the success of the Student Reaction Survey (SRS) in improving students’ learning experience. Some professors pointed out that the survey has benefited them, but others pointed out that the course is over when they get the feedback. The benefits of the feedback could only be passed on to future batches, thereby suggesting conducting SRS in real time. Prof. K.S. Venkatesh also pointed out that there needed to be incentives or recognition for faculties to work on their teaching methodology, without which the intended benefits of the survey may not be realized. The Dean of Academic Affairs, Prof. Shalabh, urged the students to actively participate in the Student Reaction Survey (SRS) so that faculties can incorporate constructive feedback to improve upon their courses. He assured all the students that the reaction survey is entirely anonymous, including the comments, and it is impossible to determine the respondents’ identities (students).",
      "",
      "Prof. Ishan Sharma, an IITK alumnus and Department of Mechanical Engineering Professor, mentions how UGARC has reduced contact hours of courses of the student’s major department. The tutorial hours are the first to be removed to compensate for the lost contact hours. The student-faculty ratio might be 18:1, but it touches 200:1 in some second and third-year mechanical engineering courses, for example, Dynamics (ME209), which now has no tutorials.",
      "",
      "Regarding the strength of tutorial classes, Prof. Shalabh said that currently, the tutorial classes have an approximate student-faculty ratio of 40:1. The institute is trying to bring that number to 30:1 by recruiting more faculties.",
      "",
      "Prof. K.S. Venkatesh, an alumnus of IIT Kanpur, reckons how he knew every student in his tutorial during his time as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a course. He also emphasised a need for tutorials with reduced strength for better one-to-one interaction.",
      "Solutions & Future Plans",
      "After exploring the reasons for the academic crunch and its impacts, let’s delve into the solutions and upcoming plans being taken by IITK to solve the issue. In a similar context, the Dean of Academic Affairs, Prof. Shalabh, replied, “We have constantly seen a surge in the intake of students, and the facilities take some time to get in place. The administration is always ready to share the responsibility of providing the students with a smooth academic experience even in the constraints.”",
      "“Given a choice, I may compromise on residential halls but won’t want to crunch academic facilities, which has a lifelong effect on a student’s career.”-Prof. Shalabh",
      "Dhwanit Balwani, the current President of Student Gymkhana, added that IITK is planning to build a Library extension and a new faculty building.",
      "",
      "Prof. Shalabh clarified that the administration will not compromise students’ academic experience at IITK. Hence, they’re constantly looking to efficiently organize educational spaces, like renovating the library and converting some rooms in the Diamond Jubilee Academic Complex (DJAC) into lecture halls. The institute has also established more extensive labs in DJAC and procured new equipment. Alongside, new academic buildings are being built with a vertical extension to use the limited space available on the campus efficiently. A computer lab with 196 computers has been developed, and more developments are in progress.",
      "",
      "Vox was informed about initiatives to reduce overcrowding at the library. Efforts are underway to lower the number of shelves and relocate more books to the basement, freeing up additional study space. Further, plans are being examined to convert the staff area into a study space. A proposal to expand the library to the parking area without tampering with the existing infrastructure is also being considered.",
      "",
      "In conclusion, the academic crunch at IITK poses multiple challenges stemming from an increase in the number of students and limited space. The academic and residential crunch together aggravates the situation of students at IITK. The compromised student-faculty ratio and lab capacity have led to concerns about the quality of interaction between faculty and students and the students’ learning experience. The faculty and administration have shown cooperation and efforts to provide the best experience to students and optimize the existing spaces. Still, as the institution evolves to meet the demands of its growing student body, a more comprehensive and long-term approach is required to maintain the academic excellence of IITK.",

      "Attendance has long been a moot point of discussion amongst both Professors and Students. As the semester begins, a few FCHs manage to send shivers down one’s spine with their attendance policies. In an attempt to understand the views of Campus Junta, we at Vox Populi conducted a survey on the “Effect of Attending Classes and Attendance Policies” and simultaneously met a few professors to gather their opinions on this topic.",
      "What follows is a list of questions we compiled on the effect of Attendance policies, answered by various professors, along with the data we collected from our survey.",
      "From our survey of 457 respondents, 260 people claimed that they attend all or most of their classes; 108 people opined that they attend classes around quizzes and important topics; and 85 people said that they rarely attend classes.",
      "When we asked the professors about the attendance they usually see in class and whether it bothers them, Prof. P.S. Ghoshdastidar stated that he usually sees low attendance after mid-semester exams since “students become very complacent because they are assured of a decent grade after looking at their mid-semester performance.”",
      "Prof. Manindra says that attendance does bother him. He recalled teaching a class of 350 students in the previous semester and noted that he never saw more than 100 students attend the class. He attributes the fall in attendance to the post-pandemic scenario, where students have more access to online resources, which might have affected their motivation to attend physical classes.",
      "This sentiment is echoed in our survey as well, where 76 percent of respondents said they wouldn’t attend the class offline if the same lecture were available online.",
      "Among other factors deterring students from attending classes, early morning classes (opted by 314/421 people), very few classes or long intervals between classes on the same day (opted by 165 respondents) seemed to be the prominent factors.",
      "When we asked students to rate the importance of attendance on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all important and 5 being most important, out of 457 respondents, the majority gave it a rating of 3 (110 people) or 1 (111 people). Only 35% of respondents gave a score of 4 or above.",
      "On the other hand, all professors agree with the strong correlation between attending classes and students’ performance in courses. Prof. Ghoshdastidar states “The courses at IITK are uniquely structured, and the way content is presented is very different from any other platform. Therefore, even if a student misses a single class, they are definitely going to face some difficulty understanding the course, which is bound to affect their performance.” He also presents a correlation he could gather from his courses:“Most students who don’t attend classes regularly don’t even score enough to get a C; they mostly land with a D or an F.”",
      "Prof. Harbola further adds, “In my courses, at least, I make sure that it is essential for students to attend classes to perform well, and I structure them very differently from any other course available online. My motivation as a teacher is to ensure that tomorrow when a student meets a person from MIT, they look them in the eye and say, I learned better than you did.” He further elaborates on the importance of attendance and teacher-student interaction and makes it clear that attendance is bound to impact performance.",
      "When we questioned students on the correlation between attendance and performance, out of 447 respondents, 42% believed that attending lectures and tutorials helped them understand easily and kept them in sync with the professor. In contrast, 28% felt their performance was independent of attending lectures and tutorials.",
      "Upon closer examination, our survey pointed out that another major factor that decides whether or not one attends their classes largely depends on the attendance policy of that course, as 56% of students said that they go to classes only as per the attendance percentage required based on the grading policy.",
      "Professors hold great power in deciding what this policy would be, as unlike most colleges, there is no institute-wide attendance policy, and professors are free to determine how to incorporate attendance into their courses if they choose to implement it at all.",
      "Professor Arijit Kundu, who mandates 90% attendance in his course, says,“The Motto behind 90% attendance is just to push the students to wake up and come to class,”implying that the main reason behind enforcing a set percentage of attendance is to ensure consistency, especially considering the ample extracurricular activities here on campus.In the same context, in one of our previousarticles, Prof. Neeraj Misra states that“Some students may be capable of achieving good grades without regular attendance, but IITK is not a factory to provide grades. Here we inculcate an academic environment, and every student has certain responsibilities.” He further elaborates that attending classes is the fundamental academic responsibility of a student and is bound to impact their learning.",
      "Moreover, in certain courses, instructors assign a portion of the grades to attendance, leading to the question of how significant this practice is in influencing a student’s learning and overall academic performance. Professor Tapobrata Sarkar believes that “enforcing” attendance might not necessarily have a significant impact on a student’s learning or overall grades. Instead, he focuses on creating an enjoyable and engaging learning experience. He aims to impart knowledge that students can apply in their later lives. Similarly, Prof. Harbola shares the same view as Prof. Tapobatra .However, he conducts surprise quizzes in the tutorials.“We say continuous evaluation. I’ve changed it to continuous study. What is wrong with that?” ~Professor Harbola",
      "Nonetheless, professors have time and again tested and experimented with attendance policies. While some have stuck to the same policy from the very beginning of their careers, others have changed with the tide.",
      "Professor P.S. Ghoshdastidar mentions how, in the beginning, he didn’t enforce any attendance policy in his classes; however, now he has a certain weighting of attendance in the grading. He remarks, “I joined in July 1984, and until 2000, there were no complaints from any faculty member regarding students not attending classes. The attendance began to fall in the Y2K batches. I think this is due to easy access to the internet, and the students get the material online and don’t attend classes.”",
      "Prof. MK Harbola says he used to have an attendance policy for smaller classes but not for larger classes; however, later, he realized that his role was to teach and not enforce attendance on students. ”People are here to study; they don’t want to study. Why should I force them? That’s their problem. They are wasting their parent’s money.”",
      "Despite graded attendance and changes in the instructor’s policy, we see that there are some pertinent issues due to which students do not attend classes. According to our survey, the three leading causes are uninteresting teaching methods (275 respondents chose this ), difficulty in understanding the professor (222 respondents), and lack of interest in the course’s subject (142 respondents).",
      "As the final question in our questionnaire, we asked both the professors and students what their ideal attendance policy would be: Two main approaches were highlighted.1.Students are functional adults; it is their choice whether to come to class or not at the end of the day, and professors would rather not spend resources policing them. They also believe that forcing attendance does not change the student’s intent to learn, which is the real problem.At the same time, both students and professors recognize that, in many cases, the lectures do not seem engaging enough to the student. Motivation drops, and attendance follows. Prof. Tapobrata Sarkar mentions that he overcame the issue of engagement in class by having an open discussion with his students about their teaching needs. He does not follow a compulsory attendance policy.2. Incentive:Many professors set an attendance requirement to urge students to make the extra effort to remain in touch with the course. For example, Prof. Arijit Kundu acknowledges the variety of activities on campus. This is why he says he sets attendance criteria for UGs (“especially first-years”) so that they have an incentive to learn throughout the semester as opposed to cramming before exams.",
      "Where,",
      "Attendance as a binary rule for passing the class: You must attend a set percentage of classes to be eligible for giving major exams and passing the course",
      "Attendance as a graded entity: Attending each class gives you a certain percentage of marks",
      "Attendance as a binary graded entity: Attending a minimum number of classes would make you eligible for extra marks",
      "The scaling of grades according to attendance: Attendance serves as multiplying factor to your course total",
      "Among students, we also see a divided opinion. While 49.7% of the students do not want any attendance policy, 43% of the students do want attendance to hold weightage",
      "To conclude, IITK’s unique position in providing freedom to professors to set their attendance policies has thrown up some interesting policies.Education has long been an evolving landscape, and this continued evolution necessitates thoroughly examining these policies, largely driven by the insights derived from the professors’ perspectives. To quote Professor Manindra Agarwal, “It is clear that we will have to experiment with different methods of teaching as the traditional methods of teaching don’t seem to work anymore. We’ll have to try and find out what is working right.”",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the writers and theirs alone.",
      "",
      "Does joining a top 5 IIT make someone more likely to go for research? Or does someone’s interest in research make them more likely to join a top-5 IIT? Prithwiraj Choudhury, Ina Ganguli and Patrick Gaule from the NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) in the US have recently published aworking paperanalysing the effect of studying in one of the Top 5 IITs on migration for graduate studies. As students of one of the top 5 IITs, we were curious as to what the researchers conclude about us.",
      "The authors acknowledge the contribution of highly skilled immigrants to US technological innovation, and observe that “they study in elite universities in their home countries before getting advanced degrees abroad. For example, many successful Indian immigrants in the technology industry—including Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc./Google, and Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM—are undergraduate alumni of the selective Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).” Therefore, they study the extent to which the elite-institutions of India facilitate migration, focusing on the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), mainly the top 5 ones(including IIT Madras, IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur and IIT Kharagpur), which are prestigious highly-selective universities, with an acceptance rate that is lower than the Ivy league colleges.  They conclude that while students from one of the top 5 IITs are morelikely to migrate for graduate studies, no significant difference is observed in migration for work.",
      "The paper focuses on the top scorers in the JEE 2010 examination, who could have gotten admission in one of the top 5 IITs. While 9 out of the top 10 scorers have migrated, the percentage decreases with lower JEE scores with 62 among the top 100 and 360 among the top 1000 choosing to migrate. The percentage of migration is sizable throughout the sample. Most of the students migrate for graduate school – 83% of the individuals migrated to pursue a Masters or Ph.D, while only 17% migrated for work.",
      "Research methodology",
      "The authors found it difficult to get data on high performing students in public domain. Since few past surveys have been conducted with similar focus, the lack of relevant data makes it challenging to study migration patterns, since it requires information both about the migrants as well as the stayers. To overcome this, the authors with the help of a dedicated team used the data of JEE 2010 that was leaked publicly, which included the full names and JEE scores of the students along with their final allotment (chosen IIT and branch). They used various platforms including LinkedIn, Github, ResearchGate, AngelList and alumni yearbooks to locate the migration outcomefor roughly the top 2,500 scorers in the general category. They also compared migration outcomes of individuals with the same JEE scores, and hence the same available choices. Finally, the researchers ran a regression to analyse the effect of the score, whether they attended one of the top 5 IITs or not, the gender and the major of students, on their migration status.",
      "",
      "Discussion on migration mechanisms",
      "The relationship between attending a top 5 IIT and subsequent migration is observed from the regression results on the main sample of 2,470 top scorers.It is seen that someone is 4.9% more likely to migrate for graduate school given that they attended a top 5 IIT, and in particular a 5.4% increased likelihood of migrating for Ph.D. One possible reason for the effect of attending a top 5 IIT on migration is the difference inhuman capital, since students with similar ranks might opt for different majors in the top-5 IITs as opposed to other IITs and engineering institutions. The course selectivity or major doesn’t appear to be correlated with migration, suggesting that human capital differences in terms of the major areas of study doesn’t significantly impact migration probabilities.",
      "",
      "Another possible reason could be the signalling value of theIIT brand name.To understand the effect of this, they did a case study on the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), which was converted into an IIT in 2012. While this change was brought about, there was no change in its staff, curriculum, or admission system, allowing the study of the impact of the IIT brand name alone. Comparing BHU students graduating before and after it received the IIT designation, a clear increase of 5.4% is seen in the share of students migrating for graduating school after it became an IIT (2014 and 2015). Hence, the IIT brand name itself appears to promote migration. While the increase is sizable, the migration percentages are still smaller in comparison to the top 5 IITs which perhaps provide a stronger signal.",
      "Lastly, the effect ofalumni networkon migration was analysed. We would guess that alumni networks would play an important role in migration as it can lower the costs for migration by providing students information about opportunities, and can also facilitate access to particular programs where they might have influence over the admission decisions. The results show that the presence of an alumnus from one’s own IIT in a particular destination increases the probability of enrollment there by 30%, while the number of IIT alumni from other IITs doesn’t seem to impact the decision.",
      "In conclusion, we note that the authors broadly conclude the positive impact of alumni network, IIT brand signalling, and studying from top 5 IITs on migration for graduate studies (and especially Ph.D. programmes) while no significant difference is observed for migration driven by work. We can point out attwopossible shortcomings of this research –firstly,the authors are not clear on how they separate enrollment in graduate programmes from the eventual transition of graduates to the industry, andsecondly, the authors have not considered the impact of other social factors such as caste and class on the migration patterns. Overall, this is an interesting study with insights that can potentially influence US immigration policy. We hope you enjoyed this review as much as we did!",

      "In November last year, many wondered, paddling down at the sight of chopped trees along the roadside, speculating what was coming up. However, it wasn’t long before everyone could trace that the campus was getting a cycle track, a separate lane for the bicyclists to paddle on.",
      "The track soon found its way into discussions at student gatherings, with various questions loitering the atmosphere. So we at Vox decided to investigate and answer the campus community’s intriguing questions on the cycle track’s construction.",
      "",
      "",
      "Why was it constructed?",
      "The project was undertaken to ensure the safety of users as per the latest policy and norms set by the Board of Governors of IITK1. The official motive behind the construction of cycle tracks was to safeguard minor children (comprising majorly of school students)from getting involved in an accident due to merging and diverging activities by cyclists and to ensure cycle users’ safety and ease.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The Cost Incurred?",
      "Contrary to the rumoured notion of being alum funded, the track was constructed using a dedicated budget sanctioned by the institute. The institute spentone crore forty-six lakh rupees2on the cycle track, which was constructed in four major sections.",
      "",
      "The contractor is liable for the construction maintenance for one year, after which the zonal in charge of respective zones will maintain the cycle tracks.",
      "(IIT Kanpur’s area is divided into multiple zones for effective management)",
      "",
      "We also tried to get the administration’s view regarding the construction of the cycle track. However, we are still waiting to receive a response to our emails from the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DoIP).",
      "",
      "",
      "Post Construction",
      "While the newly constructed cycle track benefits the student community by providing alternate paths, shortcuts, and ambient experience, as well as a saviour from the scorching sun’s heat, it also apparently helps reduce the number of accidents.",
      "",
      "However, the bright blue colour of the cycle track, though drawing attention, is in stark contrast with the ambience of the campus. Additionally, the requirement of cutting trees for construction have raised environmental concerns.",
      "",
      "Several hindrances on the path, including the natural growth over the track, pose a safety risk for cyclists, especially at night.",
      "",
      "",
      "The unanswered Questions",
      "Despite the administration’s arguments, many questions still need to be answered. In an institute where bicycles are the primary mode of commute, providing a separate track for the same is still an alien concept for the students to digest. The effectiveness of the track can easily be judged by the number of its users and manner of use. With the hanging twigs and branches over the way, insufficient openings to the main road, lack of proper lighting and dissection at places discourages cyclists and has become an attractive choice for pedestrians.",
      "",
      "",
      "There is even more concern about the institute’s priority in fund allocation. While the maintenance of halls, critical for students’ security, keeps delaying owing to a lack of funds, a large sum of money is spent on the cycle track. The seriousness of the amount spent here can be gauged by the fact that Halls at IITK, on average, receive a fund of aroundthree lakhs*for maintenance, which, too, has reduced significantly over the past few years.",
      "We should also recognize that only a handful of people on the campus knew of the cycle track’s construction, depicting limited inclusion of the campus community in the decision-making. Nonetheless, since the cycle track now adds to one of the campus community’s key facilities, we can hope for a more efficient commute and fewer accidents.",

      "Following a major incident in Hall 13, where students were found intoxicated, the Warden-in-Charge enacted a ban on the entry of female students into the premises of Hall 13. In the subsequent days, when female campus residents tried to enter hall 13, to their surprise, entry was denied to them, and the only reason given by the SIS guards was that they had been told to do so. Due to the rumors, confusion, and contentions surrounding this incident, our team investigated the issue. Continue reading to know what happened.",
      "On April 30, following an incident where some residents of H13 along with their female acquaintances were found intoxicated, a ban was imposed on the entry of female students into the Hall 13 premises.",
      "The hall office conveyed that a few incidents in the recent past, as well as the incident involving the intoxication of students, impelled them to impose the ban. Any officials involved in the imposition of this ban, however, did not formally communicate the ban. The closest relevant notice was an email notifying the expulsion of the resident(s) involved in the incident. When probed further, it was found that none of the student representatives, the President, Students’ Gymkhana, or the CoSHA Convener (who acts as the representative of Hall 13 due to the lack of HEC in the hall) were consulted or informed about the ban. The only official who was informed about the ban prior to the imposition was the Dean of Students’ Affairs.  According to a notice sent by the hall warden to the hall office, the ban is to stay in place until “further notice”.",
      "In conversation with the hall office, the main reasoning provided to support the ban was to deter students from bringing and consuming intoxicating substances inside the hall premises.  Additionally, they said that a large number of first-year UG girls were entering Hall 13 by writing “canteen” on the entrance gate register but were actually going to the hall residents’ rooms. According to the hall office, the warden received multiple emails from hall residents and their parents complaining about several objectionable activities that had created an unsuitable environment for students. Therefore, to stop such rule violations, the warden decided to restrict the entry of girls in hall 13.",
      "When asked why the residents were not informed about the ban, the hall office stated that emailing the residents didn’t appear to be necessary in this case, since no restrictions had been imposed on the residents of H13. Adding further, the hall office manager said that the hall warden made this decision taking into consideration the approaching midsems of Y22. He was of the opinion that the freshers were in need of extra guidance and that the ban was necessary to bring discipline back to the hall. In light of the numerous incidents that have occurred in H13 over the past few months, the hall administration has taken steps to reassure the community that there are consequences for violating hall rules.",
      "Considering the pivotal role that the warden played in this situation, we emailed Prof. P. M. Mohite, warden-in-charge of Hall 13, requesting an interview. However, our request was denied by stating that“These are Hall 13 affairs. We do not want to interact with any third party about it. Thank you for your concern.”",
      "According to the President Students’ Gymkhana, as communicated to him by the warden, the ban would be imposed for the entire duration of the stay of Y22 in Hall 13. While the CoSHA representative, Dhruv, and the President both agreed that the move was harsh, the President further opined that the ban should not have been imposed. He added that he had confronted the warden several times for the removal of the ban, to no avail.",
      "This situation raises several questions, starting with how does the consumption of intoxicants relate to the restriction of entry of female students? Was this measure extreme? Or was it necessary and in the best interest of students? Does a blanket restriction on inter-gender hostel movement provide a definitive solution to tackle the central issue of intoxication on campus? Hall residents can consume substances irrespective of the presence of girls and can even partake in other unwarranted activities outside the hall. Instead, can we look for more impactful solutions such as sensitization sessions, individual counseling, or any other measures having a more lasting impact?",
      "It also sheds light on how in general, the right for genders to interact with each other in public spaces like classrooms, cafes, etc., is considered a fundamental privilege that cannot be revoked. On the contrary, this same sense of absoluteness doesn’t seem to extend to private spaces such as rooms in halls. Free inter-hall movement is seen as a “privilege” rather than a basic right that cannot be taken away from the students.",
      "The situation also leads us to more critical questions involving the power dynamics at hand. The warden’s power in matters involving Hall 13 seems absolute, especially in this situation. Imposing a ban without informing any residents or the student representatives, parties most affected by this decision, raises concerns about the feedback system and the value the administration gives to student representation. In this case, there is no body that mediates between these two entities nor a platform where a student can register complaints regarding hall administration. This seemingly absolute power that an appointed faculty possesses in students’ residential spaces raises essential questions about student representation in Hall administration. Is it time that Hall 13 forms an HEC? If not, then what measures can we take to make sure that such incidents do not take place again?",
      "This event also highlights the importance of responsibly exercising the rights given to students and student bodies. It emphasizes the fact that responsibility and freedom go hand in hand. All things considered, it is clear that no situation is black or white, ergo no decision is clearly right or wrong, and as is the case, there are two sides to every story. However, there needs to be accountability and representation at every step in decision making, lest we lose the ‘student’ part of student decision-making.",

      "Ashutosh Muduly, an ex-Quiz Club Coordinator and an active Media and Cultural(MnC) Council member, had applied for the post ofInstitute Secretary for Non-Performing Arts in the MnC Council. After the interviews and voting by the outgoing core committee, it was announced thatAshutosh won the verdict, 11 votes to 6. Around two days later, Kaustubh Agarwal, the General Secretary of the Media and Cultural Council, used his Veto power to dismiss the result. Owing to the rumours, confusion and contentions surrounding this incident, our team investigated the issue and talked to various stakeholders. Continue reading to know what happened.",
      "The Student Gymkhana of our institute is a vast body with everything from a full-fledged Senate to different councils and cells coming under its umbrella. An essential part of the Gymkhana are the Councils, and each council is led by a General Secretary (GenSec), a position democratically elected by the campus – but the GenSec themselves can’t do everything alone, and that necessitated a need for the creation of the erstwhile “Associate Head” position which was recently renamed as the “Institute Secretary”.",
      "What exactly is the role of this post?The Gymkhana Review Committee[1],[2]of the tenure 2019-20 defined the responsibility of the Associate Head (or Institute Secretary) as assisting the General Secretary in performing their duties. The committee defined the appointment procedure of Associate Head (Institute Secretary) voting by the outgoing council core committee (consisting of outgoing General Secretary, previous Institute Secretaries, and all the outgoing coordinators/leaders of various clubs and societies in the council), to include the say of all sections of the council.",
      "A major concern of the Gymkhana Review Committee was the friction these position holders might have with the General Secretary. The Review Committee addressed this discord as a difference of vision. Later in 2020, a document[3]passed in the Senate, created by some outgoing and incoming general secretaries mentioned- “the students selected for this post should be compatible to some extent-” as an essential fact and introduced the concept of Veto. According to it,in appointing the Institute Secretaries, the Incoming General Secretary holds the right to ‘Veto’ a candidate.  It means that the GenSec holds the right to overturn the decision made by the outgoing committee if he/she feels“incompatible”with the elected candidate.",
      "After the verdict was announced, Ashutosh was naturally appalled by this decision. His primary point was the fact that compatibility should not overshadow credibility. He asserted that this sets a bad precedent for the future as any person willing to become the Institute Secretary would believe that being on good terms with the incoming General Secretary is more effective than working hard in the council.",
      "He also questioned the delay in the veto from the General Secretary. He pointed out that it isn’t fair for the General Secretary to announce the Veto after the results for the nominations were out. Ashutosh says that if the General Secretary found him incompatible, he should’ve vetoed the nomination instead of the result. He said he was surprised that veto was utilized, given Kaustubh had clearly told the candidates before the interviews that he had no plan to do so and would respect their decision.",
      "During our interview, Kaustubh admitted that the timing of usage of veto was inappropriate. In hindsight, he realized that he should have promptly shared his opinion with Ashutosh after receiving the nomination. Kaustubh further explained that after the nomination outcome, he had to reconsider his position on employing the veto power for the council’s benefit. While he recognized that the procedure outlining veto is inadequate and ideally should be more comprehensive, he felt compelled to implement the decision in order to prioritize the council’s best interests.",
      "When we asked him why he gives more value to compatibility than credibility, he clarified thatcompatibility and credibility should have to go together to make sure that the council doesn’t run into any issues, and Veto is a right given to the General Secretary to ensure this. The outgoing General Secretary also defended the concept of veto when he was questioned by the outgoing core committee. He said that compatibility and credibility are independent of each other. The former is determined by the incoming GenSec and the latter is determined by the outgoing core committee. Even if one of them gives a negative decision, the candidate cannot be appointed and neither of the two entities can have a say in each other’s decisions.",
      "On questioning Kaustubh about compatibility with Ashutosh, he answered that when they worked together, he felt the work could have been better if he was by himself or with someone other than Ashutosh.",
      "When questioned on how his decision to veto could damage the perception of the committee for upcoming core teams, Kaustubh claimed that if Ashutosh were in the council, it would cause many hindrances in the functioning. He believed that as a team, they would not be able to achieve targets and solve problems in their tenure, leading to further, more significant issues. Since Kaustubh was elected to improve the council, he saw this tradeoff as necessary, despite acknowledging Ashutosh’s dedicated work as a coordinator.",
      "After Kaustubh used his Veto power to dismiss the result, the matter was taken to the Student’s Senate where Ashutosh brought various claims against the veto decision ranging from the unfairness to remove him after winning the election to the lack of proper reasoning behind the move.[4]",
      "In the first special meeting of the Senate[5], Prashant (Chairperson, Students’ Senate) affirmed that all rules had been followed and the veto decision remained valid. According to the rule of veto, as of now, Kaustubh is not obligated to provide an explanation for his decision.",
      "When we asked him about the reason behind the rule’s existence, Prashant suggested that it might have been born out of the belief that it would be unfair to elect someone without consulting the General Secretary. The General Secretary is entrusted with the responsibility of working in collaboration with the elected Institute Secretaries throughout their tenure. Thus, the Senate of 2019-20, in establishing the rule, likely considered the veto as a necessary power to ensure the fruitful collaboration of the General Secretary and Institute Secretaries in their efforts to enhance the council.",
      "When we asked about his response to Ashutosh’s concerns, Prashant acknowledged that the current rule regarding veto might have loopholes and the potential for future failures. As a solution, he proposed that the Rules and Procedure Committee (RPC) should review and examine the rule and its procedures, a suggestion that was agreed upon by the Senate.",
      "The Rules and Procedure Committee (RPC) is responsible for overseeing the rules and procedures of the entire Gymkhana. Presently, the committee consists only of the Chairperson and Parliamentarian. As of now,  the RPC meeting has not taken place.",
      "The current problems with veto are not just limited to its conception but also thelack of clarity regarding its process. Kaustubh personally sought guidance from various past and present Gymkhana members to comprehend the intricacies of the veto procedure. As highlighted by Abhiraj, the Parliamentarian of the Students’ Senate, the veto rule lacks thorough scrutiny to ensure the indispensability of every word and sentence, as well as comprehensive coverage of all possible scenarios and edge cases. Furthermore, since the rule has not been incorporated into the constitution, it does not provide exhaustive guidelines.",
      "When our team asked why such a huge power was not given a proper framework at the least, with there being no mention of any procedure regarding the use of veto, renominations, and the boundaries of using veto, The Parliamentarian responded that “it was up to the former parliamentarians to answer that”.",
      "This lack of framework leads to a large amount of subjectivity in implementing the rule. It still not clear whether Ashutosh is eligible for any other position within the council core committee. It’s also still not clear whether there is a limit on the number of times the veto power can be utilized.",
      "And to top it all, the major issue is that the General Secretary can veto an elected person without being accountable for the reasoning. This deviates from the practice observed in the real world- the person exercising veto is accountable for their decision with reasoning. For example, in the US Senate, “A veto occurs when the President returns the legislation to the House in which it originated, usually with a message explaining the rationale for the Veto. This Veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House.”",
      "Renominations were held for both Performing and Non-Performing Arts Institute Secretaries where two candidates applied for each post. On 28th May, in a meeting chaired by the outgoing General Secretary, the interviews and elections were held with the outgoing core committee on the panel. After 1.5 hours of interviewing each for both the positions, Jitesh Sethi for Non-Performing Arts and Akhil Sagwal for Performing Arts were elected. The results were verified by the Senate and the incoming Institute Secretaries were introduced to the incoming core committee.",
      "While Kaustubh took measures to ensure that the need for veto does not occur again by discussing his vision and action plans with the candidates beforehand, a member of the outgoing core committee confessed, “ a minimally interactive 3 hour online meet was a cheap substitute for the original highly-interactive all-night long offline meet. The contrast was evident when we were told to keep the questions to the minimum.”",
      "“Absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely”",
      "This quote resonates strongly in the context of the veto rule implemented within the Student Gymkhana. The rule not only lacks the requirement for an explanation behind a veto decision but also lacks a mechanism to override such a decision, thereby negating the presence of checks and balances.",
      "At IITK, the value of equality and providing a voice to all has always been paramount. The establishment of the Student Gymkhana itself aimed to empower students to take charge of decision-making. This issue of Veto goes beyond a mere legal right mentioned in the Senate documents. It strikes at the core of a fundamental issue – a student’s removal from their elected position, undermining the values we hold dear. It’s a case of a student being removed from a post, a post to which he was voted into but was removed from, removed by a student peer because of a vaguely defined term – “Compatibility.”",
      "We firmly believe that accountability and transparency are fundamental pillars for the effective functioning of any organization. In the context of this incident, not only the absence of these principles is concerning but also the assertion that they undermine the purpose of the rule raises significant concerns and challenges its overall fairness.",
      "This scenario prompts students to question the path to personal growth and competence as the key to achieving our goals. We must recognize that a mindset, which places excessive emphasis on personal connections rather than knowledge and merit, erodes the values we cherish and hold dear.  It’s imperative to balance compatibility with credibility. Otherwise, students will focus more on the former than the latter, focusing less on what they know and more on who they know.",

      "Three beds in a room for two and two cupboards for three seem to be the‘new normal’for the campus residents. From lack of walking space in rooms, lack of chairs in mess to ceilings“almost”falling on one’s head, it is despairing to see how much of an anomaly has been normalised. Our team took a dive into the issue, talking to various stakeholders like Hall Executive Committees, workers, Gymkhana Executives, and the Associate Dean of Hostel Affairs. Read on to learn about the root problems and the current state of proposed solutions.",
      "As on August 2022, the campus had9289 residents. However, the current infrastructure provides space for only7141. This is primarily because of the increase in batch size of incoming UG and PG batches.",
      "Hall Allocation Policy (HAP) is a policy the student body representatives suggest to the Hall Allocation and Advisory Committee, the institute body responsible for handling hostel affairs. Last year, the Hall Allocation Policy was proposed in two parts: one with the scenario without the construction of Hall 14 and the second with Hall 14 in usage. It was initially expected that Hall 14 would be handed over for use by January’23. Following many delays, in the latest open house, the administration assured that it would finally be ready for occupation in June’23.",
      "",
      "Further changes in allocation occurred from what was proposed in HAP 2022-23 because of the following reasons:",
      "A projected number was sent for PhDs and MSRs, but the actual number was less as many students dropped out for better prospects.",
      "The actual number of Masters’ students was more than what was anticipated.",
      "The projected number of degree extensions was almost twice what was anticipated. (130 instead of 63)",
      "Currently, the occupancy status and capacity of different halls is shown by the given figurea.",
      "Three primary sources cater to a hall’s fund requirements: HEC, Hall Development Fund(HDF), and Dean’s Capital Fund(DCF). The DoSA office allots the DCF, which has reduced significantly in the last year.",
      "",
      "The argument given for reduction in DCF is that as the number of students in a hall has increased, the funds collected from the hostel fee have also increased. However, it is noteworthy that an increased student count also increases the need for resources for maintaining the hall. But due to the reduction of DCF, the total available funds for maintenance have reduced. Thus many halls still struggle with fund requirements for various amenities like washing machines, maintenance of common rooms, etc.",
      "",
      "The crunch manifests in more problems like a lack of room space to study. As many rooms currently accommodate more students than their capacity, there are fewer tables, cupboards, and available space in rooms than required for each member. Thus it is tough for many students to study in their rooms simultaneously. Other resources like mess facilities are also overloaded. Many feel that resources like washing machines need frequent repairs due to overuse.",
      "",
      "Due to the crunch, the current allocation of hostel rooms in many halls requires both PG and UG students to coexist, which has resulted in various complaints and issues. PG students have reported noise disturbances caused by UG students, while frequent room shifting has added to the inconvenience.",
      "",
      "Moreover, this year’s scheduled intake of winter PG students posed a challenge due to the severe crunch in the hostel space. Student representatives had suggested to the administration that either no admissions should be made this year or the first semester should be conducted online. Consequently, the institute had to limit the intake to only 100 students.",
      "Halls 1-4, built nearly 60 years ago, require timely repair and renovation. However, the most recent internal maintenance (painting and room restoration) was completed in 2009, and the most recent external maintenance was completed in 2011.",
      "",
      "Direct exposure to sunlight, rain, and water seepage through ceilings has weakened roofs and ceilings in old hostels. The dilapidated condition of these hostels came to light when falling plaster blocks became a common scene in Hall 3 a year ago. During last year’s monsoon, incidents of falling plaster damaging property and injuring students were reported. In one such complaint, a 2-by-2 chunk of plaster fell on a student’s bed- he got hit on the head, and his roommate’s phone was also damaged. To cover the incident, the institute offered compensation for the roommate’s phone. Similar incidents have been reported in Hall 2 as well. While the institute has taken some action, the repair and renovation process has been hindered by the rules and procedures in place.",
      "",
      "When action was required, the Department of Civil Engineering gathered a group of professors and requested a list of the affected rooms. It was decided that the plaster would be reapplied to the roofs of Halls 2 and 3. Although nothing happened for a while, subsequent monsoons saw similar incidents. Finally, after the end-semester exams in November, Hall 3 Hall Executive Committee(HEC) received an email asking them to vacate 51 rooms to allow the work to start. To understand how inefficient the whole process is, consider this case:",
      "",
      "Hall 3 HEC filled out form 101 (preliminary inspection) for interior and exterior maintenance back in (April 2022). Consequently, Institute Works Department’s (IWD) officials came to verify the complaint and concluded that the hall needed touch-ups in the common area. The HEC was asked to fill another 101(August 2022). The HEC had to fill three more 101s for external maintenance, interior maintenance, and repairing cracks. Currently, these forms are approved by the IWD and lie somewhere in the DoIP office. As for the 51 rooms, they have been promised to be handed over by themonsoon of 2023.",
      "",
      "According to President Hall 3, a reason why approvals take as long as they do is that the institute starts documentation in January to prepare for the annual audit (which takes place towards the end of March). Meanwhile, approvals are stretched over 6-7 months to save work and money.",
      "“The DoIP asks us to talk to the Dean, but even if the Dean approves, the DoIP sends officials for verification, pushing us back to square one. Tenures end without anything concrete happening.”",
      "-Hall 3, President",
      "To get the administration’s point of view on the issue, we contacted the Associate Dean, Hall Affairs (ADHA), in December 2022. On the question of the crunch, he informed us that it is impossible to relieve the crunch immediately. However, work is underway towards shifting third-year UGs to crunch-free accommodations by the next academic year.",
      "",
      "Regarding funding, he informed us that infrastructure funding is under the purview of DoIP while DCF is under the control of DoSA. The job of ADHA is to inform DoIP and DoSA about space requirements. To learn more about the funding and plans, we contacted the DoIP multiple times but didn’t get a response.",
      "",
      "Finally, when asked about the mishaps in Hall 3, the ADHA told us that renovation was underway in 51 rooms in Hall 3 and 28 rooms in Hall 2. DoIP has asked them to complete the renovation in two months and is working towards it. However, there are no plans right now for overall full-scale renovations. He added that there are plans to get Hall 13 and GH repainted because they represent the institute to parents.",
      "In the recent open house held on construction issues (here), the institute officials laid down their proposed future solutions to alleviate the residential crunch at the campus. In the open house, the administration emphasised that the institute faces challenges in gathering funds for hostel construction.",
      "",
      "This is primarily since the Ministry of Education stopped giving grants for hostel construction(or any construction or equipment). Therefore, the institute has to raise the money from its earnings over the maintenance cost it incurs. The institute depends on alum funding and Higher Education Financing Agency(HEFA) loans for hostel building. However, for loans, the application and paperwork take a long time. The ADPI further mentioned the long-term and short-term plans for releasing the crunch.",

Hall 12 was taken as an example to emphasise the point: it accommodates more students despite having the lowest plot area. ADPI said Halls 14, 15, and 16 would haveno sports facilities. However, it was ensured that the present facilities would be protected.",
      "",
      "On the girls’ residential crunch issue, it was further said that new hostels in 3-4 years would ultimately alleviate the situation in the long term.",
      "The infrastructure bottleneck has manifested itself in almost all facets of our campus life, from finding a chair in the mess and a walking space in your over-boarded room to falling ceilings and frequent room changes. It is perhaps one of the most critical concerns facing the campus—a problem that everyone not only knows about but is also a part of.",
      "",
      "Although the institute has proposed the construction of new hostels, their timely availability for accommodation is doubtful as construction dates have been delayed multiple times over the past few years. It is high time that promised solutions are delivered timely and other aspects of crunch like lack of space in academic area (library and spaces to study), overload on resources and workers are looked at.",

The residents had raised several problems, such as excessive noise and dust, loss of sports facilities, impact on green areas and open spaces, and a need for a corresponding increase in facilities. Above all, students were infuriated that the decision was undemocratic, i.e., students were not formally consulted for this construction.",

      "",
      "In the presentation to the students, the ADPI described the situation of the hostel crunch in detail and presented the authorities’ stance on the issue. He informed that a single block would be constructed in both halls combined. One-half of the block will be constructed in place of the basketball and badminton courts in GH-1, and the other half will be built in place of the volleyball court in Hall-4, eventually providing accommodation for 224 girls in total. The block is expected to be ready in 4 months. He stated that the construction must occur in GH-1 and Hall-4 at any cost to adjust for the increase in the number of girl students as the Y23 batch arrives. He added that the consequence of not building a block in the girls’ hostel is a severe crunch for girls in the next three years, or some students might have to look for accommodation outside the campus.",
      "",
      "The authorities also pointed out that the DoIP office is already working on long-term solutions to the crunch: the construction of Hall 14, Hall 15, and Hall 16. But as the number of undergraduate girl students is increasing every year, the DoIP office had to look for a short-term solution due to the shortage of time. The construction of a new block takes place much faster than the construction of a completely new hostel due to far less paperwork and the use of new technology for construction.",
      "",
      "Later the authorities gave a point-by-point reply to the concerns of GH-1 and Hall-4 residents. One, the sports facilities will be reconstructed within the respective halls at different places. Two, to address the issues of excessive noise and dust, health, and ventilation, the authorities agreed to relocate the affected students. Three, to address the security issue, the construction area would be completely isolated from the residential blocks, and hence there would be no movement of workers inside the hall. Moreover, construction will take place in two shifts, i.e., for 16 hours every day. Four, the expansion of complementary facilities like the mess, cycle stands, et cetera will take place. Five, according to the authorities, they had kept a democratic spirit as all the official processes for the construction were followed, and no systemic lapse occurred from their end. They stated that there is no official protocol to inform the hall residents about any construction taking place in their hall.",
      "",
      "In the Q&A session, when the GBM questioned the authorities about the lapses in communication from their side regarding the construction time and the meetings, the authorities agreed that there was a miscommunication and promised no further miscommunication. They asked the GBM to appoint a 3-member committee from both GH-1 and Hall-4, who will be the point of contact between the GBM and the authorities. This committee would meet the authorities weekly to discuss the residents’ concerns, and the relocation logistics and increase the transparency of the decisions the authorities are making about the construction.",
      "",
      "After the open house, the construction resumed in both the hostels. However, it is important to note that these incidents aren’t isolated. Residential infrastructure crunch is constantly causing huge issues to the campus residents daily. To know more about the crunch (problems, solutions, institute’s plan) stay tuned!",

      "The residents of GH-1 have raised concerns that the authorities have not adequately addressed them for more than a week. The consequence was two significant protests led by the residents of Hall 4 and GH-1.",
      "On the morning of March 26, residents of GH-1 were surprised by the sound of construction as workers began to demolish the basketball and badminton court to make way for a new block. According to the residents they weren’t informed or consulted about this development beforehand. However, it was built merely 4 meters from the current residing block, leading to concerns about their well-being, academic productivity, and a need for more communication from the HEC and authorities. The residents raised the following problems-",
      "After the construction began, the students’ hostility grew from small WhatsApp groups to more significant in-person discussions. After the residents raised questions, the hall president emailed the General Body Meeting (GBM) on the 27th of March, stating that the construction is for building a residential block to accommodate the increasing student strength. The mail also mentioned that the HEC was unaware of the “when and where” of the construction plans.",
      "After pressure from residents during an informal meet-up, the Hall President called for an urgent GBM on the 29th of March. After an hour of heated arguments with the HEC, the warden was called to address the residents’ concerns. Warden answered the resident’s queries and promised a meeting with the ADHA for further grievance. It was decided to halt the construction until further discussion with the authorities.",
      "On 30th March, the ADHA visited GH1 and agreed to discuss the concerns with the DoSA (Director of Student Affairs), DoIP (Dean of Infrastructure and Planning), and DD (Deputy Director). After the meeting, the warden sent a mail stating that the ADHA said it was impossible to stop the construction, but the authorities would consider the residents’ concerns. Around 300 residents signed a petition, which was decided to be presented in the meeting with the authorities.",
      "The construction resumed on 1st April. The meeting with the authorities was scheduled for the afternoon of the same day. The residents felt that the ADHA was unable to address the concerns raised by the GBM. However, the ADHA assured the residents that the construction would be running between 9 am to 6 pm.",
      "At night, when the construction didn’t stop until 11 pm, around 60 residents gathered in front of the hall in demand to talk to the administration. In the middle of this, the DoIP showed up to talk to the contractor. The residents alleged that after they confronted the DoIP for answers, he ran away while saying that he did not have to talk to the residents. At around 12:30 am, as more administration personnel failed to arrive, the entire crowd started to walk towards the director’s bungalow. The students had one significant demand: to have an open-house discussion with the concerned authorities.",
      "Around 2:30 am, the Security Chairman, J Ramkumar, arrived at the site to listen to their concerns. A meeting with all the officials was promised in the morning, but the students wanted written assurance from the Security Chairman about the next day’s meetings. They were only willing to talk to the DD, as they found the DoIP and ADHA unreliable. After a heated discussion, the final mail was sent by Prof. J Ramkumar to the PSG while copying the presidents of all the girls’ hostels, consisting of Hall 4, GH1, and Hall 6. The mail pointed out four points-",
      "As soon as the president of GH1 forwarded the mail to the residents, the crowd dispersed at 4 in the morning.",
      "As agreed upon in the mail, all residents gathered on GH1’s lawn the following afternoon at 2 pm. After an hour of waiting, the officials didn’t show up. The residents felt betrayed as the Security Chairman’s assurance was being rendered useless. The girls became impatient and started protesting in front of the GH1 gate. They set out for the Kargil Chowk to participate in yet another demonstration. They blocked the road entirely restricting the movement of vehicles.",
      "The PSG, CoSHA Convener, and GH-1 president came to the protest after a meeting with the authorities to convey the authorities’ message – that the residents should understand why such a construction is necessary, that the girl students in the future would have to live in a crunch.",
      "This made the residents furious on three levels- one, the authorities did not keep up to their promise and held a closed-door meeting without them; two, the authorities wanted girls to understand and adjust to the ongoing construction, not adequately engaging with the issues they raised; and three, although IITK is a premier institution, it could not a make timely projections about the number of incoming students and arrange the necessary accommodation.",
      "Being extremely frustrated with the authorities and the student representatives, the residents marched to the director’s bungalow. On the way, the residents caught the director in his car while returning from an event.  After a discussion with the director, he promised to send a mail regarding the open house to be held in a maximum of two days from today, and then the protesters dispersed. The director urged them to confront him in his office if the mail wasn’t delivered. They now hope to meet the director with the following demands:",
      "1. Stopping construction altogether in their halls. They urge the administration to look for long-term solutions like building/allocation of new hostels to girls.",
      "2. Restoration of sports facilities at their residences.",
      "To get a statement from the authorities, our team reached out to ADHA, to which no response was received at the time of publication.",
      "Stay tuned for further developments on the issue.",

      "The last decade in the Indian start-up ecosystem saw the rise of several unicorns – start-ups that reached a value worth a billion dollars. An integral part of this ecosystem and the culture of entrepreneurship in the country has been the list of IIT alumni, with firms building software to establishing household brands. The pandemic saw the rise of some of the more innovative startups from IIT Kanpur, like The Ventilator Project and E-spin Nanotech, that were in the headlines. Urban Company and Sharechat have grown to become names synonymous with the start-up space in the country, both being led by founders from IIT Kanpur. In this article that follows, the Vox team aims to de-construct and investigate the start-up ‘culture’ on campus and bring forth an idea about what it takes to build from scratch, and scale up, whilst being an IIT Kanpur student.",
      "Starting a venture as a student is one of those unpredictable roads that always brings forth a sense of excitement as well as uncertainty. In our efforts to investigate the start-up space at our campus, we reached out to the Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre(SIIC). We interviewed budding entrepreneurs and faculty administration to discuss the institute’s policies and what lies ahead for the student entrepreneurs.",
      "The journey for each entrepreneur on campus has been different, but the struggles shape a generalised pattern. One such entrepreneur we interviewed was Kshitiz, a third-year undergraduate, who has been trying to find like-minded people to form a team for his startup idea but remarked about the lack of help from the administration and the academic load having put this idea on a halt. He mentions that some help was provided through Student Mentorship Program (SMP) conducted by E-Cell. Still, the inability to get proper direction or a team has led him to push away this idea for further pursuit after graduation.",
      "Vox interviewed another student of IITK who has successfully registered his company, Arun (founder of Pnapaao). He has always wanted to develop a business of his own, and so the main purpose for his joining IITK was to avail access to more resources and easy availability of financial support, but he too had to experience plenty of hurdles to establish his company. The lack of primal necessities to build up a team and the constant juggling between academics and entrepreneurship made him suffer academically. Eventually, he did form a team through personal contacts and built his company in Noida instead of incubating at SIIC. To ease the process of starting up a company (deriving the motivation from his own journey), he developed Pnapaao, a company that helps budding startups in all ways possible- team formation, marketing, and consulting. Pnapaao has grown to be a steady venture and is on its way to becoming a successful startup now.",
      "A few entrepreneurs at IITK do get on the path to success and realize their ambitions. We also talked to Tanmay Yadav, an IITK alumnus and a successful entrepreneur to know more about his struggles as well as his journey to establish CRUBN.",
      "As a freshman, Tanmay was fascinated by the idea of blockchains, which came with its own set of challenges. Being a student from a non-CSE background, pursuing software engineering was a cumbersome task, meanwhile, there were no courses on blockchain technology being offered at that time. After some self-learning through online courses, Tanmay approached Prof. Sandeep Shukla for a project where he learned more about the various aspects of blockchains and how they could create an impact on society. Joined by Mukul,(Co-founder and Managing Director, CRUBN) who was also working under Prof Shukla at the time, he participated in a Microsoft Hackathon and devised a solution to the given problem statement, which eventually won the competition. This is how the journey of CRUBN began. The next task on hand was funding for which they went to Google and a few other places that also included some government organizations. They finally got funding from the National Security Council, providing them with a good corpus for their initiative. However, it wasn’t always smooth sailing, there were some roadblocks as well in his startup journey. One of the incidents that Tanmay vaguely recollects was when their team was working on a land records management problem using blockchain. They worked on the technology and spent nearly two years trying to pitch their idea to various state governments but it didn’t lead to fruition as the state administrations weren’t fully aware of the notion of blockchain back then. Continuing their research, they refined their model, looking at instances of the domain worldwide, and gave a final presentation to one of IITK’s alumni bureaucrats in Karnataka. However, soon after, covid hit the world. The company was founded on the 13th, and on the 21st of March 2020, a nationwide lockdown was unexpectedly declared. Suddenly, the whole world was battling covid, and everything else got sidelined. After a long halt for the company and the team, in December, they finally got a call from the same bureaucrat, discussing the possibility of them giving the presentation again. Thrilled, they prepared for the presentation which was scheduled for the very next day. Surprisingly, an hour before the meeting, it was declared in all the newspapers throughout Karnataka that IITK’s blockchain team would be doing land records management in Karnataka. And this was how CRUBN got its first project. Tanmay also mentions support from IITK as one of the building blocks to his success. He feels that SIIC and E-Cell are some of the bodies that do help budding startups but there is much more scope within policies and other domains that can be provided to help entrepreneurs.",
      "To know more about these provisions and policies as well as get a temperament of startup spirit and enthusiasm on campus, we interviewed Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, Professor-In-Charge (Incubation and Innovation). According to Prof. Bandhopadhyay, SIIC is the startup incubation center that helps budding entrepreneurs and provides them with the offices, mentors, and resources to get a headstart. The acceptance is based on the evaluation of the proposal submitted and an interview round held by a committee that also includes an expert faculty in the subject matter of the startup. A company is declared successful if it has been sustainable till five years of formation. The success rate of the startups incubated at SIIC is stated to be 59%.",
      "Despite this, many students do not incubate their companies at SIIC. Some of them had an issue with the equity demanded, which is vaguely stated in the contract as “mandatory 5% and extra”, the extra being decided by the committee on various criteria. Prof. Bandhopadhyay, in this regard, stated that “ If the student is taking advantage of the university by spending its resources or nurturing that company, it is fair that IIT Kanpur gets some share in the company hence it is well deserving”. On being asked about the lacking effort from the students’ end, Prof Bandhopadhyay highlighted that among students, the motivation for owning a business is more than that of solving a problem. Hence they tend to formulate a solution without identifying the problem and not the other way around.",
      "Despite the existence of SIIC, E-Cell, and multiple policies in place to support entrepreneurship, throughout the interview process, the issues that were raised by entrepreneurs were:",
      "Tanmay, commenting on these highlighted problems, recollects finding a team through the project he took up for blockchains. While for the academic load, he mentions that he had to complete his graduation in 7 semesters so that he could give more time to the company. Handling academics under such circumstances was not easy, and his CPI got affected as well. He focuses on the fact that handling academics and working on a startup simultaneously can be difficult. He advises entrepreneurial enthusiasts – “Going past the ideation phase is the most significant step for many people who are starting up. People should not hesitate to discuss their ideas with colleagues. You’ll find excellent people on campus who can give you very pragmatic criticism of your idea. The journey is not easy, but it’s very rewarding. KEEP FIGHTING AND KEEP THINKING. “",

      "The Hall VI HEC (Hall Executive Committee) Elections – scheduled to be conducted on 2nd March 2023 – were cancelled just 30 minutes before the polling was set to begin – on the recommendation of the outgoing HEC!",
      "In an email received by the residents of H6, the Warden In-Charge of Hall VI informed that she endorsed the recommendation of the outgoing HEC to cancel the elections for the post of President, Hall 6, and that renominations would be sought when elections are conducted at a later date (post 15 March).[1]",
      "The outgoing President of H6 claimed that both the candidates contesting for President, H6 were severely under-prepared. For example, she recounted that one of the candidates did not know who the hall warden was during the soapbox, while the other named the hall manager when asked. Based on multiple such instances, the Warden In-Charge, in consultation with the HEC, decided to not have the elections with such a low level of preparation and instead give the candidates more time to prepare.",
      "The President also claimed that there were far too many similarities between the manifestos of the Hall VI and Hall V HEC candidates (where HEC elections were recently concluded). She further added that there were eerie similarities between the manifestos of the two candidates as well – for example, both of them had coincidentally forgotten to include any plans on festivities, cultural activities and hall day, but included them in the budget.[2][3]. The President alleged that it was the CEO’s (Chief Election Officer, H6 Elections) responsibility to look at these issues during ratification of manifestos but they were overlooked.",
      "According to the Chief Election Officer (CEO) for H6 HEC elections, the two presidential candidates were ‘unfairly’ accused by the outgoing HEC, of plagiarising manifestos of Hall 5 HEC candidates and were repeatedly asked to take back their nominations. When the candidates did not comply, the Hall President called one of them to her room and asked her to step down for reasons such as going for a summer internship and not having a good enough CPI, alleged one of the candidates.",
      "The CEO claimed that after the soapbox, the HEC asked her to shift the polling day. When she did not comply, an HEC member screamed at her and forced her to make the change. This was reverted back to the original date once the Students’ Gymkhana intervened.",
      "When asked for comment, the Hall President told us, “The HEC discussed that the candidates got only 2 days for campaigning – on one of which most of them had an exam, so they should be given another day for campaigning. Since we did not find any rule against this in the Code of Conduct, we approached the CEO with this proposal. The CEO of H6 elections had initially agreed to send out an email, but later reneged after talking to the CEO of the Election Commission. When we appointed a CEO, we placed trust in her, but when we realised that she was being unduly influenced by a senior, the scenario changed.”",
      "It may be noted that the CEO of the Election Commission was the proposer of one of the candidates. The outgoing President believes this shouldn’t have been allowed at the time of filing nominations, but the CEO of H6 elections overlooked this as well.",
      "As a last resort, the HEC approached the Warden In-Charge and recommended that the elections for the post of President be cancelled. The CEO and the candidates were not made aware of this and only got to know of the cancellation once they received the email.",
      "After the email was sent, the CEO met the Warden to ask for the rationale behind cancelling the elections. The Warden allegedly said that the candidates were ‘ill-prepared’ and hence, she was giving them more time to prepare. Vox team contacted the warden to confirm the statement and ask for a comment. However, we did not receive a reply by the time of publication.",
      "Both the presidential candidates have denied copying from Hall 5 HEC manifestos and further asserted that their manifestos were ratified by the CEO (Chief Election Officer).",
      "“I believe such scrapping of elections is extremely undemocratic because if we were genuinely incapable of winning the elections, then NOTA would have prevailed. That decision should be taken by the GBM and not the HEC. If they just want the person they like to be the next president, then why hold elections at all? Just take interviews”, one of the candidates told us.",
      "Several questions need to be confronted in this regard: What should be the extent of involvement or influence of the outgoing HEC during HEC elections? Are they supposed to make value judgment on the under-preparedness of the candidates? Or is it for the GBM (General Body Members) to decide if the candidates are good enough? Even if the candidates are under-prepared, is it under the HEC’s or Warden’s mandate to call off the elections, without the consent of the Chief Election Officer?",
      "Vox opines that the incident in Hall 6 points to the sheer disregard of the democratic spirit of elections. It, moreover, sets a dangerous precedent for the years to come because",
      "(a) Arbitrary justifications may be used against candidates disfavoured by the outgoing HEC",
      "(b) The Warden assumed the authority to cancel the elections without consulting the Chief Election Officer of the Hall or giving the candidates a chance to disagree.",

      "“Student representation is important for the overall development of students, so university statutes should make it clear that students can be represented.” -Lyndogh commission.",
      "However, various questions have been raised on the EC’s efficacy in conducting ‘free-and-fair’ elections. Broadly, these questions may be divided into three themes: one, on the restrictive and ambiguous nature of the Code of Conduct; two, on ethical and legal problems with proofs and interrogation processes; three, on structural issues in the constitution of Election-related bodies (EC, GRC, AGRC). Vox team dives deeper into each of these and presents findings from our conversations with former election candidates and EC members. The article intends to critique elections in IITK as a structure and not the specific people involved in the Election Commission and its processes.",
      "The Code of Conduct (COC) issued by the EC defines a set of rules on what is allowed and not allowed during elections at IITK. However, there are various issues with how the Code of Conduct applies currently:",
      "",
      "Firstly, multiple candidates complained that the penalties are decided on a case-to-case subjective basis as there are no clear guidelines on what violation attracts what penalty. It is easy to find multiple candidates violating the same clause of the CoC but being subjected to different levels of fine, ranging from mere warning to cancellation of nomination. One of the solutions proposed was the appointment of a bench of 3 CEOs instead of one.",
      "",
      "Ex-Chief Election Officer, Prince Joel was of the view that not only the offence, but also the impact of the offence determines the fine imposed. Hence, he believed that compiling an exhaustive list of breaches is impossible as there will always be ways to get around it. As a result, the rules are written so as to allow the list to be enlarged as necessary. The present Chief Election Officer (CEO) also confirmed that the COC is flexible and dynamic and the rules are relaxed or imposed on a case-to-case basis.",
      "Secondly, an issue that resonated with a number of candidates was that there should be a specified duration for which a fine from the COC can be imposed on them; they found it unjust to be punished for something they did long before the elections.“You can’t expect a person to know the code of conduct at that point, ie, 6 months or 2 months before.”One of the former candidates believes that if any major rules were broken before the election, the Gymkhana or Institute rules – and not the EC- should be in charge.",
      "",
      "Samiksha Jaiswal, the present Chief Election Officer (CEO), rebutted the allegations by claiming that anyone who broke the rules before the Code of Conduct was put into effect were told about it right away. Even though the action is carried out later, a warning is given right away.",
      "",
      "Thirdly, the COC says that any form of anti-campaigning is penalizable. Various students have found this restrictive as they feel one should be free to discuss shortcomings and negatives of other candidates, to make a responsible choice. When we asked the EC, they clarified that the candidate can be criticized based on their manifesto, and their present or past PORs, but personal remarks or soliciting votes against a candidate would count as anti-campaigning and attract a penalty.",
      "",
      "Fourthly, former candidates found the monetary nature of the fines concerning as it puts people from well-to-do backgrounds at an apparent advantage. On this the CEO said, “This issue is being reviewed in the Senate. We haven’t been able to implement community service as an alternative to monetary punishments yet. Of the possible options, Prayas gave a negative review and NSS cannot be used as punishment.”",
      "Firstly, the proofs that the EC collects consist of mostly audio/video recordings or chat screenshots of candidates/GBMs- taken and used without their consent (and in most cases, even without their knowledge). This method of collecting proofs raises serious concerns on breach of privacy as the EC has virtually assumed consent to record any conversations of any member of the student community for purposes of catching violations.",
      "",
      "When we quizzed the EC officials on the issue, they rebutted by saying that access to the sensitive information is restricted to the Chief Election Officer and the person who recorded it – with the entire database stored on a cloud platform – such that only the CEO has access to it.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the proof is never shown to the candidate being penalized, to protect the identity of the proof-provider. The proofs, if need be, are submitted only to the Grievance Redressal Committee(GRC) and the Appellate Grievance Redressal Committee(AGRC) for scrutiny. The only details revealed to the candidate/GBM are clauses of the Code of Conduct violated by them. A former candidate said that he was unable to defend the allegations against him in the GRC as he did not know the proof on whose basis his nomination was canceled. But he was rendered helpless due to EC’s policy.",
      "",
      "A former candidate also pointed out that since the proof is accessible to only a few – if they anyhow try to tamper or manipulate the contents of it, there’s absolutely no check in place to prevent this from happening.",
      "In case a candidate wants to contest the decision of the EC, they may file a complaint with the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC). The GRC – consisting of two professors and three student members – is supposed to act as a failsafe mechanism for any mistakes or biases of the EC. Once the GRC re-investigates the issue and gives its decision, if the candidate is still unsatisfied, they can approach the Appellate Grievance Redressal Committee (AGRC) for another investigation. Such an elaborate mechanism exists to infuse necessary checks and balances for any manipulation of the EC. However, despite that, the general consensus among former candidates was that they never got a fair opportunity to defend themselves in the redressal committees.",
      "The indirect involvement and unreasonable influence of the Chairperson, Students’ Senate and the President, Student Gymkhana in the elections has been a common grievance for many previous candidates.",
      "",
      "Firstly, the Chief Election Officer (CEO) is selected by a panel composed of the outgoing CEO, President and the Chairperson. Secondly, the 3 student members nominated to the GRC are selected by the nomination committee of the Senate. The President is the convenor of the committee and the Chairperson is an ex-officio member. Thirdly, as observed in the past, typically the Chairperson and the ex-CEO are nominated to the GRC.",
      "",
      "Hence, such a structure steers clear of any division of power and instead allows the current position holders to pull all the strings. Moreover, former candidates we talked to don’t trust the GRC as a failsafe mechanism against any biases of the EC – as the same position holders who are pulling the strings at the EC, are members of the GRC.",
      "",
      "An ex-candidate whose nomination was canceled remarked that as the then Chairperson wasn’t very fond of him, he, along with the ex-CEO (GRC member) and then CEO, fabricated proofs against him. As the Chairperson was also a part of the GRC, he claims that there was no way to stop this abuse of power. Although it must be noted that the names of the student members of the GRC are presented in the pre-conduction report of the Elections in the Senate and any contentions can be raised on the floor of the Senate.",
      "",
      "Another candidate suggested that the CEO should be chosen via discussion and voting in the Senate, just like the CoSHA Convener or Chairperson are elected in the Senate. This method could make the process more transparent and induce a sense of faith in the neutrality of the EC.",
      "",
      "An ex-CEO, who was also a GRC member, pointed out,“the issue is that the Senate doesn’t make the GRC properly. When you see the Chairperson or the ex-CEO in the GRC, even if they may not be biased in the meetings, but they are perceived to be biased in the eyes of the people.The Senate should choose people who are connected to the Senate and active in the student body, but not directly related to the EC or any candidates.”",
      "Hence, the elections and its associated processes and structures are riddled with a number of nuanced problems. As a student community, we must indulge in answering these complex questions: how should the Code of Conduct set a balance between allowing healthy debates and discussions while avoiding any nuisance? What safeguards may be put in place to make sure the EC does not breach the privacy of students? How can the structure of selections and nominations in Election-related bodies be evolved to ensure appropriate checks and balances and shield the EC from undue influence of any one set of people?",

      "While on the one hand we see a recurrent narrative about the inequality in college cutoffs, internships and placements; on the other hand are apprehensions about casual sexism, unwarranted doubts about one’s competence and jeopardised opportunities. Buried under this chaos are also the unheard complaints of the non-binary for whom even acknowledgement of their problems – keep aside resolution – seems to be an uphill task.",
      "Vox team conducted an anonymous survey to dive deep into the issue and know what the campus thinks. The survey received 494 responses, with about 75% male, 22% female, and 3% non-binary responses. To present the complete picture on the issue, we talked to the Women’s Cell, alumni, Gymkhana executives and a few individuals who reached out to us with their cases. Here are the findings from the survey and our conversations:",
      "A significant portion of the male respondents raised concerns regarding the reservation for female students at colleges and alleged that females are favoured by TAs and tutors. The woes of disadvantages of female favouritism extended to club recruitment and company hiring as well. Furthermore, about 40% males found the Women’s Cell unapproachable, according to our survey. Some comments that supported these notions were:",
      "Multiple respondents alleged lack of cognizance in cases of harassment of boys. Invasion of personal space in hostels and the shame associated with pointing it out were some common issues. Further, respondents expressed disappointment regarding the lack of support from the Women’s Cell in such cases.",
      "Moreover, the male population overwhelmingly believed that the Women’s Cell is biassed towards females. Many respondents expressed that they are vulnerable to being subjected to false implications through the Women’s Cell.",
      "A few male respondents were also cognizant of the difficulties faced by their female friends. They highlighted how sometimes sexism was a common element across male-only groups.",
      "In response to why they felt the campus has prevalent sexism, many female respondents shared that they regularly confront sexist comments and remarks. Comments like“You’ll definitely get a job”,“Hall 6 won only because boys helped them”and“You got here because you were a girl”made them feel inferior and unworthy.",
      "",
      "Multiple female students shared with us instances wherein the Gymkhana, the Senate or particular coordinators of certain clubs believed that girl students are incompetent of leading. In particular, respondents alleged that girls applying for festival coordinators are reasoned off by saying that the vendors won’t listen to a girl.",
      "",
      "Another female student we talked to alleged the current President, Students’ Gymkhana for passing sexist remarks casually. She told us,",
      "Both male and female students also pointed out cases of some Professors passing sexist remarks in classes. In one such incident, a Professor said, “In developed countries, women work and take care of their physical appearance. Housewives in India are not only fat but also ugly and spend their entire day watching TV serials.” He also went on to say that a female sanitary worker in the western world looks better than bollywood heroines. Many respondents felt these remarks were not only sexist but also made them uncomfortable.",
      "",
      "Incidents like these, especially involving people in positions of power, show how deeply rooted sexism is in our ‘culture’. However, it must also be noted that around 32% of girls feel that the campus is not sexist.",
      "",
      "Another serious concern raised by the female community was uncomfortable behaviour of guys in front of them. Many girls told us that it is challenging to have a neutral conversation with a boy as most seem driven by obscure intentions. Unnecessary attention that girls receive was disturbing for multiple respondents.",
      "",
      "On the issue of alleged favouritism of females at IITK, some respondents found it vital so as to encourage more women to get opportunities in STEM. The same was said for club recruitment.",
      "In the survey, non-binary conforming gender responses constituted 3% of the responses received. Out of them, 50% felt unsafe expressing their gender identity on campus.",
      "",
      "Despite conducting several gender identity sensitisation sessions to promote healthy interactions in the campus community, athird of the respondents affirmed that there were incidents where people mocked them for their identity. They felt that their gender identity posed a problem in campus interactions and during internship and placement drives. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that they were at a disadvantage because they did not conform to any of the binary genders.",
      "",
      "Another concern that came up recurrently in our investigation echoed here: The name Women’s Cell for a gender-neutral support body was alienating for many.",
      "The Chairperson, Students’ Senate, agreed that sexism existed in many subtle forms on the campus. For example, he pointed out that many clubs were not ready to take rooms in the Girls’ Hostels merely because they found it inconvenient. While in contrast, many clubs have their rooms in boys’ hostels.",
      "",
      "Kartikeya Dhakad, the ex-Chairperson Students’ Senate, also noted that the location of clubs’ and teams’ rooms in the boys’ hostels, especially those of the SnT council, impedes female participation due to reduced accessibility.",
      "",
      "To better understand the scenario, our team analysed the participation of students in Councils and the Senate. Based on the ratification list, female students made less than a quarter of the ratified position holders across councils, Senate and festivals. In particular, SnT Council, Students’ Senate and Festivals fared worse than other student bodies. It may however be noted that the following data is based on the ratification lists, which does not entirely capture how many females and males actually participated in club/fest activities.",
      "Multiple executives pointed out that one of the primary reasons for the reduced female participation in the Senate and Councils is the lack of culture and exposure within the Girls’ Hostels.",
      "Kartikeya (ex-Chairperson, Students’ Senate) however pointed out that the low percentages in the Senate could be a one-time event, and we might see an increase in the future. He emphasised that the quality of people participating in a particular election is crucial in determining female participation in the Senate. He shared how during his tenure, some people were against the appointment of a female Chief Election Officer. He recounts hearing:“Vo ladki hai, voh ese decisions le hi nahi sakti kabhi”. \nOn questions on the Women’s Cell and the need for a gender cell, Kartikeya responded that adiversity cell existsalthough it is dysfunctional.",
      "",
      "To fact-check the recurrent narrative about girls being favoured over boys during internship and placement seasons, we analysed the internship and placement data (for Phase 1 in 2022-23). We found that the female to male recruitment ratio was 1:3.5. To put it in perspective, the female to male population ratio in IITK is about 1:4.28.",
      "Some of the recent alumni we talked to said that the narrative is created because some companies tend to ‘overcompensate’ for the lack of women in core engineering fields. Additionally, they said the issue is hyped by the people who are not selected and tend to find loopholes.",
      "To know the Women’s Cell’s perspective, our team talked to Professor Sarani Saha, the current Chairperson, Women’s Cell and Professor Jonaki Sen, the ex-Chairperson, Women’s Cell. They pointed out that sexism is prevalent in all stratas of the society, and the student community at IITK is no different. We are supposed to put our father/husband’s names in almost all government forms – this, they said, is an example of the systemic nature of the issue.",
      "",
      "Prof. Jonaki Sen had this to say when asked about the cause of such prevalent sexism on campus:",
      "On the significant lack of female participation in SnT and GnS councils compared to AnC and MnC councils, Prof. Sarani Saha suggested that this could stem from societal biases that women are better suited for specific roles and activities opposed to others. The skewed gender ratio in such councils could also act as a deterrent to their participation. She highlights that healthy participation is required for gender-inclusive policy formation and increased gender sensitisation. Further, in any setup, an individual feels more inclined to engage if there are companions and role models that they can relate to.",
      "",
      "We also talked to the professors about how supernumerary seats, lenient cutoffs for girls and diversity hiring in internships and placements contribute to the prejudice that girls are not at par with boys or are inferior. Prof. Jonaki Sen claimed that such policies are required to patch the ‘leaky pipeline’ and improve female representation. By ‘leaky pipeline’, she referred to the gradual reduction (or ‘leakage’) in the number of female students from undergrad to PhD levels and further in faculty positions.",
      "",
      "However, Prof. Sen said that such policies need to be implemented with a grain of salt. She believed that the benefits of such policies should be limited to first-generation college-going females. Suppose the mother is already doing well professionally; in that case, the daughter probably should not be allowed to avail of the policies to the same extent.",
      "",
      "On the issue of perceived bias of the Women’s Cell in favour of the women (as apparent from our survey), Prof. Jonaki Sen clarified that as an awareness wing, the Women’s Cell caters to the needs of students across all genders and sexuality. And that Women’s Cell is meant solely for females is a misconstrued idea. Furthermore, she clarified that a harassment rule mandates equal privilege in approaching the ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) for both males and females in cases of harassment. Prof. Sarani Saha, welcomed the idea of renaming the Women’s cell to a more gender-neutral name and said that the cell would consider the same.",
      "As per our survey, the major deterrent in approaching Women’s Cell were prevalent reputation about the inaction of Women’s Cell in major cases and the risk of the victim’s identity being revealed. To this, Prof. Sarani Saha responded, “In my tenure as an ICC member (Internal Complaints Committee) for three years, I have seen complaints being treated with utmost urgency – barring the COVID-induced delays in procedures. This happens because we work on a deadline to close complaints within three months of filing.”",
      "Thereby, she said that the reservations about the inefficiency of the Women’s Cell and the ICC are unwarranted. Moreover, she claimed that the confidentiality of the victim’s identity is respected throughout the process and stressed on the dire need for victims to complain as it sets a precedent for the accused.",
      "Prof. Jonaki Sen told us that the number of complaints of sexual harassment has gone up, which shows that more people are cognizant of the importance of speaking up. “This is a massive milestone for Women’s Cell as an educating body. To improve the effectiveness of sessions, the Cell is also planning to hold cognisance sessions department-wise,” she added.",
      "",
      "According to both the faculty members, the biggest challenge for the Women’s Cell is the abysmal participation of campus residents in the awareness sessions organised. Prof. Sen suggested making attendance compulsory for students as well as faculty members in department-wise awareness sessions. Prof. Sarini Saha highlighted the use of social media to gain more traction and plans to use it to create greater awareness on such issues.",
      "In conclusion, the question of sexism on campus is nuanced and multi-faceted. Measures taken in the name of fighting sexism are often seen as sexist by the other side. But two things are clear from our study: one, our merit island is far from ideal – sexism is deeply rooted in our campus community; two, we need more public conversation around sexism. For we are still seeking consensus on crucial questions like: is reservations for females or diversity hiring sexism or anti-sexism? Are ideas of ‘representation’ and ‘equality’ opposite ends to a spectrum or consistent with each other?",

      "IIT Kanpur, one of the country’s finest flagship residential campuses, housing over 8000 students, numerous workers, faculty members, and their families from all over the country, is naturally not immune to ailments and medical emergencies. The IIT Kanpur Health Center is the central body that looks into the ailments of our residents. With over 15 doctors listed on its website, we also have specialists visiting the center from time to time. Our campus is a community in itself, and the campus community’s health must be well catered to. Following several developments and grievances around the Health Centre, the Vox team decided to investigate what the ground reality and public perception were concerning the Health Centre. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a statement from the HC officials regarding the matter, despite multiple attempts.",
      "In a survey answered by 187 participants, we found out that the most voted option answering the questionHow often do you visit the Health Center?, was that of emergencies. Less than 10% of the respondents stated that they visited the HC more frequently (two to five times a month), mainly to look after chronic illnesses. The most common reasons for visiting the HC were simple injuries, flu, food poisoning, etc.",
      "When asked what the campus felt about the services provided by the HC, over 50% of the respondents claimed to have a certain level of dissatisfaction with the services provided by the Health Center. Let us take a look at what the respondents have to say-",
      "One of the most frequently mentioned problems was regarding the unavailability of doctors, or the delay/waiting time for appointments. In principle, the Health Centre is supposed to ensure that a second doctor is available as a substitute in a particular shift, and that has seemingly not been the case in the way the HC has operated post-pandemic. There have been quite a few complaints about the waiting time or the working hours of the Health Centre, but due to constraints of resources, we were told that the problem boils down to choosing between increasing the working hours or having backups during emergency hours.",
      "About 10% of the respondents claimed that the officials were rude and judgemental and that they had been denied treatment when they approached the HC during emergency hours.",
      "In a recent incident, a student who visited the Health Center psychiatrist stated that he was treated very rudely and impolitely and that the psychiatrist didn’t even bother looking at him, much less making him feel welcome during the visit.",
      "“I had an emergency once, and the emergency contact numbers of the HC were not reachable”, another student told us. “I went there, in a very distressed state, and on reaching the center, I was told that this problem had been going on for 10 days. Apparently, they had registered a complaint too but nothing was being done. After that, I was given an alternative number, not available on the site or anywhere else.”",
      "Many such examples, concerning the rude treatment of the doctors and the staff at the Health Center, were found in the survey. The respondents stated the officials are rude, arrogant, and ignorant, and hinted that they were annoyed by the patients, or were indifferent, to say the least.",
      "However, we also found out that a similar number of survey respondents held the opinion that the waiting time was standard and the services were satisfactory. They stated that the staff was regular, helpful, and punctual, and the ambulance service was stated to be very reliable in case of emergencies.A student additionally mentioned that the HC helped him arrange for an ambulance and the related arrangements in an accident outside the campus.One of the respondents said that the HC even delivered medicines to their room due to the medication being previously unavailable. Another quoted, “We should be satisfied with the health facilities provided by the institute. Not everyone has access to such facilities, and we should be thankful for what we have”.",
      "Coming to the quality of treatments, there were some claims about extreme medications being advised by the Health center. A couple of respondents claimed that the specialists were hasty and overlooked a lot of symptoms before prescribing medication. We also received responses claiming that they had been prescribed a heavy dosage, for instance, one respondent claimed that he had been given three injections to cure dehydration.",
      "However, contrary to the opinions stated above, only about 20% of the respondents felt that way.  In the survey, one respondent claimed that doctors often went out of their way to help with the treatment, familiarised themselves with the doctors back home, and make arrangements with the hospitals outside the campus to make the treatment more accessible. A few doctors were also listed as polite and welcoming, and their treatment was claimed to be more than satisfactory.",
      "",
      "In general, we received a lot of negative feedback based on the quality of treatment, the general conduct of the doctors, the (in)adequacy of technology, and the working hours. Many respondents also complained about the HC pharmacy always being out of stock.",
      "However, an anonymous source stated",
      "“There are a lot of people with preconceived notions about the HC who criticize it for no reason. This happens due to the nature of the field. Bad treatments are amplified and talked about while good treatments are never talked about.”",
      "In the responses, we also received a few complaints regarding the Apollo Pharmacy. To look into these complaints, we interviewed the Apollo Pharmacy supervisor. When asked why the pharmacy was frequently short on essentials such as Odomos, Sanitizers, and Electral, he stated that the quantity needed for these items is never definite. “We keep just enough stock so that none of it expires, otherwise we find that a lot of the stock goes to waste, which we cannot afford. We do not keep a buffer stock. Whenever the stock is depleted we order them, and they’re here in a day or so.”",
      "We were told that an Apollo application exists, through which we can order medicines and have them delivered to the room in the daytime. Apollo24x7  helps you order and pay via UPI, and then directly collect the items at the Health Center.",
      "There were numerous complaints about the failure of the online payment system of the Health Center and their treatment of students.",
      "I practically yelled and slammed their desks and they continued to ignore me as if I didn’t exist.I had gone there to get sanitary pads in the early morning, I paid twice, but their system was not working, and they simply chose to ignore me after that. I went back three times, only to get a different excuse every time, and finally got my refund on my fourth attempt.",
      "Another student said, “I believe that having an alternative to Apollo Pharmacy will create competition in the market. I hope that at least that would act as an incentive to treat the students right and keep the meds stocked up at all times.”",
      "In the survey, we asked students if they were aware of the insurance policy of the Health Center. Shockingly, we found out that over 50% of the respondents were unaware of the insurance policy at IITK. Although there are no complaints regarding this matter, we thought it best to make the student community aware of the benefits offered by the institute.",
      "There exists an insurance policy for the IIT Kanpur students, by which we can reimburse all the medical costs expended in any external hospitals. The Health center takes care of the costs endured by the students when visiting external hospitals. According to a source, 70% of the Insurance Fund is currently getting claimed by the students. The policy is availed by default, even without involvement from the insuree, which means that students can claim it even if they aren’t aware of the specifics of the policy. Interestingly, it was brought to our notice that our institute’s insurance policy was one of the few insurance policies in institutes that also covered the pandemic casualties.",
      "The insurance policy of our institute applies to any hospital in Kalyanpur, however, a cashless transaction exists in only a few. In the rest of the hospitals, students need to pay the amount first and then claim the reimbursement. These hospitals include the Madhuraj hospital, which is mainly recommended by the HC. As far as private hospitals go, the quality of treatment is a little on the spotty side, but it has a better rapport with the HC. The Regency hospital is the largest private hospital and offers a much better quality of treatment, however, it has a much longer waiting time, and it asks for an extra amount for the treatment, which is not included in the insurance. Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital (formerly Hallet Hospital), is the government hospital recommended by the health center.",
      "The Insurance policy gets modified every year. Reforms are suggested and debated by a committee that approves them.There exists an amount of about 1.5 lacks of direct coverage and about 1 lakh rupees in corporate bufferPremium amounts change, and so does the coverage amount. These changes are usually informed to the residents via email. However, we can always get to know more about the insurance on the health center’swebsite.",
      "Coming to the possible improvements to overcome these difficulties, it was suggested in the survey that the HC should work towards increasing students’ awareness of the health-related protocols on campus, including information about the health and insurance policies, the HC rules and regulations, and the HCUC (The Health Centre Users Committee).",
      "Following the aftermath of the pandemic, the functioning of the HC has changed dynamically. While some things have improved, certain aspects of the way of operating the facility have also become inconsistent. The HCUC has also been sporadic in its meetings and the lack of a feedback mechanism in place for the HC has been a point of concern of late.",
      "It was brought to our notice that the HC has been revamping facilities deployed, and technological advancements have been planned to digitize the maintenance of records. These changes should improve the day-to-day operations at the HC and also help in streamlining the experience for campus residents.",
      "To conclude, the Health Center is arguably far from perfect, but it stands to be a capable institute center. The falling standards of the services offered seem to be one of the problems that plague it. We hope that the improvements in the quality of treatment and the services provided by the HC  go hand in hand with the advancements in technology. Hopefully, the near future ahead should bring a more efficient and improvised Health Centre Experience.",

      "Disclaimer: The following article’s content is comprised of excerpts quoted from the current Post-graduate Academic Review Committee (PGARC) Report, 2020-21. As per a note mentioned within the report, all recommendations and data used have been for pre-pandemic conditions, and the effect or considerations arising out of the pandemic are beyond the scope of the present report.",
      "The first academic review of the PG Programme (PGP) was presented to the Academic Senate in December 2012 amid growing emphasis in the Institute on the centrality of the PGP. The latest review is thus the Second PG Academic Review. The report was prepared by a panel of members that included: Prof. Amitabha Bandopadhyay, Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava, Prof. Nisant N. Nair, Prof. Parasar Mohanty, Prof. Prashant Bagad, Prof. Sameer Khandekar, Prof. Sarani Saha, Prof. Sri Vanamalla V., Mr Vineeth Vijayan (Student Representative), and Prof. Yashowanta N. Mohapatra (Chair).",
      "For this article, we have mentioned a few impactful introductions, set out as recommendations or suggestions in the report, made by this committee with an aim to make PGP more student-friendly and meticulous, like most elite and recognized higher education programmes across the globe.",
      "Proposal to set-up PGFC",
      "A PG student typically comes from a different academic set-up and is often left bewildered by the organizational structure and flow of decisions and the stress of academic rigour. Discontent among students has been noted that has led to the propagation of a perception that the system is unresponsive towards problems of PG students. This shall become more acute as the Institute aims to considerably increase the size of PGP, which currently stands at approximately 40 per cent of the total strength.",
      "To resolve this issue, PGARC recommends setting up a Post-graduate Facilitation Centre (PGFC). The Centre shall be headed by an experienced faculty member or an eminent educationist and aided by a team consisting of one designated DPGC member from each Department and a PG representative of the Student’s Senate. The basic functions of PGFC will broadly include the following:",
      "i) Arranging professional support required by groups of students in improving language skills outside the formal course structure, communication skills in navigating careers, software and data analysis skills, and so on.",
      "ii) Coordinating outreach efforts of Departments to project PGP in digital media space (interviews with faculty and students, short films, etc.), social media, organizing events celebrating student experience through achievements in publishing papers, attending conferences, or innovative projects of a similar kind, maintaining helpdesks manned by students (as a part of their TA work) to direct students seeking help, and providing support to international students in consultation with International Relations Cell.",
      "Addressing Coursework Inadequacies",
      "It has been observed that Departments/IDPs are struggling to be able to offer enough courses to the satisfaction of students, especially for Master’s Programmes. Sometimes even compulsory courses are being joggled around in semesters due to the lack of a critical number of faculty in the Programme or Stream. This is a serious academic concern, and the need for interdisciplinary courses (compulsory or electives IDC/IDE) designed especially for PG students across Departments have been voiced. PGARC supports theintroduction of interdisciplinary courses. It encourages all Departments/IDPs to participate in at least one IDC annually, especially those that are offering different versions for similar content.",
      "A need for a Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies which spearheads the design and development of such courses is an issue that the Departments can discuss and then address accordingly. It has also been suggested to Departments that supervisors shouldallow students in engineering and science a course in HSSat an appropriate level as an AE if the candidate wishes so (keeping in view constraints of workload and progress). However, this course may be allowed only after the concerned student has passed the Comprehensive Examination successfully.",
      "With the fast-changing pace of knowledge boundaries, the doctoral programme, in which a student spends more than four years, must have the opportunity to continue formal learning even after all course requirements are over. Such opportunities can be made available to interested students through a 4-week long, 3-credit course capsule consisting of 12 lectures and 2 hours of testing or equivalent evaluation. TheSpecial Topic Course Capsule (STCC)can be offered by a visiting professor, a special invitee, or a faculty member.",
      "Further,recommendations to Senatefor considering adoption on the Institute level have been stated as well. These include:",
      "i) Introduction of a zero-credit PG Seminar Course (at least for one semester for M.Tech. and two semesters for PhD students) in which PG students attend seminars given by students under the mentorship of a faculty. This shall increase the breadth of knowledge and awareness of current trends in the discipline while improving communication skills.",
      "ii) The Department is advised to offer their doctoral students a course covering topical issues relevant to the profession and the disciplinary community, along with communication skills in writing and oral presentation. The communication skills module may be offered at the Institute level, and the introduction to profession module should be offered by the Department.",
      "Academic Performance: Inadequacy and Programme Termination Procedures",
      "The purely CPI-based criteria for identifying performance deficiency and termination has in large measure, resulted in structural ‘grade inflation’ across PGPs, instead of ensuring minimum quality standards in supposedly elite Programmes. In light of this, PGARC makes two recommendations:",
      "i) Introduction ofgranular grading: A+ (10/Outstanding); A (10/Excellent); B+ (09/B Plus); B (08/Good); C+ (07/C Plus); C (06/Fair); D+ (05/D Plus); D (04/Pass); E (02/Exposure); F (00/Fail); S: Satisfactory; X:Unsatisfactory; I: Incomplete (for internal usage before converting it to a valid letter grade on completion of evaluation components by the stipulated last date for submission of grades in a semester.(As per an email circulated before the beginning of the new semester, the granular grading system has been enforced on an institute level since 2022-23/I).",
      "ii) The currentminimum CPI criteria should be reduced to 6.5 for PhD Programmes, and 6.0 for Masters Programme. The revision of minimum CPI criteria should not be seen as a downgrading of standards but rather recalibration to protect the meaning of the standards the Institute seeks to adopt.",
      "Regarding the termination procedure, it has been recommended that the list of deficient students can be allowed to reply to a show-cause notice from the Convener, DPGC, after authorization from SPGC on the basis of the APEC report. SPGC be authorized to decide on a case-by-case basis considering the written and clearly argued recommendations of DPGC and Counselling Services. Only the Termination cases at that stage are brought to the Senate for consideration of mercy appeals.",
      "Milestones in Thesis Work",
      "PGARC makes the following set of recommendations to improve the quality ofPhD thesisand reduce the time taken to complete the degree:",
      "i)Open Seminar in 9th Semester(OS9S): this dictum or mantra should dictate all administrative policies, decision-making, and academic judgement at all levels. There are Departments in which currently the allotment of thesis supervisor is carried out after the Comprehensive Examination or the coursework is longer than three semesters. These Departments/IDPs need to critically review their doctoral programmes in the meantime so as to align with the policy of OS9S.",
      "ii) TheDoctoral Monitoring Committee(DMC) is now a mandated feature by the Senate. PGARC recommends that a DMC review meeting for a student need not be held at the end of the semester but at any time during it, with a constant gap between them in subsequent semesters. This would evenly distribute DMC meetings in a Department throughout the semester. The award of grades of thesis work remains the responsibility of the Thesis Supervisor as per the extant PG rules.",
      "iii) PGARC suggests that the Thesis Supervisor prepares the student forComprehensive ExamViva through several simulated sessions for them to understand the nature of the examination and expectations. Also, the Comprehensive Boards should provide a narrower pre-specified domain for preparation in view of the student’s coursework and foundations required for later work and career.",
      "iv) IntroducingThesis Work Plan: PGARC recommends that the student presents Version-1 of their broad work plan as a short document specifying the Thesis Work Plan (TWP) to the DMC within four months of finishing SOTA. The nature and style of the TWP is to be decided jointly by the Thesis Supervisor and the student. Keeping in view the work packages within the TWC, the period (between SOTA and Open) can be roughly divided into four achievement milestones (which can be changed as one progresses) which, when completed, will allow the student to deliver their Open Seminar.",
      "v) PGARC recommends that an online ‘PhD Student Status Dashboard’ be maintained for each student. This should contain essential information about PG Manual mandated milestones, due dates, completed dates, and achievements in Tabular form.",
      "vi)PhD exit options: M.Tech./MA/MS/MSR degree is proposed as the exit degree for PhD in all disciplines. A PhD student can opt for the exit option at any point of time in his/her PhD tenure after completing the required coursework. MTech/MA/MS/MSR thesis/project guide will be assigned by the DPGC Convener. A student failing in the comprehensive examination for two consecutive times may, on the recommendation of DPGC, shift to the exit track of the M.Tech./MA/MS/MSR programme. All PhD students in the exit track of a Master’s Programme be permitted, with the consent of the DPGC Convener, to participate in SPO placements any time after their fourth semester in the PhD programme.",
      "There is a need for stricter control at all stages of theMaster’s Thesis work,starting from articulating well-defined goals and the scope of the projects. Hence, PGARC makes the following suggestions and recommendations to the concerned departments:",
      "i) Prior to the supervisor assignment, projects with titles and a brief description of the scope must be floated on the basis of which students provide their options, or in other words, the students are assigned to projects floated. A certain fraction of students in each Department is allowed to opt for centrally floated projects by ambitious Institute level interdisciplinary research programmes.",
      "ii) The Master’s programme would improve if problems undertaken are shown to be directly related to the industry or are a part of industrial collaboration. In fact, for most such projects in the near future, the fellowship should or would be required to come from industry or be linked to the start-up ecosystem.",
      "iii) As an experimental measure, theBoard of Examiners for Master’s should, in its report, specify a quality tagsuch as Outstanding, Excellent, or Good with a brief justification. Only the Master thesis adjudged as outstanding or excellent can be nominated to the Awards Committee for consideration for any Institute-level award presented in Convocation.",
      "iv) If a student is not able to complete the requirements of a full thesis in the stipulated time as per the departmental norms, then the student can be offered an alternate degree, calledM.Tech. (with Project Report), as an exit option. The regular M.Tech. Degree certificate be referred to asM.Tech. (with Thesis). Delays in completion of M.Tech programme can be effectively controlled with this exit option.",
      "v) Currently, only 6% of the students in the MSR programme are sponsored by the projects, a serious anomaly for a programme explicitly targeted at project employees. To restore the original objectives of the programme, most of the students in this programme should be sponsored by projects or external organizations. To shift the intake of this programme in this direction, PGARC recommended that at least 50% of the seats filled in MSR admission in each department in a year must be against project funding. This percentage may be revised upwards by the Senate in 3-5 years to 75%.",
      "vi) PGARC recommends that the requirement of external review of the MSR thesis be removed, bringing its evaluation in line with current practice for M.Tech. thesis. This will improve the timeliness of thesis completion for such students, as well as avoid IPR conflicts that are very prevalent in more industry-centric research problems typically addressed by the project and externally funded MSR thesis.",
      "Tutorial and Teaching Assistantship",
      "PGARC recommends that the Departments should issue at the end of the doctoral programme atranscript-like(in a format uniform across all Departments)record of participation as Tutor, Teaching Assistant, or Academic Support(eg. website, library, help-desk services, etc.) listed under three different heads chronologically. The Department to which the student belongs should keep records for this purpose, possiblywith a quality tag of performance(such as Outstanding, Excellent, Good, etc) for internal usage. On the basis of the recommendation of a team of instructors,outstanding contributions to tutorial support or teaching assistantship can be recognized by a letter of appreciation from the HoD.",

On August 30, four weeks after their demands for re-employment were not met, the workers staged an indefinite dharna (here). Meanwhile, all has not been well with the retained workers either.",

The salaries for the month of August were paid by the contractor on 29 September, i.e. almost a month after August ended. Moreover, as of writing of this report on 30 October, they have not received wages for the month of September yet.",

      "It must be noted that most of these workers are sole earners in the family. During the year-long pandemic period, they were either unemployed or on meager salaries (due to less work days). Consequently, the pandemic not only depleted all their savings, but also put them deep in debt. Freshly out of the pandemic, a salary delay of nearly3 weekshas been catastrophic and has left them with no options but to take further loans to add to their debt.",

Similarly a Hall 13 mess worker told us that he received his salary on 22nd of a month (12 days delay from the allowed deadline of 10th day of the month). However, the delay in the water supply department has stretched for over three months and is one the worst delays in recent times.",

The Senior Engineer at IWD had then, informed them that the Deputy Director had assured employment for all of them in some other department of the Institute. Four weeks have passed since, and the workers have approached the office multiple times-but there appears to be no sign of relief.

Each of these pumps needs to be manually operated by a contract worker. In the absence of the worker, the machines are at risk of malfunctioning. Due to reduced strength under the new contract,the number of machines per worker would increase from 2-3 to 4-5.

      "On 12 June 2022,iitk.ac.in, the main website of our institute was hacked into. The words:  “ALL YOUR DATA HAS BEEN DELETED FROM YOUR SERVER” were flashed on the screen.",
      "Many people might consider this as just a wrinkle, but delving deeper into this, we came across a lot of questions. First, are other IITK websites vulnerable as well? Our campus is home to over ten thousand people and consequently, any vulnerability in such a huge network infrastructure that powers it, has significant consequences. Second, an enormous amount of personal data including our name, contact numbers, family income and address is stored on Institute websites like Pingala, OAG and HelloIITK. How safe is our personal data? Third, is the framework of our institute strong enough to protect us against malware and data leaks, and if not, what else can we do as users to protect ourselves?",
      "To answer these questions, we contacted a number of students who have exploited these vulnerabilities and professors responsible for handling cyber security issues. Here are our findings:",
      "According to Prof. Sandeep Shukla, many campus residents do not use any anti-virus software when connecting to the internet and hence, their computers remain susceptible to malware. We came across an incident where a Ph.D. student lost all her work because she was using pirated software without scanning it for viruses. We have also seen system attacks because the user clicked on seemingly harmless links. Ransomware attacks, (attacks in which an external body attacks websites,servers, desktops, laptops, or even mobile phonesand holds it hostage till a particular sum is paid as ransom), is another serious challenge for academic institutions. Years of cutting-edge research, stored on institute computers, can be taken hostage by such attacks. Unfortunately, IITK does not have a policy to deal with ransomware attacks.",
      "Moreover, IITK webmail only uses rule-based filtering to filter spam emails. The license for these rule-based filtering systems is bought by the Computer Center and contains institute-specific rules to filter out spam emails. However, such spam filters are much inferior to ML-based filtering algorithms used by commercial email providers like GMail. When asked why IITK cannot move to GMail or other commercial email providers for its email service, Prof. Manindra Agrawal said that all Government departments have been restricted from storing data on foreign servers.",
      "The onus, therefore, falls on the end user. Prof. Manindra Agarwal added, “it is absolutely important that everyone on campus is aware. People still keep falling for Nigerian princesses, which is surprising in a technological institute.”",
      "Our institute network consists of several web pages hosted by various professors, administration, research groups and students. Some of these websites are dynamic, whereas others have not been updated for a very long time.Dynamic websites offer more functionality but are also more vulnerable than static websites.Most institutions abroad have a template for web pages that can be hosted on their network, but IITK, like most Indian Institutes, does not have one.Prof. Sandeep Shukla stated that “the CC has always chosen functionality over security. This lack of a uniform website template makes the IITK network further susceptible.” Post the incident on 12 June (the hacking of the IITK website), the institute decided to allowweb sites and web applicationsto be ‘created only after approval from concerned authorities.’",
      "Prof. Sandeep Shukla told us that earlier Pingala gave the user unlimited attempts to guess the OTP when changing their password. Hence, a simple python script could be used to reset the password of any user.",
      "Not just Pingala, but OARS and HelloIITK are also plagued by several vulnerabilities. A student has demonstrated that it is possible to hack into a certain website and get access to the grades of any course, by running just a few commands. An alumnus told us that a glitch in HelloIITK allowed people to access the PDF of a question paperbeforeit was made publicly available by manipulating the URL. Fortunately, all of these loopholes have now been fixed and are stated here as an example. But several other vulnerabilities still remain open for attackers to exploit the IITK network.",
      "An alumnus who hacked into Pingala, stated that the administration, on his request, asked the people in charge of Pingala to take appropriate measures, but little has been done in that direction.",
      "All this leads one to wonder how secure all the data in the institute is. According to Prof. Sandeep Shukla, like most other institutes in the country, IITKdoes not have a data security policyto deal with cyber attacks.",
      "A committee was formed 6 months ago, when a fellow professor was able to hack into 2 administrators’ websites, stated Prof. Shukla. However, he added, that the committee has met only once since then, and thatsecurity is not being taken seriouslyin our institute.",
      "When asked if there is a need for data consent forms in the institute, Prof Manindra Agarwal stated that “consent is assumed to be implicit”. Some foreign institutes are known to have a consent policy in place, however in India, it is assumed to be implicit. The institute has no reason to sell your data to third parties, but with all the vulnerabilities which exist, this might be a good time to look at steps that are being taken to mitigate them.",
      "The C3i lab, headed by Prof. Sandeep Shukla and Prof. Manindra Agarwal, has framed data security frameworks for large organizations such as NHAI and helped them establish a data ownership/security policy.",
      "Prof. Manindra Agarwal stated that they plan to propose the usage of C3i systems for the institute cyber security. It is impossible to monitor all the accounts and emails and 1000s of data bits, and C3i would make life a lot easier for CC engineers.",
      "There are some personal responsibilities that should be taken care of by the student community and the faculty as well. This includes simple habits such as changing the passwords regularly, avoiding keeping common passwords for multiple sites, and avoiding writing passwords down, (rather, write hints for the passwords if you have a fear of forgetting the passwords).",
      "Prof. Sandeep Shukla also suggested that students should always log out of their accounts and remove the details on public devices. One should clear the cache and history if not working on their personal devices. He also suggested that people should not make monetary transactions on public wifi.",
      "In addition to this,Ashish Dutta, the current DDIA of IITK has been sending out emails to the students about how many students fall prey to bad internet practices and end up revealing their passwords to miscreants on the internet. These accounts end up being used to spam the institute. He also mentions preventive measures in his mail, such as changing your passwords and being wary of external links. It seems that there is still a lack of awareness among students about potential security threats on the internet.",
      "In conclusion, we believe that the institute must continue its efforts in creating a robust framework in which such security hazards are eliminated. At the same time, there is a need for users to be much more aware and careful about cyber-security hazards.",

      "Where does our campus get water from? Is the drinking water we get drinkable? What are the globally accepted standards of potable water? How should it taste?",
      "To seek answers to these questions, our team took readings from water samples around the campus, questioned the respective authorities, and looked into the flipside of the obvious RO solution. Here’s what we found out:",
      "Groundwater is the primary source of water on campus! The campus is equipped with ten bore wells, each of which is about 400 feet deep. Water pumped from these borewells is directly supplied to the halls by the IWD (Institute Works Department). The job of purification and installation of coolers falls under the purview of the respective Hall Executive Committee (HEC).",
      "",
      "The other potential source of water is the Kanpur Municipal Corporation, however, the municipal corporation has not been able to set up a stable water supply inside the campus yet, due to transportation issues. Another significant source of water for the campus is rainwater. A total of 20 buildings on campus are equipped with rainwater harvesting pits.",
      "",
      "To measure the standards of water supplied on the campus, our team went around the campus with a TDS meter and took readings from various water sources. But first, let us understand what TDS is.",
      "TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids – it is a measure of the concentration of the dissolved solids in mg/L (i.e. parts per million). These solids, ranging from minerals and metals to organic material and salts, account for the water’s quality, suitability for consumption, and perceived taste. Hence, we use TDS as a metric to determine if the water is fit for drinking, cooking, and other relevant purposes. However, our approach comes with two caveats.",
      "",
      "Firstly, TDS is only one of the many metrics used to judge the suitability of water. We can have a water sample with near optimum TDS levels, yet being unfit for drinking. This is because TDS is only a measure of the concentration of the dissolved salts, and does not tell us anything about which salts are actually dissolved.",
      "",
      "Secondly, taste is a subjective parameter and thereby, is somewhat unrelated to the TDS levels. However, it has been found that water with higher TDS levels seems to have a heavier “metallic” taste. On the contrary, lower TDS levels are linked with virtually no taste.",
      "Three benchmarks are majorly used to analyze water quality – the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards), WHO (World Health Organization), and Bisleri. The limits of acceptance vary only slightly between these three standards. These are the Bisleri standards:",
      "Our team took TDS readings from multiple water sources – both in residential halls and in public places like OAT and Academic Area. Multiple readings were taken from each source usingthisTDS meter, and the average of these readings has been used in the graphs below. Here are our findings:",
      "As we can see from the data, the water quality in most halls of residences remains unacceptable. The water sources in the Academic Area perform better than the halls. This is also in line withtheTDS level of water in Kanpur city, which is above 500.",
      "As per our study, RO seems to have improved the TDS readings of sources significantly.",
      "Recently, Hall 6 installed a second 500-centralized RO (costing about 4.2 lakh, including installation charges and regular servicing of the machine), in addition to one RO already purchased in January 2021. This brought sharp improvement in TDS readings in the hall, as compared to the readings we took before RO installation.",
      "Similarly, Hall 5, which is equipped with two centralized RO and another RO near the mess, displayed much lower TDS readings. This is in contrast with Hall 3, which has no centralized RO.",
      "However, in 2019,the Supreme Court upheld the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ban on RO water purifiers in areas with TDS levels less than 500. The following reasons were provided for the RO ban:",
      "",
      "Demineralization",
      "RO often deprives drinking water of essential salts that are naturally present in natural water and provide us with essential minerals. In our study, this was most prominently seen in the water of computer center RO, which gave an astonishing reading of just 6ppm.",
      "Water wastage",
      "For every one liter of potable water, RO water filters push out three to four liters of water, as per broad estimates. According to the Water Quality India Association, RO achieves 20-30 percent purified water and 70-80 percent is drained which is not disposed of properly. Some manufacturers, however, claim that their brands result in minimal reject water and up to 60 percent purified water.",
      "",
      "Hence, installing ROs to improve water quality needs to be looked at with a more nuanced lens. Improvement in water purity at the cost of questionable water quality and large water wastage needs to be studied in more detail.",
      "In response to the data obtained, our team talked to a few officials in the IWD office.We came to know that the IWD receives regular, often strongly worded complaints from students regarding the installation of RO purifiers in halls, and of how an RO purifier is akin to a “basic necessity”. This indeed seems to be the mainstream perception of ROs.",
      "The dysfunctionality of the Hall office, central stores, and DOSA offices during the covid pandemic stalled the completion of formalities for the purchase of ROs, leading to an extended period of dependence on mineral water and water from the mess, and few buildings in the academic area.",
      "In the last few years, the water quality has improved significantly as more and more residential blocks are getting RO purifiers. But is the RO solution sustainable? And if not, what lies ahead?",

      "“Youth are natural seekers of truth. Time to empower them with the needed clarity, commitment, and courage to find their truth” ~ Sadhguru",
      "Sadhguru, a bestselling author and mystic, recently embarked on a journey to meet citizens, leaders, and experts as a lone motorcyclist covering 30,000 km across 27 nations from the United Kingdom to India in 100 days for the “Save Soil” campaign.",
      "As a part of his journey, he visited the IIT Kanpur on June 8, 2022, marking the 80th day of the “Save Soil” campaign. Volunteers from the Isha foundation were present on campus days before the event. This event, titled the “Youth and Truth” campaign, was hosted by Students’ Gymkhana in association with Antaragni, IIT Kanpur.",
      "The event commenced with the songs of the “Save Soil” campaign by the Isha Foundation. To add more melody to the event, Chaand Baaliyan fame, Aditya Sirsa, mesmerized the audience with the Sounds of Isha.",
      "Isha Foundation presented multiple video clips to increase awareness about the “Save Soil” campaign explaining the importance and need of the movement. Following it, the Isha Samskriti group gave a surreal Bharatnatyam and Kalaripayattu performance.",
      "Theperformances were followed by a video highlighting the first 80 days of the campaign. Beginning in Europe, the campaign went through the Middle East, later coming to India, to be concluded in Coimbatore. During this journey, the “Save Soil” initiative was presented on April 5 at the United Nations in Geneva. It gathered support from WHO, the UN SDG lab (UN Sustainable Development Goals), and the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).",
      "Just after the video presentation, Sadhguru made a stage appearance joining the panel of students. The panel asked questions on diverse themes and evoked some unique and a few questionable insights from Sadhguru.",
      "",
      "Owing to the increasing relevance and awareness of mental health, Sadhguru was asked to give his views on why it is borderline offensive to suggest therapy to someone struggling with mental health issues. In response, he explained how the discourse around mental health is borrowed from the West and its understanding of psychology. He also mentioned the psychology of seeking attention and how human intelligence, as vital as it is, begins to work against us during mental illness.",
      "",
      "The discourse then explained why students at IIT (especially the freshers) feel like a misfit. Sadhguru talked about the huge competition to get into IIT and how the facilities provided here are better than in other places. He then established the importance of interest in the field one pursues rather than the social stature of being at IIT.",
      "",
      "In answer to his views on marijuana legalisation, Sadhguru dwelled upon the wastage of valuable time in intoxication. He talked about his beliefs that life’s purpose is to grow and develop, not fleeting away from reality. He also quoted a Telugu saying (to massive applause from the Telugu speaking audience).",
      "",
      "In response to a question asked from the perspective of an introverted student struggling to socialise, Sadhguru compares one’s nature to a mask one puts on oneself. He responded, “It should be malleable and not a rigid concrete wall. Suppose an introvert disposes of the perception that they are an introvert and goes on in life believing that they are comfortable in socialising and networking; gradually, that becomes a part of their personality.”",
      "",
      "He later addressed a question on the lack of emphasis on the aspect of compassion in movements of veganism and vegetarianism and over-emphasis solely on its health benefits. He stated how the quantity of meat consumed in the western lifestyle is way more than the amount typically consumed in Indian households. Thus it is logical in India for people to opt for vegetarianism on compassionate grounds rather than being motivated by its health benefits. Despite health-driven veganism movements failing to put forth a sympathetic stance in their campaigns, they ultimately succeed in attaining their purpose. Hence he believes lack of emphasis on compassionate grounds is not a big issue",
      "The panellists then opened the stage for the audience. A professor asked Sadhguru about the waning significance of the “guru-shishya parampara” in modern times. Sadhguru talked about the undue importance of information transfer in contemporary education and the increasing influence of technology in providing information, replacing human teachers.",
      "When asked by a first-year student about losing interest in spiritualism, Sadhguru mentioned how nature would prevent the discontinuation of such spiritual practices if it benefits humankind. This way, he tried motivating the student not to get ahead of himself in pursuing spiritual goals.",
      "After the panel and audience questions were over, a zealous devotee burst with emotions and conveyed her devotion to Sadhguru. With tears of happiness, she gifted Sadhguru a shawl which he accepted respectfully.",
      "",
      "Post the event, in interaction with the IITK Motor-Sports team, Sadhguru recalled how his motorbike often served as much more than just a vehicle.",
      "Later, the team showed their latest ATV “BAJA’20” mounter with “Save Soil” flags to Sadhguru. In their conversation with Sadhguru, the team explained that ATV possesses a lawn mower engine. Also, being lightweight, it doesn’t affect the soil culture as it moves on an uneven surface, thus in line with the save soil campaign. The team members and Sadhguru talked passionately about engines and how vehicles can be engineered to suit various needs. Sadhguru provided insights to the team for improving the efficiency of the vehicle and making it more environmentally friendly. The discussion ended on a high note, with Sadhguru giving the team a tour of his bike.",
      "From there on, Sadhguru took off on his bike to the next stop at Jhansi.",

      "A new academic year is here, leaving us with a list of things we would have done had the campus been open. A fitting tribute to the bygones would be to turn the lens on something that has been talked about more and more during these trying times. Through this piece, we review and analyse the incumbent sports culture to take a look at what the future holds for it in the institute and how the council has adapted to the new online regime.",
      "With a year and more of working from home, we have witnessed significant changes in the institute’s sports conditions. Though all sports events are virtual and lack the same vigour as that of an offline one, yet the situation is deemed to have its own upsides. The Games and Sports council has conducted a range of events throughout the span of time to keep the student community healthy and foster sports enthusiasm among all.",
      "The team is currently operating Fit India Freedom Run, a seven-week long initiative involving the institute coaches to guide and train students through multiple domains of fitness sports. The initiative to organize Ranbhoomi, an inter hall tournament for the UG and PG freshers, covering competitive events of a majority of sports, provided a platform for students to showcase skills and embark on to be a part of the teams. The Adventure Club recently hosted the Never Ending Adventure 2.0 training workshop consisting of live workout, boxing and yoga sessions. The council also conducted live Zumba sessions spread over two weeks for fun-laden fitness interactions. Besides, a number of events and talks were organized to accentuate both mental and physical fitness strategies as a part of the Win India campaign.",
      "As a current point of concern, in order to revive the intensity of training after returning to campus, it is important that the council starts reaching out to new prospective students now. Anshika Chaudhary, the current General Secretary of the Games and Sports council, in this regard, remarks,",
      "“We are trying to ensure a basic level of fitness for the new members by practising in-home exercises so that they don’t have to spend most of their time regaining their fitness and rather work on improving their skills. Also, people are now consciously making time to take care of their bodies and mind and stay healthy.”",
      "The biggest takeaway from the pandemic has been the increasing awareness about the importance of health and fitness. Like they say, it is darkest before dawn, the increased concern will spill over to the offline shift and people will engage more consciously in physical activity through games and sports on campus. It has also led to an explosive interest in e-gaming among the students as they find this to be one of the few fun and social activities that they can engage in with friends.",
      "The council is now taking measures to help the people with their physical and mental fitness during the pandemic. Talks on mental health, yoga, meditation activities along with live online workout sessions are aiding the interested people in upping their health game. When enquired about the possible gap in the continuity of the sports performance among the teams, we receive,",
      "“The passing out of the most experienced players will indeed have an effect on the teams, but this gap will prevail among all IITs. Given the fierce competition, it is imperative to connect with the new batches as they will comprise the majority of the team members. There will be a step-by-step process to welcome new students. A camp will be conducted for the upcoming batch students after they reach campus to initiate them into the practice and training sessions of the different teams, clubs and societies.”",
      "The council currently upholds regular interactions and competitions to keep the members motivated and preserve their pride and identity in their activity. Teams are having farewells, meetings and virtual workout sessions, however, the council does acknowledge the difficulty in operation. Regarding the new challenges faced online, this stands as the right time to get new ideas and approaches to try out things. The team is parallelly working to encourage sports startups and technology to make students cognizant of such career opportunities, given that they are gaining traction in India. The current team is now also focussing on making the council structure more inclusive to bring increased involvement of PGs and women representatives.",
      "In conversation with the Ex-General Secretary, Soumarup Bhattacharyya, we delved into the uncertainty the council faced after the lockdown. Although the break was inevitable, the team started organising esports tournaments to revive the activities, which received a huge response and eventually resulted in an esports society today. It was one of the positives of lockdown and the first time an initiative involving more than 100 applicants for society leaders and secretaries was instigated, with Deepak Kumar, the former Associate Head Teams, playing a huge role in promoting and popularizing it to varied grounds. But keeping in mind the possible repercussions, the number of tournaments was restricted to 1 per E-game so that any addiction isn’t encouraged. They then focussed on updating all social media accounts to also recognize the Inter-IIT players through these public platforms. The website was revamped and infrastructural upgrades were done when the postgraduates were on the campus. The council helped rebuild the gym with new equipment using a budget of 12 lakhs as funded by DORA.In this regard, he also commends the efforts and initiatives of the past General Secretary, Jaspreet Singh, and the then Associate Head, Neelakshi Shaku, for building up a strong foundation of the council. As a message to the aspiring sportspersons on campus, he adds,",
      "“I will ask the people to remain focussed in their academics, ensure physical and mental wellness, and not get swayed by their emotions and anxiety. Participate in all the fitness events and competitions conducted by the council. Stay informed about the activities of the council by inquiring regularly and staying connected.”",
      "For Institute Teams, a whole different story emerges. Usually, an average team player has four years to develop his skill, each stage being crucial in the long run. In the first year, one gets into the rhythm of the sport after being out of touch for so long or tries his hand on a new one. The second year is when the athlete requires maximal input and effort. According to the general trend, players reach their peak in their second and third campus year and their skills fairly improve in the final years. However, this schema is disturbed now and it would require an enormous will to revive. The council has thus decided to organise regular conditioning sessions and drills along with workshops and talks to help the team members maintain their fitness and be match ready. These sessions will be open to all, thus providing aspiring candidates an overview of the functioning of the institute teams.",
      "The Associate Head of Institute Teams, Ankul Kumar, stressed the importance of recruiting new players given the current requirement of filling in the vacancies of those passing out. But the recruitment process is strenuous in the online mode, as it is difficult to judge a player’s grasp over a particular sport without physical interaction. He commented that the pandemic has adversely affected the collective culture and rendered an added responsibility on the council and coaches to acquaint the new students with the culture and practices of each team. However, the remote working has made it easier to reach out to alumniwho otherwise had to explicitly spare time to come to campus and talk to the students. After curating the necessary database, the council is planning to facilitate student-alumni interaction to pass on the sports know-how and legacy to prospective future players.",
      "Clubs and Societies make up an integral part of the GnS council. Most of the clubs require a physical presence on the campus to operate appropriately and their functioning has been adversely affected by the pandemic. On this concern, Shambhavi Dube, Associate Head Clubs and Societies, states that they are holding regular meetings to address the administrative issues. Besides, the focus also revolves around spreading awareness and apprising the students of the plethora of clubs and societies they can explore. In conversation with Shubham Gupta, Associate Head Events, we were informed that the team is trying to arrange various kinds of events besides the online sports activities. Some of these will even focus on the player’s fitness regime highlighting its significance and implementing it remotely.",
      "It is true that the pandemic has had adverse implications on the working of the council, however, best efforts are made to give way to an efficient sports culture in the institute. When it comes to games and sports, it is important that we keep going and continuing without a stop. The team bears the hope that campus reopening will stage the resumption of activities and events and infuse sports enthusiasm back again to revive the celebrated sports culture of IITK. This prospect provides the spectrum of a healthy lifestyle with physical and mental well being, today and beyond.",

      "As another online semester reaches its mid-way, the lack of access to the Internet and consistent electricity supply has come across as a major bottleneck for the resource-constrained students. Vox Populi talked to resource-constrained undergraduate students across different batches to learn about the challenges they face during the online semesters and the assistance, if any, they have received from the administration.  The stories were narrated to Vox correspondents over phone calls and have been presented as-is. All names have been used with the consent of the concerned students.",
      "Chandra Shekhar(Y19, CE)",
      "I come from Jehanabad, Bihar. In the online semesters, I broadly face three problems: one, I have a very slow internet; two, the electricity supply here is very erroneous and goes off often; and three, my daily expenses in college were reimbursed by an external scholarship I had managed to get. But now at home, since I cannot provide the bills (like mess bills for food), I am unable to avail the scholarship and that has financially affected my family.",
      "Due to frequent blackouts in my area, I nearly missed interviews I was shortlisted for, in the internship season this year. In fact, to give Citi Corp’s interview, I had to go to a friend’s house, which had an inverter.",
      "The response of professors to my problems have been varied, differing from professor to professor. Unfortunately, there is no uniform policy, which the college administration follows about these problems. But most of the professors do not accept email submissions, saying that it isn’t their problem and defer the responsibility to the DoAA. This creates huge trouble for me.",
      "I feel like people who have contacts and more friends are able to perform better during the online semesters. I have very few social contacts and hence, I think I suffer academically due to high averages.",
      "Yes! If I am called back to the campus, most of my problems- electricity supply, slow internet and scholarship- would be solved!",
      "Pratap Singh(Y19, CHE)",
      "I reside in a village in Rajasthan. The internet speed I get here is 0.3 kbps! To put this in perspective, I need to walk 1 kilometre from my village to send a Whatsapp message!",
      "The previous president (Nikunj) had helped me a lot. I used to get offline material in pen drives and my quizzes used to happen over email. However, in the next semester, when the president changed, all of this stopped!(He said he hasn’t contacted the current president with his issues yet).",
      "In addition to the Internet issues, my family’s financial conditions are very poor. Also, I live in a joint family, so my house does not have a proper environment to study. Therefore, I rented a room in the city, where I could get better internet. I stayed there for 3 months, during which time my academic performance significantly improved.",
      "But since we couldn’t afford the room any longer, I have come back now! Due to poor internet access, I cannot watch lectures and have to make do with the downloaded slides.",
      "I also couldn’t prepare for the internship season because all resources were online and thereby, inaccessible to me. Moreover, I couldn’t seek help from friends, since I have lost contact with most of them during the online semester.",
      "Some professors have helped me a lot like Prof. Pankaj Apte had waived some of my quizzes where I faced internet problems. However, some professors are ‘cruel’- they do not allow students in the class after the first 5 minutes and so, I am often left in the waiting room!",
      "I had emailed the DoAA a lot of times about my problems, but have received no reply. The only help I have received was from the previous president.",
      "I believe that I can do much better academically if I get access to better internet. I am doubly vaccinated now and hence, request the administration to call me back to the campus as soon as possible!",
      "<Name Retracted>(Y18, MSE)",
      "I come from a village in Rajasthan and here, we have pathetic internet speed!",
      "With 3 labs every week of 3 hours each, I face a lot of problems due to my internet. Moreover, exams which have proctoring over Zoom or which require submission of large files are very troublesome for me. The other issue is that I live in a house with 24 members – hence, the environment is not exactly conducive for my academic pursuits.",
      "I am very concerned about the upcoming placements because firstly, I am unable to access online resources, thanks to my internet problems. And secondly, I cannot attend long Zoom interviews as my internet gives up after some time!",
      "I have emailed the DoAA and the DoSA multiple times but haven’t received any help from them! The only help I have received is that some professors have given me 10-20 extra minutes for submission, but that was also not allowed by all professors.",
      "<Name Retracted> (Y20,CE)",
      "In my district, there is only one network provider, who provides decent connectivity. However, the tariff plans are substantially expensive. With ‘camera on’ policies being adopted in some of my courses, if we have a couple of classes and an exam on the same day, then rationing of the internet plan becomes a major hassle. In case of a disruption, my instructors have most often not paid any heed to submissions via emails and appeals through forums have not garnered any response.",
      "Additionally, I come from a Hindi-medium school. Although I attended remedial classes, I find it hard to grasp lecture content. In fact, one of my professors also ridiculed Hindi-medium students in a class and called them ‘backward’.",
      "I tried reaching out to the Counselling Service and the Hall Office for help, but I did not receive any concrete response to my concerns and the network connectivity issues still persist.",
      "I think it would be very helpful if the institute provides some financial aid to students facing such issues in the online semester so that we can at least make a substantial effort to catch up with our peers in academics.",
      "Jitesh Sethi(Y20, CHM)",
      "I live in a town in Nagaland and face frequent power cuts. Even today, we didn’t have power for the entire day. In fact, I don’t own a laptop, which means that I have to attend all my classes and appear for my exams with the help of my phone. This is a major bottleneck for me because I faced issues in my first year where I was only able to submit 3-4 pages of my 16-page long answer scripts.",
      "Moreover, I live in a joint family and I don’t have a personal room for attending classes and appearing for exams. There are always people present since we don’t have separate rooms for everyone.",
      "With sporadic internet connectivity and limited facilities, the online semester is tough to keep up with. I had emailed professors in my first year about my concerns but I didn’t get any reply. This semester, I brought my problem up with a professor in class, however, I was told that it wasn’t his domain to act on it and that there was little he could do. There isn’t any formal mechanism in place to ask for any aid in this matter!",
      "Campus reopening would definitely solve most of my problems since a little personal space, ample internet connectivity and appearing for exams would be comparatively very easy than what it is now.",
      "Bhawani Shankar(Y20, ME)",
      "I live in a home with only one room, meaning that some of my family members are often present while I have to take exams or attend classes. Since my home is also near the highway, it becomes quite cumbersome to attend lectures without disturbance. Screen times have increased drastically in the online semester, and health-related concerns like body aches, the strain on the eyes and ears and improper sleep too have affected my academic performance to a significant extent.",
      "The network connectivity issue is very real. I’ve faced disruptions in connectivity during lectures and the problem during exams has led to me losing a lot of marks in the first couple of semesters. I tried to reach out to professors regarding the network connectivity concerns, however, I’ve either not received any reply or have been told that it is my problem to deal with.",
      "With the lab courses this semester, a number of us living in rural cities face a problem since we need to go to the city, which is about 20km from my place, to get the necessary apparatus to complete the experiment. This frequent travel and the unavailability of certain materials in my locality means that I’ve to spend added time and money to be prepared for the coursework. I also know of certain friends who are not able to afford expensive laptops and are facing issues running heavy softwares like AutoDesk Fusion 360, which are mandatory for coursework in my department.",
      "Reopening of campus would mean that several of these problems are solved for resource-constrained students. It’d also help to reduce academic stress on students. Any aid from the administration and the faculty would really help us, students, to make the most out of the coursework we have.",
      "Our opinion",
      "While we could cover only so many students, these problems plague a much larger section of the student community. The online semesters have led to increased inequity, as we all do not have access to the same resources. We believe that calling back resource-constrained students would solve most of these problems, and this should have been prioritised long before. It is welcome to hear from the DoSA (in his email dated 6 September) that discussions to call back resource-constrained students have begun but it remains to be seen when the actual plan materialises.",

    "content": [
      "In July ‘21, our team conducted an anonymous survey (forwarded on the students’ list) to dive deep into the issue of cheating and plagiarism in exams. The survey received 629 responses, with about 40% Y20 respondents, 21% Y19 respondents and 15% Y18 respondents, among others. To present a balanced perspective on the issue, we talked to 9 professors about cheating, their views and policies. Here are the findings from the survey and our conversations with professors-",
      "The survey results say it loud and clear- most respondents have been involved in one or the other form of cheating! However, the means and motivation behind cheating varied. Most respondents claimed that they cheat only in specific courses that they find difficult or uninteresting.",
      "Moreover, according to our survey, cheating is relatively less prevalent among postgraduate and PhD students than undergraduate students. Moreover, while postgraduate students mostly seem to cheat in assignments and projects, UG students cheat primarily in semester exams and minor exams(such as quizzes).",
      "We also asked our respondents about the method of cheating. We find that among those involved in cheating, 80% of respondents discuss with friends, 70% refer to notes or slides of the course during a closed book exam and 55% refer to online resources.",
      "Interestingly, we also found that of the 33 TAs/tutors who responded to our survey, about 20% of them said that they have unfairly helped the students they tutor at least once.",
      "When we asked our respondents about their motivation to cheat, a massive 54.4% respondents said that they cheat because they fear being left behind due to relative grading, since a large number of their classmates are cheating as well. Other popular motivations were to get a better CPI and the lack of utility of the course in their career goals. A noteworthy 19.4% respondents said that they cheat because other obligations and circumstances have made it difficult to focus on academics. The response patterns remained similar across batches, except that a significant share of UG Y20 respondents cheated because they aspired to change their branch.",
      "When asked if they feel guilty about cheating, the response was rather distributed! While about a quarter of the respondents felt guilty but couldn’t let go of cheating as a habit, about 20% found cheating acceptable in the given circumstances. Another 13% said they did feel guilty, but they found the course content irrelevant anyway.",
      "On the other hand, when asked if our respondents would report cheating, the responses were highly skewed! 60% respondents said they’d not report any instance of cheating, while about 19% said they’d report it only if it is a major violation. Similar but less skewed trends were seen among TAs and tutors; About 30% respondent TAs said they did not report cheating instances despite spotting students.",
      "Nearly all the professors who talked to Vox said that the root cause of cheating is our education system, which gives little incentive on learning but more on grades. “We are so grade-centric that learning has gone out of focus. If learning was my main motive, why would I cheat?” said Professor Harshvardhan Wanare from the Physics Department.",
      "“Failure is not perceived as normal in our world, while success is. If success is the goal, the shortest route is bound to attract some. So, one should not be surprised if some people found that opportunity in the online Semester,” said Prof. Achla Raina, the Dean of Academic Affairs.",
      "Professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay called cheating an ‘act of desperation’, which has only ‘normalised to the extent that it does not induce guilt.’ Prof. Harshavardhan and Prof. YN Mohapatra went on to call cheating an ‘Asian Problem’ (too few opportunities and too many people). Prof. YN Mohapatra also mentioned that the greed for opportunities and the premonition that “everyone else is cheating” further incentivised cheating.",
      "Our survey asked students to identify the measures they think were most effective against cheating. The most popular options were having group assignments and exams, open-book/ open-internet tests and making course lectures more interesting- each of these was chosen by more than half of our respondents. Other popular options were: continuous assessment policies, lenient grading policies and increased interaction with tutors and instructors.",
      "Interestingly, only 19% of respondents think that strict proctoring and invigilation is effective against cheating! Also, a fifth of our respondents took the view that no measures can reduce cheating. Other subjective suggestions included taking oral viva exams, avoiding objective questions and making classes more interactive.",
      "Four professors who talked to Vox (Prof. Amitabha Bandopadhyay, Prof. Jonaki Sen, Prof. Harshwardhan Wanare and Prof. Dheeraj Sanghi) said that, if the class size allows, they’d prefer evaluating students based on vivas and post-lab interviews to gauge clarity in the subject.",
      "Prof. Nisheeth said that he never had weightage for attendance in his offline classes but had tweaked the policy during the online semester. He said, “During the online sem, some people attend classes from villages, with poor internet connection. I, in the comforts of city life, can not comment on their situation. Hence, I tweaked my policy here. The least I can expect from the students is that they attend the lectures. Over my blabbering voice, there is bound to be something that they understand, even if they listen distractedly. “",
      "He also argues for a much liberal policy for specialised courses, but not for an IC course. ”While taking the ESC101 course last year, which recruiters look upon as a measure of the basic coding knowledge, I didn’t promote collaboration among students. However, for specialised courses, which are taken up by students who are interested in learning the course content and are not directly relevant to recruiters, I’ve permitted collaboration among students. In this way, the students will have to study something and contribute in a group,” said Prof. Nisheeth.",
      "Prof.Dheeraj Sanghi also suggested offline regional exam centres for better-proctoring facilities.",
      "When we asked non-Y20 respondents if they cheated to the same extent in the offline semester, only 3.1% respondents said they cheated as much as they do now! More than two-thirds of the respondents had never cheated in an offline semester.",
      "Additionally, we asked students from all batches if they would cheat when we go back to the offline semester. To this, a massive 65% respondents said they wouldn’t cheat at all, and an additional 23% said they wouldn’t cheat unless in a desperate situation like failing. The response distribution was similar for both Y20 and non-Y20 batches.",
      "Most professors believe that plagiarism and cheating have become much more widespread in the online semesters not because the mentality to cheat has changed but because it is easier to cheat now.",
      "“In an online semester, things might have been lax, and thus it has been easier to cheat. In offline mode, we have an army of invigilators, and we take strict measures against it,” said Prof Bandyopadhyay.",
      "Professor Braj Bhushan told Vox that plagiarism had survived through different modes, whether offline or online. “Those who are not able to exhibit better self-control are likely to repeat these actions irrespective of whether one is handling the situation online or offline,” he added. Professor YN Mohapatra voiced similar sentiments, “Most of the students are sitting on the fence. Their decision to cheat or not is determined by their friends and how strict the rules are.”",
      "Several professors connected the psychology of cheating with what is at stake. Professor Harshwardhan Wanare explained with an example, “the thing at stake when you do something wrong on foreign soil is your Visa, and no one wants to hamper their career prospects for a few marks. Thus the same student when they go to a different nation, we see a different being. A much better version of them.”",
      "Prof. Bandhyopadhyay raised concerns, in particular about the freshmen who have not had an offline semester ever-  “Your understanding and analytical growth will be stunted. You will not be as efficient as your seniors in the offline semester. Again, the shift from online to offline will negatively impact anyone who hasn’t taken academics seriously.”",
      "Prof. Achla Raina, the Dean of Academic Affairs, talked about the silver lining, “in the online semester, we have experimented with novel means of evaluation and assessment, some of which have worked extremely well. You will see many of these continue in the offline semesters!”",
      "Prof Nisheeth compares the mindset of IITs to that of the prison system, in contrast to that of an army camp. He says, “there are instances where the students themselves complain about the incidents of cheating and are disturbed that it is happening, but at the same time do not wish to name the students involved. It is like a prison system! The prisoners complain about their problems to the jailer, but they do not want to take up the responsibility to make those changes. They leave it up to the jailers, the administration in this case, to make changes. This is in contrast to an army camp, where a soldier not performing up to the mark is seen as the failure of the entire contingent. So the soldiers take it up to them to help their fellow mates perform well and train harder. ”",
      "Meanwhile, Prof Harshawardhan offers a Panchatantra analogy, “the problem with our educational system is that we seek assessment before understanding. Before a firm grasp of knowledge is established, we uproot the plant to gauge and evaluate its progress, forgetting that doing so inhibits the very growth we desire. There are, presently, more exams than learning goals. Exams are not part of learning, and we need to understand that.”",
      "He goes on to assert, “as a system, we professors are equally responsible. But sanctioning collective cheating in the garb of the pandemic? No, I can not accept that. In fact, this is the peer talk which everyone should be having.”",
      "Prof. Amitabha Bandhopadhyay and Prof. Jonaki Sen asked students to ‘learn the subject for their own good.’ Prof YN Mohapatra goes on to add, “the value of inner life is not understood in this age. Finally, the joy of having done a job well comes not just from being good at it but also from having done it honestly!”",
      "When asked if she had a message for the students, the Dean of Academic Affairs, Prof. Achla Raina said, “Don’t do anything that you might be ashamed of later!”",

      "On 22nd January, the first shot of the Covid vaccine was delivered to the health workers of our Institute. Of course, we all got excited and decided to bring to you what’s been happening under the hood and how this came to be. We had a talk with the Head of HC, Dr. Mamta Vyas, to find out all about this great news. Here’s everything we got to know.",
      "So, the government has planned to carry out the vaccination drive in multiple phases. The first phase includes immunizing all the health care workers who are at the greatest risk. Phase 2 includes all the other frontline workers such as police personnel, army personnel, and sanitation workers. After that, we have phase 3 that includes the people over 50 years old and all the other people with comorbidity(multiple diseases) such as those suffering from hypertension and diabetes.",
      "We, the HC and IITK administration have been very proactive to get this done smoothly. HC had prepared the list of health workers to be vaccinated and got almost all of them vaccinated. Of the 92 workers on that list, 90 have been vaccinated, and only 2 are left, both of whom have certain medical issues. HC workers will receive the second dose of vaccines on 19th February which will complete their immunization.",
      "Initially, HC was not one of the designated vaccination centres designated by the government. But considering the number of health care workers involved, we asked the COVID Vaccination Officer of Kanpur to carry out the vaccination drive in HC itself. Upon our insistence, the CMO of Kanpur, DM of Kanpur, and the COVIDVaccination Team of the district declared HC as a COVIDVaccination Centre. Finally, on 22nd January, our Director, the DM, and the CMO of Kanpur inaugurated this drive.",
      "The government has provided guidelines to be followed at any vaccinating centre, like having a waiting area with social distancing norms, a vaccination chamber, an observation area, and an AEFI (Adverse effect following immunization) room. AEFI room is like an emergency room ready to deal with cases of potential side effects after vaccination. All of these guidelines were followed at HC. Chairs were put up in the pharmacy lounge, and that area was used as the observation zone. The emergency room (room #7) was used as the AEFI room. The Vaccination team authorized by the government was present throughout the process which consisted of 14 people and a few police personnel. People from this team alone were allowed to carry out the vaccination and they were very efficient in their roles.",
      "Two vaccines are currently authorized by the government – Covaxin, and Covishield. HC workers were vaccinated with Covishield. The government provided the vaccine and we did not really have a choice among the two. Two doses of the vaccine are required to complete the immunization, with the second dose being 28 days after the first one. After 14-28 days of the second dose, antibodies develop in the body. Even after being vaccinated, people should continue exercising caution and use masks, wash hands frequently, and follow social distancing norms.",
      "At HC, the vaccinated people were given a rest for  30 mins during which they were kept under observation by the AEFI and vaccinating teams. Fortunately, no one suffered from any significant side effects. OPD services were closed for that day while emergency services remained active. Few of us faced some mild body aches, mild fever, and some pain at the injection spot, after several hours. All the health workers were back to their normal duties the very next day.",
      "For the second and third phases, we are requesting the authorities to let HC be a vaccination center to help vaccinate the campus residents.",
      "Vaccination for everyone is yet to be announced. Anyone should be able to get themselves vaccinated in the later phases. Once vaccination for everyone is announced, the institute will plan it through HC.",
      "We strongly urge people to keep faith in our scientists and the vaccines being made. We also request every health worker out there to come forward and get vaccinated. I, myself have received my first shot along with my co-workers and would urge people to come forward for vaccination on their turn. We are happy that we did not face any issue in getting our health workers vaccinated, unlike other centres, where several medical workers were hesitant and some even had to be chased down to get vaccinated! Our 90 health workers were vaccinated only in about two and a half hours with no such complications.",
      "We believe that the entire community must look forward to vaccination so that we can get back to normalcy as soon as possible. The Health Centre has been functioning continuously throughout the pandemic despite all the odds. As a doctor, it’s a real struggle to treat patients, with all these restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Quite a few of our employees did get infected by COVID, which caused considerable anxiety and fear initially, but they duly recovered and got back to their duties. Becoming immunized has given us a lot of confidence going forward and would help the community in quickly getting back to normalcy.",

      "Distant is the day we got a mail announcing that our Holi break is extended for 12 days. Many of us were delighted, and there was news that some hailed corona as a savior, chanting slogans like “Jai corona, jai corona!”",
      "No one’s doing that now.",
      "This virus took our exciting, productive, and fun-filled campus lives and turned it into a boring, bland slog of a semester. We should’ve been out there, learning and developing our lives. Handling another such semester without our friends, wingies, and MT ke chai-pakode would not be very pleasant, will it?",
      "Let’s have a look at what’s happening in our college and around the world. We’ve done some digging and a lot of speculation to get a hint of what the future holds for us. We’ve looked into how different universities around the world are coping up and adjusting their curriculums to find a place for the real experience.",
      "Conversation with the DoAA",
      "Our conversation with our Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor Achla M Raina revealed that going online was not a matter of choice for the administration; it was the only recourse the Institute had, given the COVID-19 outbreak.",
      "Having a normal semester was never a viable option because of the risks involved. Hence, we had to turn to the online mode of instruction. On the subject of assessment, a model to have an offline mid-term and end-term assessment was considered at one stage. However, since calling students from all over India for exams was again a huge gamble, outsourcing the exam was also considered. Technically a mode of exams where we could choose to give exams to a center close to our homes could also have been viable, just like it happens for JEE. In this case, however, students living in poorly connected areas would have had to travel a lot for the exams and the logistics of doing it for each of the over 500 courses would have been a nightmare.",
      "Eventually, it was decided to have a continuous assessment scheme, so that each assessment holds comparatively less weightage and assesses a relatively smaller portion of the syllabus. This would also discourage students who were not keeping up with the Honor Code.",
      "Another significant factor that went into this decision is the need for closure of a semester. Keeping the assessment hanging in uncertain times as these only makes things even more uncertain. This was one of the reasons the Re-examination for 2019-20-II Semester was chosen to be conducted in the middle of this semester itself, even though it had its drawbacks.",
      "Around 40 faculty members were working to get the course materials delivered in pen drives to students who had serious problems with internet connectivity. These companions of ours are at a major disadvantage and it’s great our college is doing what it can, for them.",
      "We need to recognize that we don’t have any good choices left. All the good choices have been laid to rest by the evolving global health crisis and we are presented with a scant amount of sub-optimal solutions. And we have to, regrettably choose one of these.",
      "The Students’ Take",
      "The current semester went by quite quickly due to its condensed nature but was way more challenging for most than an offline semester.",
      "Through the initial weeks of the semester, many such out-of-the-box policies (read: experiments) passed, and many failed too, which burdened the further course of many students’ academic load. Problems faced by professors were resolved as the semester progressed. Some professors have even come up with innovative ideas for teaching and assessment.",
      "The new batch, Y20, has joined in online mode. It is the same for them as it was in JEE days, sitting at home and studying. Till now, it’s been challenging for the Y20 batch, since they have to adjust to new ways of teaching and assessments without the help that comes with the presence of friends.",
      "We all remember the orientation period with the initial nervousness and adrenaline rush, right? For them, the orientation was attending webinars for two straight days.",
      "Conversation with a Residing Student",
      "In a recent conversation with a Ph. D student currently on campus, he informed us that about 900 students opted to return when first asked by the administration. Further, the departments were asked to give a preference list for arrival, as the students would be returning in batches. This list was loosely based on seniority. On arrival, there were some checks at the institute gate, and the students had to fill a form declaring they will take necessary precautions. Regulations are being followed by the campus community and regular temperature checks are being held.",
      "According to him, professors are very eager for the students to return to labs, although classes are to be delivered online only. The Ph.D. curriculum has been tweaked to accommodate WFH, especially the literature bit. Overall, the students back on campus seemed to be satisfied with the institute’s efforts.",
      "In our conversation with Vedaant Sikka, the present Convener of CoSHA (Council of Students’ Hostel Affairs) gave us insights as to how PG students have been residing on the campus. Students were called in batch sizes of around 250 and were quarantined for 14 days. Each wing had only a few rooms occupied which ensured social distancing. Food was delivered to each room by mess workers wearing a protective kit.",
      "Coming to the campus was completely voluntary and the decision for which students to call and in what order, was handed to the departments who’d know it best.",
      "For PGs doing experimental work, there was no way to do that from home. As for UGs, they can study online, however unrewarding or frustrating it may be. So it does make sense to start calling PGs first.",
      "As for the prospects of UGs returning to campus, they look bleak, unfortunately. The academic calendar for next semester does not specify directly that the exams will be online though. The institute is keeping options open for now.",
      "Challenges with calling students back",
      "Our conversation with Nikunj Kothari, President of Students’ Gymkhana revealed the main issues that came up in the discussion of calling back students.",
      "Initially, testing was not possible, so the only way to call any student was that we had to quarantine people and wait for the symptoms. This also limits the number of students we could call in a single batch since quarantine space is limited. This is what we had to do when we started calling PG students.",
      "Another problem is that our college, and Kanpur as a city, are not very well equipped to deal with covid cases. There are around 3 hospitals in the entire city that are equipped to deal with COVID cases since things can get out of hand pretty quickly. Even the few people on campus who had COVID had difficulty finding a bed in these hospitals.",
      "Also, the institute needs to be meticulous and careful regarding the wellbeing of its students. If it doesn’t seem feasible to safely call back students, the institute will have to continue in the online mode. IITM had an outbreak and they had trouble getting it under control with such great medical infrastructure. In Kanpur, it’ll be way more problematic.",
      "Logistically as well, the college isn’t equipped to handle so many students with social distancing in place.",
      "So things do look bleak for the time being. Let’s look at a few ideas and potential solutions to some of the problems.",
      "Any Solutions?",
      "With the above problems in place, implementing a robust and systematic plan to bring students back is hard. Universities around the world have tried to execute this and have failed miserably sometimes, while some have carried out the process with certain poise. Some things that can be learned from their mistakes and from their plans are here:",
      "So you see, nothing very new. But we wish it were feasible to implement. The honest truth about reopening the campus is that while the situation can be made safer or riskier, but there is always going to be a fuzzy demarcating line between the two.",
      "Julia Marcus, an infectious disease expert recently explained in an interview:",
      "“Any plan that requires a radical change in behaviours and perfect compliance is doomed to fail.”",
      "Who’d have thought we would be gone for 10 months as we left this place for our homes back in March. But here we are, sitting in our homes, sometimes working, sometimes not, with the only social interaction being with our families and via call or text to our friends. No bicycle hitchhiking to classes, no friends to wake us up and drag us to classes, no wing hangouts, and no late-night campus walks. Our rooms gather dust, and so do we. We were supposed to still explore the campus and the people there, work in the clubs, and live out the fests again. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. But asLemony Snicketwrote,",
      "“Fate is like a strange, unpopular restaurant filled with odd little waiters who bring you things you never asked for and don’t always like.”",
      "And so here we are, trying to make something with this time handed to us. Trying to stay in touch with our friends (not to mention our classes!). Wishing that the real campus experience starts sometime soon, and now we’ll appreciate it much more. That is, of course, if we are lucky to have it.",

    "title": "The NIRF Discussion: Erroneous data and unfairness of parameters",

      "On 29th September 2015, the MHRD announced its decision to come up with a National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), “outlining a methodology to rank institutions across the country.” Every year since then, the MHRD has released these rankings, which are calculated using a set of metrics that have been amended throughout the years. The latest annual ranking exercise NIRF has shown a few consistent performers in the Engineering Category with IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, and IIT Bombay sharing the top three positions for the third consecutive year, while IIT Kanpur moved up a spot to fourth.",
      "The MHRD claims that the NIRF score is meant to be “a reflection of where the institution is standing vis-a-vis other institutions in the same category.” But are these scores a fair assessment of an Institute’s overall performance? How reliable are these rankings? We try to answer these questions by considering two different, but equally important aspects of the ranking framework- the data, and the parameters used to calculate the rankings.",
      "A significant component of the NIRF rankings is derived from data that had been submitted by the institutions themselves and not been verified by NIRF itself at any stage. To allay this serious concern over the integrity of the rankings, NIRF had claimed that it would be conducting periodic random verification of the submitted data and mandated the institutions to publicly display it. With different rankings getting released each year and the fourth edition having been released recently, so far no reports have been released on the verifications which NIRF had claimed it would conduct.",
      "We studied the data from the Top 10 institutes, looking through the various metrics under which they had submitted their data.",
      "IIT Bombay had submitted data to NIRF under 3 categories: Overall, Engineering, and Management. Under the Overall Category, the Median Salary of a student in the UG 4 Year course, graduating in the year 2019, had been reported as Rs. 27,87,638[1]. This value is abnormally greater than similar data from other peer institutes like IIT Delhi(Rs. 15,70,000)[2], IIT Madras(Rs. 13,60,000)[3], but more than that, it is nearly triple the amount reported by IIT Bombay itself for the previous years (For eg, in 2018- Rs. 10,11,000 and in 2017- Rs. 9,56,757)[1]. Similar is the case for the data presented under the Overall Category for the Median Salary of a student in the PG 2 Year course graduating in the year 2019, which has been reported to be Rs. 50,93,691[1] while the same value for the previous 2 years had been under Rs. 32 Lakhs[1].",
      "This is suggestive of an abnormality in the data submitted by IIT Bombay which necessitated further investigation. A report concerning the placements for the Year 2019, published in July 2019, by Placement Office, IIT Bombay, reports only 204 offers having been made across the entire graduating batch, with a salary over Rs. 16,00,000[4]. This is at odds with the data submitted to NIRF because, on inferring that, we must have had at least  (459(Placed UG 4 Year students, NIRF)+577(Placed UG 4 Year students, NIRF))/2=518 offers made of over Rs. 27,00,000[1].",
      "(Source: [1])",
      "(Source: [4])",
      "The saving grace in the entirety of this has been the fact that incidentally, NIRF does not take into account the Median Salary for calculating the overall rankings[5]. Apart from this particular instance of misrepresentation of data this year, there have been similar reports coming in with previous editions of NIRF Rankings. According to a report by The Telegraph, The University of Calcutta, which was placed at 5th amongst all universities in NIRF 2019, had reported the median salary for undergraduates who graduated in 2015-16 to be Rs. 8,04,400 but in the data presented for NIRF 2017, the same data was much lower at Rs 4,00,000 for the same set of students who had graduated in 2015-16 [6].  Considering the fact that our own study involved only a very small subset from the 1000s of institutions in the rankings, it is possible that other instances of erroneous data might exist.",
      "Due to the nature of this data coming from official sources, it poses a problem in which any person could end up getting misled by such false data regarding the placement statistics of the outgoing batch. It is even worse a situation if institutions had been deliberately sending in inflated figures, seeking to raise their rankings. Even the universities and the institutes are a stakeholder in this since these rankings might determine the amount of funding they are able to secure for themselves[7], perhaps something which might motivate further fudging of data.",
      "At first glance, the metrics used by the MHRD to rank the institutes look holistic and reasonable. As explained in one of our earlier infographic articles concerning the NIRF rankings[8], the framework takes into account the following parameters: “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”. But an in-depth analysis of the parameters and sub-parameters reveals some underlying flaws in the ranking framework.",
      "One of the shortcomings of the rankings lies with its failure to properly accommodate different academic structures under a common framework. This inability to standardize diverse structures results in some anomalies in the scores, and as a consequence, distorts the rankings to some extent. An example of this is evident in the NIRF’s treatment of Dual Degree programs. Most IITs offer explicit 5-year Dual Degree programs during the time of admission itself, whereas IITK offers no such program. Rather, IITK Undergraduate students are offered a chance to switch to a Dual Degree program during their 3rd and 4th year.",
      "Due to this, the NIRF data submitted by IITK has no separate section concerning UG 5-year students, unlike other IITs. Instead, these Dual degree students are listed under the category of “UG 4-year students opting for higher studies”. This induces a spike in IITK’s numbers in the category. The number of UG (4 years) students opting for higher studies in the other (top 4) IITs varies between 50-150, while for IITK, this number is to the north of 300.",
      "This anomaly gives a small boost to IITK’s score in the Graduation Outcome(GO) parameter.",
      "(Source: [9])",
      "Consider the following two scenarios:",
      "Scenario 1:A total of 800 students take admission under the UG 4 year program in 2016. Out of this, 200 students opt to convert to a dual degree program at a later stage. Out of the remaining 600 students, 500 students get placed/opt for higher studies from a different institute.",
      "Scenario 2:600 students take admission under the UG 4 year program, while 200 students get admitted to a dual degree program in 2016. 500 out of the 600 students get placed/opt for higher studies from a different institute.",
      "The two scenarios are virtually similar, albeit a difference in the academic structure of the institute. We would expect a similar graduation outcome metric for these two scenarios. But, the ranking metric used in NIRF results in significantly different outcomes.",
      "In the first scenario, the graduation outcome score (for the 2020 rankings) will be proportional to the ratio ⅞, while in the second scenario, it will be a factor of ⅚ . And although this may sound like an insignificant difference, the scaling of these factors leads to a significant spike in an institute’s score.",
      "In general, there is a huge diversity in the academic framework of institutions. A failure to normalize these diverse structures may cause a significant distortion in the institute rankings.",
      "Another problematic metric in the ranking framework is the State Diversity Index. The metric intends to quantify the regional diversity of an institute, by taking into account the fraction of students from other states enrolled in the institute. But the parameter tends to unfairly penalize institutes located in states with a large population. For example, Uttar Pradesh, being the most populous state, houses more than 17% of the Indian population. As a result, a random distribution of students will tend to have a greater percentage of students from Uttar Pradesh, as compared to any other state. Consequently, IITK has the highest percentage (~28%) of native students, among the top 5 IITs. This naturally affects IITK’s performance in the metric in a negative way. Similarly, IITB also ends up having a low State Diversity Index, owing to the large population of the state of Maharashtra. A better metric could be formed by normalizing the diversity index with the population of the state in which the institute is located. This would remove the bias towards states with a large population.",
      "The NIRF also has a metric for the number of PhD students graduated. The metric takes into consideration the mean of the number of PhD students that have graduated from the institute in the past 3 years. In the past years, IITK has consistently reported a lower number of PhD students as compared to the other top 4 IITs.",
      "(Source: [9])",
      "The number of research scholars that an institute can host is heavily governed by the number of faculty at that institute. A larger teaching community can naturally supervise a larger student community but the metric stated above takes into account only the raw number of students graduating over the past three years into consideration. A smaller number of graduating students could set a wrong perception of the institute and could question the capabilities of the faculties and infrastructure provided. IITK has the lowest number of faculty members among the top 5 IITs.This number is influenced by a lot of factors, one of them being the faculty strength position sanctioned by MHRD. The sanctioned faculty strength for IITK is considerably less than some of its counterparts. Thus it is natural to assume that IITK would lag behind in the number of students graduating from the institute as well.",
      "(Source: [10]",
      "The PhD program is not as aligned as the conventional UG and PG programs. The graduation outcome of a PhD program is dependent on a number of variables such as the faculty strength, the average time taken for completion of the degree, and the number of departments in an institute among others.",
      "The current method of using the mean of the number of PhD students graduating over the last three years, seems a bit primitive. NIRF should try to incorporate the different variables listed above into their framework as well, in order to construct a metric which can give better insights into the PhD program of an institute.",
      "The possibility of errors in the data submitted by institutes, combined with the unfairness of some parameters, raises some genuine concerns regarding the reliability of the NIRF rankings. The extent of the combined distortion these factors can cause is significant. Considering the wide media coverage these rankings receive, they can be misleading sometimes and might have an unfair impact on some Institutes’ reputations. At best, these rankings are just indicative and should be taken with a pinch of salt.",

      "For the first time in IIT Kanpur, Online Elections among the General Body were conducted for the formation of the Executive Committee of Hall 6. The elections, where the votes were cast on a web-based platform, were conducted by the Election Commission, Students Gymkhana. Here, Vox Populi presents a report on this process and the views of the various stakeholders on the conduction.",
      "This happens to be the first time when an online medium is to be used for polling among the general body – which though was in discussion in the Senate way back since 2017-18. The Students Senate had recommended conducting elections in an online mode way back due to them being more accessible and comfortable to the general body. Yash Maheshwari, Chairperson, Students Senate, in this regard remarks,",
      "“As the offline elections were working just fine and online elections were uncharted territory, even though recommended, the transition never happened. Now as the lockdown due to COVID-19 has forced us to shift everything online, it’s time that we start having online elections as well.”",
      "A Subcommittee was formed for the same in 2018-19, which recommended that online voting should be welcomed and that the halls should adopt the same to test and improvise the process for campus-wide implementation in the future. Vedaant Sikka, the current Convener of the Council of Students Hostel Affairs, when asked about the instigation of these elections, stated:",
      "‘The idea behind online hall elections was to ensure that the periodicity of tenures is maintained, and there is a proper scope of guidance and transfer of knowledge and experience from the previous HEC to the new teams. Thereby, considering the availability of all the necessary logistics, we decided to go with Hall 6 as the first hall to have online elections. This was announced in the first regular CoSHA Meeting on October 3, 2020, and was planned to be followed as per the Model Hall Constitution.’",
      "As an alternative to online voting, a process of nomination was followed for the Hall Administrative Body selection in Hall 2. Sahil Khan, ex-President – Hall 2, had his concerns regarding having elections. He felt that the current elections are involving Y19 students – who may not have even visited their parent hall, let alone handle it’s governance given their lack of exposure. He added, “We adopted a different structure for the Hall committee(HAB) 2 years back, which involves both 2nd and 3rd year students. Given this, the Y18 we nominated were proven executives who had previous exposure to Hall administration for an entire year. These people know the inside-out of Hall administration. Moreover, we’ve nominated only 3 people to continue the minimal functioning required from home and will proceed to election’s once the situation is more clear.”",
      "When asked why she didn’t explore the option of forming the HEC through nominations, Priya Tholia, the outgoing President of Hall 6 felt that nominations are an undemocratic procedure involving only 10 ex-HEC members. She remarked, “Those HEC members would have their personal biases, and even if not, it would not be very hard to influence them.”",
      "The election procedure began with the appointment of Chief Election Officer for Hall-6. Nominations for the same were invited in September, following which the previous HEC organized a ‘Know Your HEC’ session. The nominations were called for ten posts with a deadline for submission of manifestos two days later. Along with this, the Code of Conduct was imposed. The candidates could campaign through posters, short videos, messaging, and meetings on any video calling platform. On the last day of campaigning, a SOAP box was organized, which lasted for nearly nine hours. Elections were held on the scheduled date, 1st November, through an online portal, developed as an academic project, and maintained by the Programming Club, IIT Kanpur. The polling was conducted smoothly with results being declared almost immediately. Though the turnout was about 220, which was lesser than 295 votes last year, considering the absence of a first-year batch, who are generally considered the most active ones in the HEC elections, this number seems satisfactory.",
      "Though the logistics were well-arranged, a lot of concerns were raised on the efficacy of online elections. The major issue which surfaced was regarding the participation of people with limited to no internet connectivity. Thus, the elections were not thought to uphold the notion of democracy or provide fair chances to everyone to vote or contest, given the unfavorable conditions. The less time given for campaigning was also questioned upon, amidst the hectic ongoing online semester. Also, the genuineness and transparency of the process remained suspicious to many and there were doubts on possible misconduct or malpractices. In our discussion with Prince Kumar, (Chief Election Officer, Students Gymkhana), we were told the system was already used during the Senate meeting held in August, and the result was flawless, with a unique verification code used for registering considering just the one-day usage. We were further notified, “Other than that, for the first time, we implemented a system which sent an automatic mail whenever someone cast a vote, which verifies their vote; and all others who haven’t voted would receive a mail at the end of the voting period notifying them of the same. So in my opinion, we took care of all the issues.”",
      "However, the GBMs told that they didn’t receive a verification mail after voting. There were even residents who mentioned that they did not receive a single email and were unaware of this process until they got the voting access.",
      "To address the common doubts raised, the Election Commission floated a set of FAQs in return to these queries, stating various possible solutions. The election for the posts, where people were willing to file the candidature but were incapable currently, was postponed to future dates. A centralized repository carrying the entire election content was maintained and provided to the hall residents. As mentioned, the sizes of the uploaded files and recorded audios and videos were kept minimum, to make them accessible to all. The candidates were also affirmed to be given access to extra internet if required. The virtual campaigning process was claimed to be less time consuming and the entireties were seen as compensating the repetitive campaigning visits made in any regular campus election. Also, a tried and tested software was deployed in voting, which was asserted to be reasonably reliable and genuine.",
      "Despite all this, in general, the candidates felt restricted due to online mediums and the absence of face-to-face campaigning where GBMs could freely pose questions and concerns. Infeasibility of conducting meetings on online video calling platforms due to the hectic online semester added to their worries. They had to reach out to everyone individually or through social media posts, which was challenging. They felt that at some places, Election Commission failed to cover the gap developed due to this pandemic. Though they found the online conduction to be less tedious and faster, the alternative of the door to door campaigning was felt highly absent in the current arrangement.",
      "Despite the issues with campaigning, the candidates expected a higher voting percentage. Lastly, the candidates opined on working for the posts entirely online. They believed this scenario’s advantage is frequent HEC meetings in the online mode. Though, the possibilities of doing groundwork and establishing connections with the hall administration and workers are significantly non-existent.",
      "To gauge the success and reach of online campaigning and elections, we also reached out to the GBMs for their opinions.",
      "“To be honest, I don’t see the point of having elections if the hall isn’t open, and only Ph.D. students are on campus.” – A General Body Member",
      "Some found elections for posts of mess, canteen and gardening secretary to be unnecessary right now.",
      "Some members were a little uncomfortable with receiving personal texts from candidates on WhatsApp. They also felt the manifestos hadn’t been altered according to the needs of an online semester. A senior GBM expressed her concern regarding the lack of experience of Y19s on campus. She suggested, ” Allow only students on the campus to run for elections and vote for it because it is ultimately them who are getting affected by the decisions of the council at this point.” There was also an emphasis on UGs and PGs’ unequal representation for the posts, which was attributed to PGs’ lack of awareness as they’re still settling down on campus.",
      "Though there was optimism too regarding online elections and appreciation for the efforts put in by the EC in making the process reliable and fair, the ‘Online Election’ process still has a long way to go to be perfect. Henceforth, in the online election proceedings and with the prospect of resorting to this process for upcoming elections as well, a proposal for addressing all its pertinent aspects under one group was put forth in the Senate and the Sub-Committee is formed to examine various processes and ensure that the process is improved for General Elections 2021.",

      "The start of the first semester of the academic year 2020-21 in September 2020 marked the beginning of IITK’s first of its kind online semester. With a revamped academic calendar and a different mode of instruction, the students and the faculty braced for their first experience with the online scheme of things. With new teaching models being adopted, and diverse challenges being faced, the online semester so far has been altogether different for all campus community members. With the end of the mid-semester examinations, Vox Populi presents the results of the recently conducted survey, which aims to raise the academic and technical issues faced and brings forward the state of the mental and physical well-being of IIT Kanpur students.",
      "Vox received 1668 responses from students of different batches and also responses from the newly arrived Y20 PG community. The survey brought forward results on various aspects of the online semester, ranging from the concerns regarding the academic load, integrity in examinations, technical concerns of the students, and also shed light on the students’ mental and physical health. The survey also received suggestions from the campus community on how the online semester could be made more accommodating and be implemented better.",
      "",
      "Academic Concerns",
      "With the start of the spring semester from September, the semester had to be compressed to a duration of 3 months instead of the usual 4 month semester. One noticed aftermath is the apparent increase in academic load faced by the students. With six working days in a semester and a new model of instruction, students raised concerns regarding the increased academic load. 56.1% of students responded that the number of scheduled hours for courses is more than the credits allotted to the courses. Further, while 55.2% stated that they faced the above issue in only 1 or 2 courses, 36.1% said that this was the case in about 2-4 of their courses while 8.7% stated that this was the case in more than 4 courses. Possible reasons for such a reaction could be the addition of discussion hours and additional lecture hours per week due to the compression of the semester duration.",
      "",
      "One of the key elements of the online semester has been the continuous evaluation policy being adopted by instructors of several courses. The survey also gauged the number of assignments/quizzes that students had to appear for in a week.",
      "",
      "Overall, around 43% of students had up to 4 quizzes/assignments to appear for in a week, at the same time, about 5% had to appear for more than 8 assessments in a week. Across batches, while the older Y17 and Y16 have about 50% students which have less than 4 assessments a week, while at the same time Y18 and Y19 have about 65% students appearing for more than 4 quizzes/assignments in a week. The Y20 PG batch has about 60% of students appearing for less than 4 assessments in a week.",
      "Another policy implemented in the current semester was the re-exam conduction for the 2019-20 II semester. The survey brought forward numbers about how many students appeared for the re-examinations and if they felt that it added to their academic load and hampered their performance.",
      "",
      "15% of respondents, which is 248 students, opted to appear for the re-examination. Out of these, close to 91% of students responded that the re-examinations of the previous semester was added academic load and hindered their academic performance.",
      "Communication between instructors and students has been one of the key challenges that had to be addressed in the conduct of the online semester. While 61% of the respondents were able to correspond with their instructors/tutors more often than not, the remaining 39% of students faced challenges and issues in communicating their academic/ technical queries to their instructors.",
      "",
      "Technical Issues faced by students",
      "The online scheme of instruction also meant the adoption of online platforms for teaching and discussions. With MooKIT and other platforms being used for lectures and conducting assessments, the survey gauged if the students were facing any issues with online platforms being used and any other technical queries that the students had.",
      "",
      "While close to 54% of students said that they did not face technical issues, about 41% of students responded that they faced a lack of adequate internet speed/stability to attend lectures and appear for examinations putting them at a disadvantage. About 7.6% also stated that they did not possess the necessary specifications of devices(phones/laptops) to cope up regularly with the academic load.",
      "With regard to MooKIT and other platforms, about 36% of respondents complained that they faced technical glitches during assessments quite often. With the progress of the semester, MooKIT too has seen several improvements but it is evident that the students are still having technical concerns with its user interface.",
      "Issues with course policies and assessments",
      "The survey also asked respondents if they faced any unreasonable demands from professors which went over the guidelines issued by DoAA. The students raised several issues some of which included the following:",
      "1. Lack of technical support during assessments. A number of students raised concerns on how mailing their answer copies within time limits to instructors/TAs were not considered for grading when they faced technical glitches with the MooKIT system.",
      "2. Assessments deviating from course-syllabus and requiring students to use the internet to find answers to questions in quizzes/examinations.",
      "3. Difficulty in understanding lab-oriented courses in online mode of instruction due to absence of lab-component.",
      "4. Instructor conducting proctored examinations which require high data and internet stability for longer hours and also require camera/scanner apart from mobile/laptop.",
      "Several students also raised issues with frequent changes in grading policies and harsh grading schemes in order to curb cheating which resulted in negative scores and averages. A number of students also said how the continuous evaluation paradigm in certain courses was being implemented with several quizzes being held at once to cover up for earlier weeks.",
      "The academic takeaway from the online semester has also been one of the key points of discussion. The survey asked the respondents about how satisfied they were with the academics in the online semester till the mid-semester examinations. The question fetched the following responses batchwise:",
      "",
      "While the batch-wise picture can be seen from the graphs above indicating how a large percentage of every batch is finding the academics to not be satisfactory, In the overall sense, more than 65% of respondents are not satisfied with the academics in the online semester with 558 respondents(33.5%) showing extreme dissatisfaction. Only 36 respondents(2.2%) were extremely satisfied and 140 respondents(8.4%) are very satisfied with the academics in the online semester.",
      "Health Issues",
      "The current semester has also brought about a new way of life for the student community and its effect on the health of the students was also brought forward with responses to the survey.",
      "",
      "With the screens replacing blackboards and study tables becoming lecture halls, drastic numbers came forward with regard to the screen time of students in the online semester.",
      "47% of students had more than 10 hours of average screen time and about 33% of students had more than 7 hours of screen time daily, In the cumulative sense, implying that about more than 80% of students were spending more than 7 hours in front of a screen every day!",
      "",
      "Another surprising number was how over 60% of students were getting less than 6 hours of average sleep every day. Apart from these concerns, many students complained of Insomnia, High-Stress levels, Anxiety, and Tinnitus due to excessive use of earphones, Migraines, Sleep Apnea, and loss of appetite.",
      "",
      "Students staying at home also meant for some subtle changes in their lifestyles. One important aspect is the addition of household chores and family responsibilities.  About 46% of students responded that the addition of these responsibilities has affected their academic performance in the semester to a significant extent. The other key aspect of change in the lifestyle of students is the absence of peers for discussions. More than 74% of students responded that they seldom and rarely get to have non-academic/academic discussions with their peer group in comparison to the usual semester. It was also found that around 88% of respondents could not spare time for any recreational activities in the current semester. Few students mentioned how the semester has left them with no time to pursue their hobbies and interests as they have some or the other quiz/assignment to appear for daily. Numerous students also expressed how they were not having any social interactions outside of their homes.",
      "",
      "A very important number for the current semester that came forward from the survey results is ‘How stressed are the students?’. While the offline semester also had its fair share of stress, around 50% of students responded that they found the online semester to be extremely stressful. Overall, close to 85% of respondents found the semester to be very stressful and the numbers indicate how the issues and concerns highlighted above have accumulated to make this semester a very difficult ride for the students.",
      "",
      "Suggestions",
      "Ample issues and suggestions were put forward by students with regard to how the semester could be improved and certain changes and suggestions could be acted upon to make the semester more friendly to cope up with.",
      "1. Students expressed their concerns regarding the prevalence of cheating in assessments through the online mode and suggested having innovative and improved evaluation means. Cases of mass cheating were also brought forward which resulted in high average scores. Suggestions included introducing group-based assessments for evaluations and to introduce new examination patterns instead of the usual policies which were followed in the offline semester.",
      "2. Several students also suggested that the courses follow the DoAA guidelines for the conduct of courses and that the duration of lectures be as per the 50 minutes lecture-35 minute video metric and that the lectures for the week be uploaded in advance for the students to cover up on the topics beforehand.",
      "3. With uncertain internet stability and electricity and connectivity issues being faced by students from different parts of the country, it was suggested that surprise quizzes and attendance policies allow certain leeway and room for improvement for students who face issues during lectures/assessments. It was also suggested to provide ample time in case the assessment included having to scan and upload files to online platforms.",
      "4. A number of concerns were brought forward regarding the lack of availability of lecture slides and low-quality audio/video in recorded lectures, these could be improved upon as the semester proceeds into its later half.",
      "5. Some students also raised concerns regarding a lack of response by instructors/tutors in mails and also about tutorial timings being shifted as per the convenience of tutors. While uncertainties prevail due to several circumstances, these concerns can be addressed and be remedied by the instructors/tutors.",
      "6. Several suggestions included the need for a break from the continuous evaluation paradigm and the need for a recess or a couple of short breaks in the semester to have a break from the academic load in the current semester. With six working days in a week and continuous assessments and lectures to be viewed, the semester has been an uphill task for students to get through.",
      "With the mid-semester examinations coming to an end and the regular academics resuming, the students get ready for the second half of the online semester journey. Apart from the concerns and suggestions put forward by the student community, the most prominent suggestion among all was how being back on campus would make the semester less stressful, closer to their friends, and bring back a sense of normalcy. With the responses received, many academic and non-academic concerns could be resolved in the second half, and it remains to be seen how the students fare in their first tryst with the online scheme of things. With about 6 weeks remaining in the online semester, students gear up to face the remainder of the online semester aiming to improve their academic scores and to hopefully get in a better state of mental and physical well-being.",

      "To understand the grievances and complaints of NCC cadets with the current NCC management and initiate a dialogue on the same, Vox Populi conducted a survey of students enrolled in NCC this year and received 175 responses.While most students raised grave concerns about class timings, insensitivity of the colonel, unproductive classes and condition of uniforms, others found these complaints absurd and unfair to raise. Here are our detailed findings-",
      "",
      "According to the official schedule of classes approved by DoSA and SPEC, the time of the NCC classes must be 0840-1140 hours (3 hours).",
      "However, two major problems exist-",
      "1. NCC office plans classes generally from 0820 to 1140 hours (3 hrs 20 mins), as specified in emails sent by NCC office. On certain days, the class timings are even beyond that. For example, according to an NCC email, the class on 8th February was planned from 0810 to 1210 hours, which is asubstantial-60 minutes morethan the approved NCC time(i.e. 0840-1140 hours- 3 hrs).",
      "2. NCC classes get delayed, even beyond the already increased time mentioned in the email sent out.",
      "When we asked NCC cadets if the classes end on time,only 4%of the 175 respondents said that the classes‘always end on time.’An overwhelming 57.1% respondents think that the classes ‘always get delayed’ and 31.4% respondents think that the classes ‘often get delayed.’",
      "[infogram id=”1867f141-a2ee-46f6-9e74-1b20e902866e” prefix=”Nve” format=”interactive” title=”NCC Timings”]",
      "Apart from the extended lectures/drill time, a major chunk of the delay can be attributed to a long time spent in taking attendance.",
      "We asked NCC students to choose, which of the following is closest to the time spent in taking attendance: >60, 60, 45, 30, 15 and <15 minutes. An alarming95.4 percent cadets think that NCC spends 30 minutes or more in taking attendance.",
      "This extremely alarming waste of NCC cadets’ time can be reasoned to ‘poor crowd control,’practice of taking attendance twicefor each class andpen-and-paper attendance mode, instead of the institute-wide standard of biometric attendance.",
      "[infogram id=”807098e0-f631-4ad2-b742-9c1870fb83eb” prefix=”6gE” format=”interactive” title=”NCC Attendance”]",
      "Hence,planning classes for more than the time approved,extending classes beyond the time plannedandspending unreasonably high amounts of time in conducting attendanceare the key time-related problems students face with NCC.",
      "A number of incidents we received have highlighted insensitivity and lack of empathy from the NCC colonel towards issues faced by the cadets. Some of the incidents that our respondents mentioned were-",
      "1. In an NCC activity, the cadets were asked to come on stage and speak on a particular topic for about 2 minutes in English. A student, who wasn’t fluent in English was forced to speak. When he tried to speak in English, the colonel asked, ‘What was your score in CBSE English Exam in 12th Standard?’ The student replied that he got 86 marks. The colonel reportedly said, ‘Ye hai CBSE ke checking ka level!’",
      "2. A number of our respondents said that when they asked the colonel for an exemption from physical activities due to medical conditions/injuries, backed by HC prescription as proof, not only were they denied such exemptions, but also were treated hurtfully with remarks like ‘get lost’ and ‘I don’t care.’ In a shocking incident during the class of 1st February, the colonel unwilling to listen, and allegedly threw away a cadet’s HC booklet in front of the entire class. The student reportedly felt insulted and scared after the incident. In another case, a student, who had an appointment with an opthamologist in HC, requested the colonel to allow him to leave about 15 minutes earlier. The colonel denied permission, leaving the student with no option but to defer his eye checkup as the opthamologist is only available on Saturday mornings, when the student has NCC classes and he cannot afford another holiday.",
      "3. At least 8 of our respondents told us about incidences where they were marked as absent because they came to the class in civil clothes, since their uniform was damaged or unavailable in their size. In one of the cases, the student talked to the NCC staff about his uniform before the class started, and the staff empathising with his problem, allowed him to attend the class. However, after about an hour when the colonel came to the class, he asked the student to leave the class for not wearing a uniform. The student told the colonel that his staff had allowed him. The colonel was unwilling to listen to the student, said that he doesn’t care what the staff says and asked him to leave.",
      "4. While the colonel is not bound to allow exemptions in any of the above cases, these allegedlyrepeated instances of mocking and ridiculing students might be concerning.",
      "[infogram id=”94ffb864-d771-4fab-9454-958337d0e4a5″ prefix=”LFf” format=”interactive” title=”Attitude of Colonel”]",
      "While over half of our respondents (54.9%) find the behaviour of the NCC colonel too harsh and unjustified, a significant share (almost a quarter) of our respondents think that the NCC colonel isstrict and polite but not harsh. Another 18.9% respondents think that while the behaviour of the NCC colonel is harsh, it is justified.",
      "According to one of the respondents, “I found that everyone of us (including me) is indisciplined and openly defies orders. The colonel is right to inculcate the attitude of an army man to dress and groom ourselves properly and learn how to obey and bring objection to orders.”",
      "A lot of respondents raisedthe issue of the uniformsissued by NCC, which apparently are torn/damaged and seem to be very old. When we asked our respondents to rate the condition of their NCC uniform out of 5, we received anaverage rating of 2.019 on 5.While some students faced problems like unavailability of the uniform in their size, some respondents found the issue of uniform ‘absurd’ and said that ‘if someone has a problem, they can buy a new one from the market as is done in NCC elsewhere.’",
      "",
      "[infogram id=”2bcd416a-b098-442e-92d2-aeb0c0dfaecb” prefix=”E3Z” format=”interactive” title=”Uniform”]",
      "A large number of our respondents felt that the NCC lectures arehighly unproductive. When asked to rate the productivity of the lectures on a scale of 1-5 (1 being highly unproductive, and 5 being highly productive), 41.7% of the respondents gave it a rating of 1, while another 23.4% chose 2. Only 11.5% of people thought that the lectures were somewhat productive, thereby expressing the sentiment that the lectures were largely unproductive and students hardly learnt anything.However, some of our respondents appreciated the Leadership Lecture series and found them ‘motivating.’",
      "[infogram id=”75755f73-375e-4eaa-a348-ddce0e7bf8cf” prefix=”VRr” format=”interactive” title=”Productivity”]",
      "A respondent pointed out that the IIT Kanpur chapter of NCC does not fit in with the objective behind the PE course, as it neither leads to any sort of personality development, nor is it any form of physical exercise.Another issue with NCC has been lack of proper email communication. A lot of students haven’t been receiving emails about class timings and hence, often miss their classes. When lack of information about class was presented by some students as their justification for being absent, the colonel said that it isn’t NCC’s responsibility to send email as a notice had been put and email sent were only for convenience, while notice is the primary means of communication.",
      "NCC at other IITs",
      "Vox reached out to a couple of our sister IITs to get the perspective of cadets at their respective NCC camps. A few important points were put forward in the feedback, A cadet from NCC at IIT Delhi stated that “Taking up NCC is a totally optional and only about 40 out of 1200 student take up NCC” he also mentioned how the uniforms of the cadets were tailored to their sizes and were provided by the NCC Office. Another point that was clearly stated was that all the time during the NCC hours were spent training as cadets. A cadet from IIT Bombay also provided feedback stating how the cadets were provided lectures on relevant cadet training and that the NCC hours were spent in a manner that involved cadet training as well as sports training. A discipline perk that was followed was that every cadet that arrived late was made to push ups.",
      "NCC at our sister IITs somehow paints a significantly different picture from the NCC CPA at IITK. Even though the NCC Offices at different institutes might operate independently but a lot of improvisations could be implemented to provide a better and wholesome NCC experience for the cadets at IITK.",
      "Suggestions",
      "The NCC office did not reply to our email asking for their response to the above mentioned complaints. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions we received from our respondents for NCC, IIT Kanpur-",
      "1. Respecting Students’ Time– The time table of the classes must be followed strictly, in line with that approved by the SPEC. Unacceptably large amounts of time wasted in the process of taking attendance, may be reduced with the help of biometric attendance and more efficient management. Also, currently, cadets are taken to NCC office (from lecture halls/PE ground) just to conduct attendance. This wastes a lot of time in transit which may be saved.",
      "2. Change/Improvement in NCC Leadership– NCC IITK Chapter requires a leadership which listens to students’ issues, takes in feedback and is more empathetic about it.",
      "3. Channel to Raise Complaints-A channel must be provided (through DoSA/SPEC/NCC) to raise complaints anonymously, given the absurd incidences of inhumane and unacceptable behaviour of the colonel. Currently, while the students are highly dissatisfied, there is hardly anything they can do about it as they are scared that the colonel would fail them if they speak against him.",
      "4. No student must be forced to take NCC involuntarily, due to lack of seats in other CPA. In the words of one of our respondents, “most of the students are literally pushed to do something, do not choose it and hence come to the classes unwillingly. Therefore it is being taken for granted.”",
      "5. Providing better/newer uniforms– Torn pants/shirts, pants with missing zips and shirts with missing buttons must be replaced/repaired.",
      "6. Physical and Mental Well-Being of cadets– A number of instances were highlighted where the cadets were subject to humiliation in front of their fellow cadets and were made to feel embarrassed. Despite the nature of strictness to be followed in NCC, the cadets must be treated with respect and not be humiliated publicly.",
      "7. Meaningful NCC sessions– The lectures/activities conducted during the NCC sessions should be planned and meaningful. As one of our respondents mentioned, “NCC should stop selling a career in the armed forces.” The SPEC could monitor what is being done in NCC class and ask for a class by class plan.",
      "8. Clarity about Attendance Criteria– Several students complained of lack of proper information regarding attendance criteria in the CPA. It was suggested that a clear cut attendance policy be issued to every cadet before every semester to make sure that there each student has clarity on the policy.",
      "9. Joining NCC and forging of signatures in the declaration form– At the time of joining NCC, all cadets are to give a written declaration stating that the NCC bears no responsibility in case of an injury/death in the NCC drills. This declaration also requires the signature of the parents of the cadets. As the cadets come from various parts of the country, it is not feasible for them to visit their parents in the middle of a semester. As a recourse, it is actively suggested by the NCC regiment to forge signatures on the declaration form. A good way could be to ask this permission in the orientation itself, along with other documents.",

      "To contribute to the country’s fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic, our institute, IIT Kanpur has had a significant role in  Commercializing three ground-breaking innovative healthcare solutions within three months, with the help of some of the startups incubated here. Here in this article, we would be covering the products and the people behind it all.",
      "————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-",
      "The Ventilator",
      "Learning from the western countries, many entrepreneurs in India had already started preparing equipment like Ventilators and PPE Kits for the times when the hospitals would be facing severe crises in different parts of our country. One of the leaders in this race of innovation were the co-founders of Nocca Robotics – a start-up established in 2017 by two of IIT Kanpur’s alumni: Mr. Nikhil Kurele and Mr. Harshit Rathore. They took up the challenge and came up with an affordable full-fledged, ICU-grade ventilator which is now being supplied to various hospitals throughout the country.",
      "This ventilator system is indigenously developed by Nocca Robotics and IIT Kanpur under the supervision of Prof. Bandyopadhyay after discussions with doctors and medical professionals. Initially, Nocca was in the process of building a pressure-controlled ventilator, aimed only to cater the needs of COVID-19 patients but during the process, several other guidelines, laid out by the government, were taken into account and what they ended up with is anICU-grade ventilator approved by the Technical Evaluation Committee constituted by Government of India",
      "",
      "One of the key features  of the said ventilator is its ability to reduce the risk of the spread of coronavirus through the patient. When a COVID-19 patient exhales or coughs, the air is loaded with droplets containing the virus, which is extremely infectious. This ventilator has UV chambers which kill the virus and reduce the viral load of the exhaled air. The ventilator can run on ambient air, eliminating the requirement of medical air supply line. Another notable feature of the ventilator is it’s portability, so it can be used in locations other than the hospital to handle the patients. It is much more energy-economic than the regular ventilators, so it can work on battery for at least 4 hours.",
      "Being a medical equipment of vital significance, quality testing, and maintaining high standards were of utmost importance, so all the testing has been done and passed. By the end of July, production of about 5,000 units is expected and if the demand intensifies, it could be ramped up to 15,000 units by mid-August. India’s leading missile and ammunition manufacturer PSUBharat Dynamics Limitedis manufacturing the ventilator, while Indian medical device maker Avi Health Care is also on board to assist during the manufacturing process. In the May edition of‘Mann ki Baat’, the PM praised Nocca Robotics and IIT Kanpurfor this initiative.",
      "SaniWalk, a contactless full-body Disinfectant Chamber",
      "Considering that the infection is spreading like wildfire, preventing the spread is as necessary as the cure, perhaps more. Nevertheless, the hard closure of the economy has cost many people terribly, so it becomes the need of the hour to re-open the markets and public places. But this raises the question: how can we flatten the curve? To deal with this problem, Cupro HealthTech, headed by Dr. Madhu Vasepalli, has devised a solution:SaniWalk, a contactless full-body sanitization system.",
      "Cupro HealthTech, a Hyderabad based company incubated at the Startup Innovation and Incubation Centre, IIT Kanpur came into existence in the early days of this COVID crisis. They started out as a team of 3 people only, but have now grown to about 15 members, with 5 interns from IIT Kanpur itself. According to Dr. Vasepalli, the concept was quite vague initially, but with the able and ample support of IIT-Kanpur, especially Ms. Aditi Kumar and Prof. Bandyopadhyay, they could materialise the design. Later, Prof. Sarvanan Matheshwaran helped in fine-tuning the system.",
      "Talking with Dr Vasepalli, he told us that, “A disinfection chamber works regardless of the fact that the incoming person might not be a suspected case. So we thought of developing a process which would be far more efficient in utilizing the resources. The most common symptom is fever. So we developed an AI-powered contactless temperature detecting system. If the person is detected with fever, the door for the spray chamber would not open, and he would not be allowed to go into the public, if this is installed in public places.” They have installed a facial recognition camera which would help in maintaining all the records in a central server for multiple entries of an individual.",
      "",
      "",
      "On 16th of June,the Government of India through their official twitter handle, commended Dr. Vasepalli and his team over this innovation.Currently, the first of its kind, this chamber has been successfully installed in AIG Hospital, Hyderabad.",
      "SWASA N95 Masks Manufacturing Facility",
      "The N95 masks which got fame due to increasing pollution in North India were also one of the affordable gear for protection against COVID-19 infection. Since the emergence of the COVID crisis, E-Spin Nanotech, another IITK startup has produced about 70 lakh ‘SWASA’ N95 and N99 masks, which are being used across the nation.",
      "Headed by Dr. Sandip Patil, E-Spin was formed back in 2010 under the aegis of SIIC, IITK. In the last decade, it has evolved into a full-fledged company, which is specialised in making nano-fiber and allied products.",
      "Recently, their focus has shifted towards antibacterial and anti-viral nanofibers. Dr. Sandip told us:",
      "“We are already working on nanofiber-based antimicrobial membranes. These can be used in the pharmaceutical industry, in our homes for household sanitization, A/C for air purification, and also in automobiles. These would be washable and reusable, so you don’t have to throw them away after the use.”",
      "",
      "This is a first-of-its-kind initiative by any IIT or a Technology Business Incubator of an academic institution of India.",
      "Dr. Nikhil Agarwal, the CEO of FIRST, IIT Kanpur, who has been ensuring that products and innovations like these are quickly commercialized, said-",
      "“We are pretty sure to fulfill the demands of the people. Earlier, N-95 masks were imported in India due to insufficient local production, so it cost us about Rs. 300 per mask but thanks to this setup, we are able to cut short its price to just about Rs. 50 and also have a similar quality like the imported ones. Due to the steep rise in the number of COVID-19 patients, the consumption of masks dramatically increased. In the campus itself, masks are being used by healthcare workers, staff members, and the general public.”",
      "On June 18th, the Director of our institute inaugurated the ‘SWASA’ mask manufacturing facility in the IITK campus. Talking about this development, he said,",
      "“The completely automated facility can produce 25,000 masks daily. The idea behind this initiative is to contribute to the country’s collective effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.This is just one of many efforts by IIT Kanpur to develop innovative solutions to tackle the ever-quick spread of the virus, and devising a cure for it. Ever since the virus tapped into our nation, it has been wreaking havoc on every sphere of humankind. In India, the disease has had a major effect on the unorganised sector and the people involved, with many of them losing their jobs. It has clearly given a huge blow to our economy, but one of the biggest issues that the disease has highlighted is definitely the inadequacy of resources in the healthcare sector.",
      "Here at IIT Kanpur, the efforts to develop innovative and affordable solutions were started right around mid-March. Ever since, professors, researchers, entrepreneurs and students have been working hard to come up with solutions, which are not only highly functional, but also cost-effective.”",
      "Prof. Bandyopadhyay, the Professor-In-Charge of SIIC, has not only been involved in these innovations, but has also been overseeing the various projects and their development. Talking about these innovations, he said –",
      "“As promised, a highly sophisticated, human safe, intelligent disinfection tunnel developed bySIIC incubated company Cupro Health Tech has been commercialized. The first unit was installed at AIG Hospital, Hyderabad. Moreover, the Nocca Robotics team, have made sales demonstrations for its low cost ventilators in two hospitals by respective state government orders, as of now. Mass manufacturing at one location has started. The same at 2 more locations will start within the next 2 weeks. The alacrity with which my colleagues responded to make all this happen fills me with pride.”",

This is also a bulletin for all news related to Corona Virus and it’s possible implications on IIT Kanpur. Please keep checking the page for more updates related to the issue.",
      "Until Monday, Kanpur had witnessed 3 suspected cases out of which one woman belongs to Kalyanpur as stated by Mr. Ashok Shukla, the Chief Medical Officer of Kanpur (as of Monday). Naturally, it has created a state of stress in our campus, as in the previous 3-4 days, 8 students returned to the city from countries like Belgium, Germany, Brazil, Thailand, and Singapore, although no symptoms of the virus have been witnessed in the suspects, the Medical Health team of the city are having a close watch on them.",
      "With mid-sem break coming to a close soon, students from different parts of India would be coming to the campus, making the situation more vulnerable. One of our correspondents enquired Dr. Mamta Vyas, Head HC IIT Kanpur, regarding thison Monday.",
      "What is the current state of diagnosis equipment in HC and Kanpur city in general?",
      "Currently, HC IIT Kanpur or Kanpur City does not have the equipment to diagnose the disease, only a handful of GOI centers exist across the nation for such diagnosis. Although samples can be sent to these centers after obtaining the required permissions from the District Collector.",
      "Soon, a lot of students would be coming back home from different parts of the country. Are there any plans for screening, as students arrive post-mid sem break?",
      "Since GOI does not have any directives or guidelines for domestic travel as of now, we do not have a plan for the influx of students post-mid sem break. We would be discussing this with the Institute Administration as soon as possible.",
      "The Institute administration has been active in coming up with the minimal measures that can prevent the pandemic. TheDean of Academic Affairs recently circulated a mail which announced the adoption of the following measures:-",
      "1. Biometric attendance facilities for the UG students in LHC and PG students in all the departments have been suspended until further notice, the PG students have been advised to mark their attendance manually in registers maintained by their department.",
      "2. Institute travel support to Ph.D. students for conferences abroad is being suspended until further notice.",
      "A short mail was also circulated by HC on Thursday where campus residents were asked to inform if they had undertaken any official/personal travel outside India, in the last thirty days.",
      "They had also issued somebasic protective measures against coronavirus, from the official page of IIT Kanpur:-",

      "With a cup of cutting chai and Parle-G at 8, the work started for the day while you managed to attend and stay awake during your 9 am class. All of us have witnessed dozens of workers amidst the concrete covers, wearing helmets and the accompanying huge machinery – excavators, cranes, concrete mixtures, piles of bricks, cement and mortar. These are just the daily view of ongoing construction that doesn’t escape the eyes of any campus resident (Who manages to make it out of their rooms). In a couple of years, the fruit of us breathing in dust and that concrete smell so often would be enjoyed by the new incoming batches. We believe that everyone should be aware of what all buildings are going to be erected all around the campus.

      "Next to the new core labs, a new building for labs is under construction. More labs! Yay? The project, which started in March 2018, was initially planned to be completed by March 2020, but we live in India. As per the current progress, the work is likely to continue the entire year. The plan was approved by our former director, Dr. Manindra Agarwal, and was assigned a massive budget of 109 crores (approx).“The building is 5 storied and larger than the present core labs,” said the security officer in the area. The project is securely managed by Swadeshi Civil Infrastructure and is under fast pace construction with 12-hour everyday work timings.",
      "",
      "Aerospace Department Building:",
      "Next to the top-secret posh building named IME, the construction of the aerospace department building is in progress. The retrofitting of the building has been underway from September 2018 and is aiming for completion by the end of 2020. It is supposed to be a 6-floor tall building with a basement and other amenities, including fire alarms, CCTV systems, and a Building Management System(BMS) for centralized management of the infrastructure. The project cost is estimated to be under 58 crores.",
      "National Aerosol Facility:Besides the sixth avenue, around the New Core Labs, the National Aerosol facility center is being extended from the ground plus three floors to seven floors. Currently, the fourth floor of the center has the Technopark, which is an independent non-profit company supported by the institute. The upbuilding four stories are to be taken up by Technopark itself. The work has just started, and its completion shouldn’t take more than just a year, ideally.",

      "Computer Centre (CC):",
      "Under the first phase of the National Supercomputing Mission(NSM), an advanced supercomputer delivering 1.6 petaflops is being installed at the computer center. In human terms, 50 million people would all have to make a calculation at the same time, every second, for an entire year, to match what it can do in just one second. ‘The estimated cost of its set up is around 40 crores for the machines, with an additional 5 crore expense on infrastructure.’ informed Mr. Brajesh Pandey, Principal Computer Engineer.",
      "Core Labs Extension:",
      "Between the TA101 lab and the DoAA canteen, aka the neutral ground, yes, you guessed it right, even more labs are being constructed! The framework is targeting a basement and 3 stories, kindred to the established labs around the area. The work was destined to be completed by April this year. Still, witnessing the condition, it will undoubtedly take more than a year. The estimated cost is around 10 crores.",
      "Library:",
      "One of the most awaited construction updates is of the fountain in front of the library, which has been dysfunctional for around 7 years, and there are no signs of its revival. Sources say it will be made into a Japanese Water Garden, which you can witness for yourself if you’re seated at a good vantage point nearby. The work is undertaken, and the area is all covered, ultimately disrupting your field of vision. All one can hope for is a dramatic transformation of the ground to bring back the lost fascination of all. Or one can be delighted by the fact that the area won’t serve as a breeding ground for tadpoles, waterborne diseases and fungi in monsoon anymore.",

      "Access to safe drinking water is essential to health and a basic human right. The increasing reliance on mineral water bottles hints towards a general dissatisfaction with the taste or the quality of water available at our disposal. A number of instances of water-borne diseases further made us think if the water available to us is actually fit enough?",
      "In an attempt to understand the issue, we went around and collected water samples and analyzed them alongside WHO and BIS standards. We followed it up with discussions with relevant people. Here, we put forth a brief of what we learned.",
      "Let us first understand the term ‘good water’. There are two aspects to it- one psychological and the other physical.",
      "The psychological aspect is about one’s subconscious acceptance of the water one’s drinking.“Objectionable taste or odor may be regarded by consumers as unsafe and rejected. In extreme cases, consumers may avoid aesthetically unacceptable but otherwise safe drinking water in favor of more pleasant but potentially unsafe sources. It is therefore wise to be aware of consumer perceptions and to take into account both health-related guideline values and aesthetic criteria when assessing drinking-water supplies and developing regulations and standards.” –Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, World Health Organisation(See Acceptability Aspects on page 219)",
      "The physical aspect is concerned with the presence of certain chemical and biological matter that makes water harmful for consumption. We shall consider the standards laid down by theBureau of Indian Standardsin their latest revision of theDrinking Water – Specificationsdocument. The document has provided two limits- anAcceptable limit,and aMaximum Permissible Limit, which isonlyvalid in the absolute absence of an alternate source of water.",
      "Now, let’s have a look at how the water quality data of theInstitute Works Department (IWD)holds up against these standards-",
      "",
      "",
      "IWD Link-http://iitk.ac.in/iwd/wq/waterquality.htm",
      "Some notable observations:",
      "",
      "The best way to learn about something is to do it. So, Vox bought a TDS meter and went around a few places to collect drinking water data. Unsurprisingly, these were a few results-",
      "",
      "",
      "We approached the Health Centre staff with this question. While they did not agree to reveal the exact numbers on the same, they said, “Water quality influenced diseases are associated with metallic, salt-based and biological contaminants. Specifically, microbial impurities trigger the more common diseases among students like diarrhea, hepatitis A, and worm related infections. However, supposedly the water available on campus is biological matter free.”",
      "An institute level drive to install ROs seems an obvious solution, right? We consulted Mr. Snehil Saluja, President, Hall of Resident 12, to understand the process involved and the challenges involved.",
      "Problem–Installing ROs in half of the wings one by one took over a year. One of the biggest challenges in managing the waste water generated in the process. For every litre of processed water, four litres of water are wasted. Harvesting this impure water is a challenge.",
      "Expenditure–The expenditure for installing ROs is completely taken from DCF (Dean’s Capital Fund). HEC submits a proposal including complaints about water quality, TDS reports, number of ROs required and other valid reasons for the need of ROs in the DoSA office and if it is approved, HEC gets the required funds. The cost of installing one 40 litres RO system can be about Rs. 42000 to 50000.",
      "Maintenance–For maintenance of these ROs, an AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) is taken. Maintenance includes things such as cleaning of filters and keeping regular checks on TDS levels in the water. The first year of maintenance is covered under warranty and after that about Rs. 10000-12000 are required per RO for maintenance.",
      "Finally, we approached the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning (DoIP) to understand the processes involved and challenges in the maintenance of drinking water.",
      "There are three sources of water for us- Kanpur Municipal Corporation, groundwater, and rainwater. He says,“The institute has paid loads of money to the municipal corporation already, but they haven’t been able to set up a stable supply inside the campus and the quality of water they provide is deplorable too.”So, the water we are consuming, as of now, is mainly from the groundwater source (taken from a depth of around 1000 feet) which, he says,“is pure too since it is passed through high-pressure pipelines and isn’t treated with chlorine which is carcinogenic.”",
      "He discouraged the installation of ROs in the halls and claimed that he will not be providing any funds for the same. ROs, as he says, lead to a huge loss of water and remove certain minerals required for the body too. For the same reasons, he opines, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already banned RO filters in Delhi and said that he wishes to implement the same in IIT Kanpur. He claims that the UV based filtering is good enough and he uses the same in his home.",
      "The other source of water, that we as a campus need to stress more upon, is the rainwater. In the present scenario, rainwater harvesting is the need of the hour. Expressing his concern he says,“Since we might soon run into a water shortage, it is of extreme importance that we set up facilities for rainwater harvesting inside the campus. I have forwarded numerous proposals and attempted to do the same, but haven’t received financial support from the administration.”He urged the students to chip in as a community, come up with measures to save water and be economical in its usage. Rainwater harvesting is of utmost importance and we need to push for it.",

      "On 4th November 2019, Mr. Abhishek Aryan Sinha, a final year undergraduate student and a current resident of Hall of Residence 1 wrote an email to the Dean of Student’s Affairs expressing his concerns over various issues the hall residents had been facing.",
      "Two days later, on 6th November 2019, while Abhishek was out for a lecture, he received multiple calls from the hall office which he could not respond to then. On calling back, he was informed that the hall warden wanted to meet him urgently in the hall office. Abhishek demanded a formal mail regarding the same which he never received.",
      "After the lecture, he received another call from one of his wingmates informing him that some hall office staff had come looking for him in the wing. Finding Abhishek absent they had locked up his room with a lock they brought with themselves.",
      "Later on the same day, Abhishek received another request to see the warden. As he had a pre-scheduled meeting with the Director at the same time he replied in negative. Soon after, he received a text from his wingmate that his room had been unlocked by a hall office staff. Post concluding his meeting with the Director, Abhishek alongside a few other hall residents met the wardens. The discussion on the various hall related issues followed.",
      "On being questioned about why was Abhishek’s room locked, the warden clarified that the room had been locked for the safety of his belongings. They searched for Abhishek in the hall and when they could not find him he ordered the staff to lock his room. Students argued that other rooms of the hall were also unlocked but they were not subjected to the same action. The act of locking the room, they argued, is not a routine practice and was purposefully done targeting Abhishek.",
      "The warden had recently sent out an email to the hall, a part of which read, “For your information, hall premise is not a private place which includes your room. Hence, you may not do what you indent do at your home, which is considered as your private place.” Some students had also reported a verbal order asking them to keep the door ajar when someone from the opposite sex was present inside. When questioned on the same the warden argued that having your door locked with a girl inside raises doubts. The warden further added, as has been reported by the students present at the meeting, “For your information, Sir, I have seen a girl and a boy naked.” He particularly stressed on the fact that we are living in India and not the USA. On further argument, he concluded, “You guys can do whatever you want. I am not anymore going to follow that one (on his previous orders). You want to lock, lock! You can bring one, two, ten (talking about the issue of having girls in the room), I’m okay with it.” He further concluded that he was okay with all that the students do and they can go and spoil themselves.",
      "Thereafter, several students present at the meeting, report that the warden shouted at Abhishek for mailing his grievance, claiming that he was trying to defame the hall management and the wardens and reiterating that there were no such issues in the hostel. The warden said that not keeping him in CC while registering a complaint with DoSA was, for him, an attempt to defame him and the hall. When students argued that even after multiple complaints there has been no action from the hall administration, the warden replied that he was unaware of the issues because the hall lacked proper communication channels. He insisted the students to file complaints through complaint registers. However, the students claimed that it was exactly what they have been doing. The complaint registers, when considered, had unattended entries confirming the claims.",
      "The meeting ended on this note. The conclusions of it and the actions taken by the hall administration are still awaited."

      "It started with a recent issue wherein three students from Hall 8 were given eviction notices allegedly for having a verbal spat with the warden in a hall level GBM. The warden demanded unconditional apologies from the students. While two students gave an unconditional apology, one student was asked to vacate the hall because the mail sent by him challenged the argument given by the wardens. A similar past incident from Hall 11, wherein the HEC alleges that the Warden In Charge revoked the mailing rights of student members and disregarded the mandate of the same, was brought into the light.",
      "The Student Executives collectively claimed that although as per the institute ordinances, the Warden-in-Charge of the concerned hall of residence has the power to reprimand /impose fine or take any other such suitable measure against any resident of the hall, who violates either the rules and regulations or the Code of Conduct pertaining to the concerned hall of residence, no documents clearly state that the warden can evict a resident, in cases like those of Hall 8.",
      "",
      "They highlighted some “fundamental” flaws in the Hall Management policy of the institute like the non-implementation of Hall Constitutions. They pointed out that although some halls do have a constitution, they have not been ratified by the Academic Senate, while other halls simply don’t have one. To ensure better management, they proposed the idea of a Model Constitution currently in discussion at the Council of Students for Hostel Affairs (CoSHA) to be itemised and approved by the Academic Senate. All halls will be required to submit a constitution within a reasonable timeline, with the Model Constitution as the basis.",
      "",
      "One of the key issues that were raised was the lack of involvement of HEC in the appointment of Warden In Charge, wherein the current system involves appointment by the Director, on the recommendation of DOSA that is discussed with the Associate Dean Hostel Affairs (ADHA), with no real involvement of HEC. To ensure a better connect between HEC and Hall Administration, it was proposed that as a policy, HEC members could recommend three names with an order of preference to the Dean, Students’ Affairs which will be discussed in a committee and forwarded to the Director. Lack of proper redressal mechanism for disputes between hall members and wardens was also raised.",
      "One particular matter related to accommodation of MS by Research (MSR) students was also highlighted. The duration of the stay of MSR students is not defined, but the hall administration treats them as extended students after a duration of 2-years. These students are not provided with proper accommodation, and they cannot even present their case to anyone because the warden has supreme authority over the issue. It was pointed out that these are some loopholes in the system which really need to be looked into.",
      "The GBM also highlighted the problems with the general demeanour, attitude, and actions of the Associate Dean of Students’ Affairs. The student representatives claimed to have experienced a structural exclusion from the system on multiple fronts which warns of a scary shift in the administration’s outlook towards students’ say on campus issues. Unavailability in his office and on other media, unreasonable demands and unprofessional demeaning comments towards certain students have served as major hindrances in the communication of the Associate Dean Student Affairs (ADSA), with the students. In an executive dissent, the Festival Coordinators of the three festivals along with all the  Gymkhana executives raised issues regarding delays in the approval of a lot of permissions and MoUs in this tedious bureaucratic process, exclusion from strangely timed Gymkhana Festival Advisory Committee (GFAC) meetings and the changes proposed in handling festival finances.",
      "Another important issue that was discussed was the disregard of the resolutions passed by the Students’ Senate. A recent office order barred students previously punished by the SSAC (Senate Student Affairs Committee) to hold any positions of responsibility in the Students’ Gymkhana in the future. The executives expressed dissent over this order and felt that this deprives the students who have redeemed themselves from the probation period from gaining essential co-curricular learning and is detrimental for mental well-being as well. As the provision of disciplinary probation with the clause of disallowing students to hold any position of responsibility is already in place, they feel that SSAC should reserve the discretion to award appropriate action on a case to case basis. Additionally, the Students’ Senate feels that a modification to the SSAC manual without being approved by the Academic Senate violates due procedure and undermines the authority of the Academic Senate as the highest decision-making body within the institute.",
      "Student’s Gymkhana plans on starting a public signature campaign to convey these issues and garner public support, and then take them to the Director’s Office. They also plan on re-conducting a GBM, this time preferably with the Director present, to give him a better perspective on these problems. The next step would be planned based on his overall response to the issues.",
      "To make democracy work, we must be a nation of participants, not simply observers. IITK has had a rich legacy of active students’ participation in various fields throughout the years. This GBM attempted to draw upon that legacy and unite the students in order to solve the issues prevailing in the campus. Only time would tell whether this GBM succeeded in doing so."

      "IIT-K is one of the most prestigious institutes in the country. It has an excellent academic reputation, several unique facilities for research and world-class faculty. It has a vast alumni network and close to 100% placements are reported every year. And yet, it is a matter of concern that in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings of 2020, IIT-K was ranked 9thamong Indian universities, behind other IITs like IIT-B, IIT-D, IIT-M, IIT-KGP and institutes such as IISC Bangalore, BITS-Pilani, University of Mumbai and University of Delhi.",
      "The QS Graduate Employability Rankings have been designed to compare universities around the world in terms of the future prospects and career options they offer to their graduate students. They are a metric to help compare the employability of graduating students. While QS rankings for Indian institutes have always been under the scanner, they are one of the strongest metrics available out there, especially when it comes to global reputation.",
      "[infogram id=”dashboard-red-1hke60epv70w45r?live”]",
      "How Are The Rankings Calculated?",
      "The rankings are computed on the basis of a score that is assigned to each university on the basis of certain parameters. These parameters include Employer Reputation, Alumni Outcomes, Partnerships with Employers Per Faculty, Employer/Student Connections and Graduate Employment Rate. These indicators have different weights towards calculating the final score of the university.",
      "1.Employer Reputation (30%): This indicator is based on the QS Employer Survey which asks over 45000 employers to identify which institute’s graduates they find to be most competent and resourceful.",
      "2.Alumni Outcomes (25%): This metric analyses which universities have produced various high achievers in different fields.",
      "3.Partnerships with Employer Per Faculty (25%): This indicator assesses which institutes are collaborating with global companies around the world to produce impactful and pioneering research. It also looks at the placement related partnerships of institutes.",
      "4.Employer Student Connections (10%): It assesses the active presence of companies in the form of career fairs, career presentations in the university over a period of twelve months.",
      "5.Graduate Employment Rate (10%): It estimates the proportion of graduates who are able to obtain employment within twelve months of leaving the institute excluding the students who pursue further studies.",
      "What does the SPO think?",
      "Vox interviewed the SPO Chairman, Prof Kantesh Balani, to know about their views on the issue. According to him, ‘The QS Graduate Employability Rankings are a global index. Most probably, we fall behind in the Employer Reputation parameter due to the lack of international offers received by IIT-K students, unlike IIT-B and IIT-D students.‘",
      "IIT Kanpur was ranked 5th in Employer Reputation, behind IIT-B, IIT-D, IIT M, University of Delhi and IIT KGP respectively, implying that we scored the worst among all the IITs that made it into top 10. The Chairman’s responded to this by saying that there have been no reports that claim that students lack technical acumen, ‘However, it is true that a few years back we received reports saying students are comparatively less prepared for interviews, especially for HR. We have taken steps to improve the situation. The new Career Development Cell has taken many sessions to improve the same.’",
      "IIT-K has the lowest score among the top five IITs in the Alumni Reputation Metric suggesting that IIT-K has statistically failed to produce high achieving alumni in recent years. Commenting on this situation, he admitted that IIT-K has produced lesser startups than other IITs. However, facilities like Deferred Placements and Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre are working in this direction. He believes that research at IIT-K is at par with international standards. However, more publicity needs to be given to change the recent negative perceptions about IIT-K.",
      "He remarked that being at the top for many years, the need to publicize research output never felt necessary. ‘But when we started sliding downwards, we realized that consistent efforts are needed to redeem the public perception of IIT-K, especially in India.’He stressed on the fact that the reputation outside India was still intact, and improvements are only required within India.",
      "",
      "Are they really reliable?",
      "Like any global ranking system, QS also has its shortcomings. One can easily notice the missing cells in the data provided. For IIT Kanpur, only Alumni Outcomes and Employer Reputation have real values. While all the other cells stand blank. Similarly, only IIT M scores a perfect 100 in the Graduate Employment rate while other institutes don’t have any data against them. QS argues that it only gives numerical data for top 400 performers in a given indicator, and avoids releasing the values for the rest. Although they account for the real numbers while calculating the rankings, but a lack of transparency does exist.",
      "Also, Alumni Outcomes is an indicator that gives undue advantages to Universities over IITs as the former have a large diverse multi-disciplinary student base, as compared to IITs where most of the students major in engineering. For example, Alumni excellence in non-technical fields like psychology or philosophy is easily achievable for universities like DU and the University of Mumbai. With that said, credible or not, they are one of the largest ranking databases in the world, and underperformance in these rankings does hurt the reputation of IIT Kanpur as an institute, and the right moves to tackle this are expected from both administration and students.",
      "Poor Rankings and not being conferred as an Institute of Eminence (IoE), have garnered a lot of attention from the IIT Kanpur community. This is only one of the many articles we plan to release on our reputation, outreach, and related effects, so stay tuned.",

      "Incubation, one among the many buzzwords that you might have heard in conversation with your “Entrepreneurially-motivated” friend. But as one transcends those casual conversations, you’ll get to know that incubation is an essential phase in every startup’s journey.Startup Incubation & Innovation Centre (SIIC) isa launchpad for purpose-driven entrepreneurs at IIT Kanpur. It provides Incubation facilities to students and Entrepreneurs in the diverse technological areas of Healthcare, Agri-Tech, Med-Tech, Robotics, Geoinformatics, Artificial Intelligence, and Social Entrepreneurship. Not just this, SIIC is a one-point contact for all matters related to incubation, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and commercialization at IIT Kanpur.",
      "",
      "SIIC was set up in collaboration with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to foster innovation, research, and entrepreneurial activities in technology-related areas. SIIC’s success is evident from the fact that so far 100+ startups are a part of their portfolio, of which around 60 have graduated. Also, around INR 100+ Crores have been invested in various ventures.",
      "There are many inspiring incubation stories at SIIC. Vox got in touch with a couple of these startups. The first one,Doorastha Analytics, is based out of Delhi and is focussed on mitigating the obstacle of sustainability in the Solar Off-Grid Systems. They have developed and prototyped a solution named iLUMY (Intelligent Laghu Urja Mapan Yantra) for measurement and monitoring of Solar Micro & Mini-grids.",
      "The founder of the startup,Mr. Atanu Mukerjeeshares his story with us,“Starting by working in the solar space and rural areas, we realized that there was a shortage of access and availability of electricity for productive purposes. We realized that most of the available solutions were CSR driven. They die out once the financer loses their focus. That is when we thought of coming up with a self-sustainable solution that not only provides electricity to the beneficiary but at the same time creates employment for 2-3 people on site. Our focus was on optimizing the operation cost. At the same time, we sought to employ data analytics to maximize the ROI for each plant.",
      "",
      "Our journey preceding contact with SIIC has been eventful. Before SIIC, we were incubated atVillgro, who is the implementation partner for the INVENT Program. Through them, we came in contact with SIIC in November 2018 when we were selected for funding and incubation support through the social incubation program, INVENT, at SIIC. The experience with SIIC has been very promising and positive. We’ve had excellent insights from the people they have networked us with. The impact and the network we have been connected to has been positive.",
      "The experience with an incubation center primarily depends on the people running it. We’ve worked with quite a few now. The very first one being government-run was very bureaucratic. More things happened on paper as compared to the impact. We even had trouble with selecting a Mentor.With SIIC, first off, we had a very great experience with our Mentor for the INVENT Program, Mr. Rishi Srivastava. He is very incisive with his views and helps us take a solid look at how we are doing. He is critical with his analysis, and he is very well connected. All this put together goes to show that it ultimately boils down to how things are run, and we’ve had a great experience with SIIC. A lot of activities are continually happening even though we are based out of Delhi. Apart from the overall funding and networking with potential investors, SIIC, through its team of portfolio managers helped to provide us with publicity and visibility in various forums and portals.We are currently looking forward to the CIVIC Tech: India 2019 for which we have been shortlisted.”",
      "“CIVIC Tech: India 2019” event was kicked off by SIIC, in collaboration withVillage CapitalandOmidyar Network, on 26th June this year. This program aimed to improve government service delivery and to increase citizen engagement for better governance.In this event, SIIC had shortlisted startups from its portfolio, among which Doorastha was one. The winners of this event will get 1:1 mentorship with sector leaders, and tailored engagements with strategic partners and investors. Participating ventures had to evaluate each other using Village Capital’s unique peer-due diligence methodology, and Village Capital explored the potential of investing in peer-selected ventures from the bunch. Omidyar Network too took the top enterprises from the program to an advanced stage for further support and potential investment.",
      "The other startup we contacted is one closer to home.Campus Haatis an online social commerce platform for college students in India founded by our alumMr. Guddu Kumar, Y10 CSE. At the time of his graduation, he felt a need for a Peer-2-Peer platform where students can freely trade (buy-sell-rent-donate) among themselves. He says, “We started with a website (www.campushaat.com), in December 2015. The traffic began to grow, and the overall response was positive. Until this point, there was no plan to expand Campus Haat into other colleges or make revenue. Things changed after a stint with Dawaibox, Mumbai (Co-founded by Vibhav Agarwal, Y10, IIT Kanpur) where I gainedconfidence and exposure to the startup atmosphere. At this time Akshat Srivastava (Y13, CHM, IIT Kanpur), who was in the final year at IIT Kanpur joined the team as a Co-Founder. After deciding to startup, we started looking for guidance and help. That’s when we got to know about SIIC through my friend Nikhil Kurele who also has his company, Nocca Robotics, incubated at SIIC. Upon contacting SIIC, we were suggested to go for theNIDHI-EIRfellowship scheme, which helps aspiring entrepreneurs to get some funds every month for one year. We already knew that SIIC gave entrepreneurs a coworking space, but we came to know that they also offered residential space, which was unique to them among all Incubators in India. But the process was unknown to most of the students at that time, including us.",
      "",
      "We got incredible support from the SIIC team, right from framing the idea and getting the right business plan to help in pitching efficiently. We were awarded maximum support assistance in EIR, and thus we planned for getting incubated here at SIIC. The Incubation process was reasonably seamless comprising only of a presentation in front of the Incubation Committee which had members from the Innovation Council of IIT Kanpur, some faculty members, some successful alumni entrepreneurs, and private investors. The only thing other than the presentation was a background check on the founders.",
      "We have applied for the HDFC CSR grant under the Community empowerment category and are waiting for the results. After successfully testing our Idea and solutions, we are ready to open our portal for the students in other colleges and are hopeful for the future.”",
      "The Smart Start-up Meet 2019 withHDFC Bankwas organized by SIIC to give a fresh perspective on the current Fin-tech and Banking needs of the country. The event welcomed a lot of new ideas for discussion. Greater importance was given to the opportunities with mass level disruption. HDFC Bank partnered with SIIC to explore opportunities to fund startups in selected areas of Sustainable development, Community empowerment, Clean/renewable energy. SIIC regularly organizes networking and pitching sessions for the entrepreneurs on the campus. Very recently, we had the Medical Technology Hackathon (22nd May to 25th May), and the Smart startUp Meet 2019 was conducted on 28th May. A lot of opportunities are also being presented through their various Venture Capitalists, Industry and Government connect.",
      "Apart from the prospects of Incubation for all Entrepreneurs and the various events conducted by the SIIC, a set of student-centric schemes have been very recently added to the cohort of opportunities available for IITK students.",

      "Not to forget, there’s also theDeferred Placement Program (DPP).",
      "SIIC boasts a highly professional team working with a committee of reputed investors of India who take the call on incubation of any business idea. Thus, an offer of incubation at SIIC is a unique stamp of approval for any business idea.",
      "Summing up with a crunchy stat cookie: ~65% of IITK graduates who got incubated at SIIC succeeded in establishing an independent enterprise. Also, for all the Bio-Tech entrepreneurs out there, the applications forBIGwith a grant-in-aid of 5 million is open now. What’s more to say? #gopitch",

    "title": "Review: Merger of Cultural Council and Films & Media Council",

      "–",
      "The Media and Cultural Council as we now know it was born out of a merger between the Cultural Council and the Films and Media Council, nearly 2 years ago on a trial basis. The decision was taken by the Students’ Senate on recommendations of the GRC (Gymkhana Review Committee) back in the winter semester of 2016-17. As the second semester of the year 2018-19 kicked in, a review of this trial merger was long due. A report finding the merger satisfactory was submitted by the Merger Review Committee constituted by The Students’ Senate. The senate thus decided to continue with this merger. So, what were the reasons and ideology behind the merger? How did the merger affect the Gymkhana in the first place? Vox brings to you a detailed analysis of the merger, its ideologies, effects and what lies in the future.",
      "One of the key arguments that supported the merger of the two councils back in March 2017 was that a common council will assist in collaborative activities. A merged council would, in the words of the GRC, “widen their(the councils’) reach as well as broaden the horizon of learning for all general body members. Ultimately, this will lead to a holistic environment with fresh enthusiasm for the Gymkhana as a whole.”",
      "Vedant Goenka (Chairperson, Students’ Senate, 2016-17) mentioned that content creators are present in the Cultural Council while content publishers are present in the Films and Media Council. Ashutosh Ranka (President, Students’ Gymkhana, 2016-17) supported his point by stating that collaborations between clubs might produce a gem. The reasons stated for this increase in collaborations were twofold, firstly increased ease of resource sharing and secondly a decrease in conflicts of interest fostered by a sense of belonging to the same council. Moreover, a significant fraction of student representatives around the time of the merger, considered that the two councils and their administration were not too different and that a single merged entity might lead to improved efficiency and accountability. The above mentioned arguments coupled with the growing belief that the gymkhana needed to change to adapt to the transforming interests and needs of the student community led to the decision of merging the 2 councils on a trial run till the end of 2018-19/I semester.",
      "While the reasons stated do seem rational and exciting, nonetheless, the “spike” in the number of collaborations that was anticipated following the merger has not been actualized. Swapnil Kumar (the first General Secretary of the Media and Cultural Council, 2017-18) believed it was due to lack of clarity in the mission or goals of the merged council that had to be accomplished at the ground level.",
      "A particular and sole example of successful collaboration is that of ELS and Films Club which led to the initiation of Open Mics on campus. Though it is believed that the role of the Films Club was limited to sharing of resources with ELS, while everything else was from the side of ELS. This surely cannot be the sort of “gem” from collaborations that the pro-merger people had anticipated. At the same time,  ELS Coordinator Karan Jha agreed that though the resource sharing within the clubs has eased out, yet any magnificent utilization of this ease has not happened. Nishant Shukla, former Photography Club Coordinator expressed his concern regarding the large number of clubs that are a part of the Media and Cultural Council – “Ambitious initiatives coming from any of the 14 clubs would find it very difficult to get implemented under the leadership of an overburdened GenSec. Montage Film Festival, an event organized by FMC was scrapped.  A “New Movie Screening” project that was ideated as well as approved was never implemented. Photography Club Exhibitions that used to be held two times every year, were also scrapped for similar reasons.”",
      "",
      "A centralised publicity wing is another one of the more subtle advantages that the Merger was supposed to incur. One of the suggestions to achieve this was to merge the Facebook Pages of the two councils. With the expectation that “The new page will have a greater reach than the currently existing pages of the separate councils”, as quoted in the GRC report. But, with the majority of the audience of both the original pages being essentially the same, the outcome expected was inadequately envisioned. Also, no significant developments have been made to establish a robust publicity wing. Swapnil Kumar shared with us what he realized during his tenure- “All the media and cultural clubs have a particular way of working that they have gotten used to over time. While in cultural clubs there is minimum involvement of the GenSec, the GenSec has a lot more say in the planning and working of the FMC clubs.” It is broadly observed that the films and media clubs are still evolving and need proper guidance from a fourth yearite, and thus are more dependent on their GenSec. On the other hand, the Cultural Council GenSec has more administrative duties. It is contrary to the belief that ‘General Secretary, Films and Media’ and ‘General Secretary, Cultural Affairs’ dispense similar duties.",
      "Various concerns were raised, the gravest of them being the possibility that Films and Media may lose its identity as a separate art form. Rhythm Pathak, The coordinator, Film’s Club said that, “Since people are less acquainted with the activities associated with the FMC (since school times), FMC required an incubation period when it was in infancy (first half of this decade). FMC was undermined by criticism while it was still struggling to grow.” Regarding the point about collaborations Rhythm added that, “collaborations are a necessity for FMC they will have to happen in the presence or absence of a merger so the point regarding collaborations in favor of merger seems redundant.”",
      "The merger unarguably has been one of the biggest changes to the structure of the Gymkhana in recent times. The people who have a pro-merger stance may say that the merger needs to be given more time, that one and a half year were not enough for the positive effects to pan out. But what is supposed to change over the course of, say another one and a half year? The on-ground goals and expectations from the merger should be clearly defined. The need of proper mentorship to evolve FMC clubs should be acknowledged and hence relevant structural changes in the core team of the Media and Cultural Council should be made. And maybe then we can get the ‘gem’ that we dreamt of 2 years ago.",

      "Disclaimer: The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general.",
      "IITK had to wait for 49 years to clinch it’s first Inter-IIT General Championship when history took a turn, and we claimed the trophy in 2013 at IIT Guwahati, followed by two more championship wins in 2014 and 2016 (The 2015 edition was called off due to incessant rain and subsequent flooding in Chennai). We fulfilled our motto of #3BaarLagataar, and our grip over General Championship increased year after year with the rising victory margin every time. From nowhere in the competition before, we rocketed to such dazzling performances in 4-5 years which made everyone wonder what conspired in this span to make IITK the best amongst the equals?",
      "Our success was based on the investment of time and energy of the sports enthusiasts, Directors and Deans, numerous other faculty members, gymkhana, coaching staff and of course, the participants. We raced ahead of other IITs as we went forward with full-time coaching staffs for all the sports disciplines and the investment in the development of the sports culture based on love for the sport, hard work, desire to achieve paid off with desirable results.",
      "In 52nd Inter IIT Sports Meet at IIT Madras, 2017, we started our campaign as hot favourites, but as the tournament progressed, our victory chariot was checked, with an end to our winning streak. A little introspection did go into the failure, but no major, organised attempt to scrutinise the shortcomings was made. The few defeats that we faced were close enough to make many believe that our loss may be a fluke and we will rise stronger in 2018. However, that was not the case, and in contrast to our expectations, we were handed a thrashing in Guwahati. The results were as miserable as they could be, and we finished the meet at 6th position in the points tally.",
      "So how come in a narrow span of 2 years our performance fell so miserably? The result is merely a reflection of our wrong decisions of the past, training, culture, and leadership. The defeat has surfaced our flaws in the handling of our human and physical resources, along with showing us the signs of our declining culture. Other institutes caught up with our formula of hiring specialised coaches around 2015-16. Following this similar system, if other institutes are getting ahead of us, the issue raises eyebrows towards competency and dedication of the training system and the lacking innovations and discipline. The coaches employ different mechanisms to hide their flaws, few of which are interfering in the Captain appointment process to select those who would be inclined towards them and assuming a sacrosanct status in the team so that students do not even think to complain.",
      "Moreover, there is a sense of utter disbelief within the sports community regarding the attitude of certain coaches towards their sport. Take, for example, a senior member of the Volleyball team mentions what their coach said to them after losing the quarterfinal match, “Mujhe to pata tha tum log ya to league se bahar ho jaoge. Ya at the max, quarter tak pahunchoge, usse zyada to kya hi jaoge.” This is a sheer disrespect of more than twenty players, who have dedicated long practice hours throughout the year, and is against the spirit of sportsmanship. Most of the members of the Lawn Tennis team mention that the coach is a major cause of their miserable performance, as he never arranged practice matches, never tried to teach them new skills, and in some cases, he didn’t even know their game style. Many members of the team feel that, if the attitude of the coach doesn’t change, they will leave playing lawn tennis.",
      "The story is the same for many other disciplines. Many Table Tennis players have complained regarding the purchase of racquets from the coach, amounting up to as large as 9000 INR per racquet, with some of them have never received the racquets after making the payment. Majority of the Hockey team members feel that, despite dedicating lots of time, they were incompetent at the platform of Inter IIT as they were never taught the skills that other teams possessed, and due to the stunted skill development, players are distancing themselves from the sport.",
      "A sportsperson at IITK dedicates an average of 2-3 hours per day training under the guidance of the coaches. After spending 4-5 years, a student gets out of the campus, having learnt a little. The PE 101 and PE 102 courses, which were designed keeping in mind the importance of physical education in the overall development of a student,  are reducing to an attendance taking exercise. Inter-IIT performance is what the coaches have reduced their job to, and despite this, we have had dismal performances. Take for example, in Table Tennis, both men’s and women’s team have not been into semi-finals of the past four Inter IITs. Hockey, Volleyball Men, Athletics Women, Lawn Tennis Women have had occasional and highly inconsistent performances. On the other hand, teams like Weightlifting, Cricket, Athletics Men, and Water Polo have excelled on most occasions. When we generalise these team’s success over a few championships, we see direct indicators of the various coaches’ competence, work ethics, and attitude towards sports.",
      "These are some of the long lists of incidents, which do not point towards a healthy sporting environment. And it isn’t just the Inter IIT players who are infuriated. When the GNS Council received a review regarding CPA through online sources, it reflected unpleasant trends. Beginners, who just want to learn a particular sport, in most cases, expressed that they had been given zero to negligible attention. Alumni have voiced their dissent towards the downward slide and their emails to the Director and other relevant authorities raise our eyebrows and points towards issues of incompetency, haphazard work ethics, and financial mismanagement.",
      "Sports can add a unique dimension to each one’s life. With an expenditure of about two crores per annum, and with the availability of world-class infrastructure, we can feed the sporting desires of a much larger community and with a much higher quality of training. But, if we look at the sporting opportunities available to the general community, the situation is nasty. Most of the students seem discontented from the approach of not giving due attention if someone isn’t a probable member of the team. A large gap has been created between sports enthusiasts of the campus and the contingent. Problems like this are profoundly denting the sports culture in our campus.",
      "The lack of accountability and discipline of the coaches is eventually leading to the downfall of the culture which took years to build. The lobbying, internal politics, and non-cooperation amongst coaches of the same sport among many other factors have rendered the deserving and hard working coaches as passive and led to their social sidelining. Under all such circumstances, sports cannot thrive. There is a genuine fear that if we do not arrest the slide, we may end up being even worse than we were a decade ago. Virtues like discipline, teamwork, belongingness, which sports instil in a person are going to be underdeveloped if the will to win is being compromised, the poor results are going to be reflected in the morale and the personality of the sportspeople of IITK, and the reputation of the institute is going to be corroded in all such sporting competitions.",
      "There is a famous saying, “We cannot become what we want, by remaining what we are”, which is very much applicable to our scenario. The need of the hour is to deeply introspect and scrutinise our mistakes closely and act upon the remedies with immediate effect. We need to be determined to change, we need to step out of our comfort zone and be a bit critical, and if need be, a few harsh proposals need be taken. The administrative will is desirable here to bring about necessary reformative decisions. A few unnecessary elements are infecting the system which need to be permanently washed off without any compromise. If there are some internal issues and politics in the concerned bodies, which are denting the culture, then strong efforts must be made to resolve it.",
      "The team wise results of the past few years suggest certain definite trends, which are indicative of their work ethics, practice environment and most important of all, the competency of the trainer. Targeted remedies for each team should be applied, depending upon the statistics and the reviews. Compulsory Physical Activity, which serves as an introduction to the sports at IIT Kanpur, has to be reviewed and sincere efforts need to be made to transform it into a better platform to nurture young talents. We must also look forward to spreading sports to a wider community of students at the campus. Many a time, it has been found that students who are willing to learn a particular sport, just for the sake of learning are not provided with due attention. Incorporating them as a part of the sports community on the campus is very much desirable.",
      "Student leadership also has a vital role to play in the course of bringing about these changes. Gymkhana events like Josh, Inferno, Enthusia, Urja etc. must be structured to provide a pathway of giving the talented a path to the teams. The contingent leaders must envision, plan, and coordinate to reinforce disciplined and planned practice schedules are followed along with the induction of significant innovations being adapted to our situations. The team captains and senior members must be pivotal in preparing the next generation of sportspeople, enlarge their team family and create a culture wherein fellow teammates continue their sport out of passion. From top administration to the novices who are willing to learn the game, everyone has a shared responsibility, and we must play our part in consonance with the goal,  with utmost sincerity for the community which we are proudly a part of, even if it takes to be a bit critical of ourselves.",

      "The past few weeks have been very busy for the Senate Undergraduate Committee (SUGC) Convenor, all because of a serious error in the campus automation platform, Pingala, which allowed four Y17 students, despite having one fail backlog (E/F or X) in some of the IC (Institute Compulsory) first-year courses, a branch change in their preferred departments. It is clearly stated in the UG manual that, “A student may apply after her/his second semester if she/he has acquired credits (i.e., received a passing grade) for all the courses prescribed in the templates for the first year of the program, including the courses where S/X grades are awarded”, yet these students were allowed a change of branch.",
      "The issue was brought to light after a student who got a branch change due to this loophole reported the same to the Dean of Academic Affairs (DoAA). Later a review of the academic records of the four students confirmed the allegations. The four students had one fail backlog in the first year courses (as prescribed in the course template).",
      "The issue was tabled for discussion in the Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC) where a number of solutions were proposed and discussed over the course of two meetings. To further supplement the committee, additional information was collected between the meetings. An important fact that emerged from the collected information was that even if every student who applied for branch change and had at most one fail backlog course was considered for branch change, it would not change the branch change results. But it is important to note here, that this fact still does not make this case fair.",
      "",
      "Three solutions were proposed in the meetings.",
      "Solution 1:",
      "To allow the students to continue in their new branches for the rest of the program. This shall be a one-time exception and shall not be used as a precedent for future decisions.",
      "Solution 2a:",
      "Revoke the branch change and allow the students to change their registration in the current semester according to their original department.",
      "Solution 2b:",
      "Revoke the branch change and allow the students to continue in their original branches starting from the third semester. The courses undertaken in the present semester but not part of the template of the original branch would be considered as Open Electives.",
      "Solution 3:",
      "To allow the students to continue in the new branch and everyone who has a CPI greater than those of the applicants and had up to 1 backlog or failed course in the first year be allowed to switch their branches. This should be done using supernumerary seats if required, but not at the cost of the strength of the initial branch going below 55%. (which is also a rule imposed by the UG Manual).",
      "The student body is not privy to the detailed discussion of the meetings, except for the (as of now, five) student representatives. Still, the issues with the solutions proposed above are clear and can be opined upon. While the first solution clearly involves the least amount of hassle, it is visibly unfair to the others with similar academic record (one fail backlog – E/F or X) who didn’t apply for branch change as they knew (or expected) that they would not be eligible for the same.",
      "The second and third solutions do have a semblance of fairness for all concerned but it will be a logistical hassle both for the students and the corresponding departments, especially with regard to planning the upcoming semesters (although one might argue, it is a feasible adjustment as it will be merely akin to a third semester branch change which is routinely facilitated by IITK).",
      "While three out of the four Y17 students here are partly at fault for hiding information after being granted branch change in violation of the rules of the UG manual, the Pingala automation portal clearly needs to be more robust as such errors, minor though they may seem, can potentially have drastic effects on the lives of individual students.",

      "A great turmoil has been felt in the washerman community residing in the campus since the last week. The Estate Office, IIT Kanpur drafted an order that mandated the vacating of the Dhobi Ghat by the end of April. In response to this, the washermen are seeking the support of the campus community. They displayed the order and also a letter addressed to the students and the other campus denizens which translates to the following :",
      "On 28th March, we received a notice of eviction from the estate officer (Manoj Kumar) to vacate our houses within 30 days. The notice says that since the leases for our residences were in the name of our fathers who have since passed away, those leases are now invalid, and hence we are living here illegally. Newspaper reports have even been released which claim that we are living here illegally, do not perform the washing duties we are supposed to and indulge in criminal activities like peddling drugs. We are extremely hurt and confused by these false allegations. None of us has ever given any customer any cause for complaint, both in terms of service and integrity. We all pay our bills punctually and regularly – be it the rent, water bills or electricity bills. Our families have been living here since Director Kelkar’s time, and many of us know no other profession except for this. In fact, rather than the regular dhobis not doing the work they are supposed to, most of us even have our wives and children helping us with work. If we are forcibly removed from this institute, most of us will be unable to support ourselves and our families, especially those over the age of 45. We have heard that the reason for the eviction is that the institute wants to build a new hall or guest house on our land. We have no problems with this; however, all we humbly ask for is that we are relocated to some other place in the institute so that our livelihoods are saved and we can continue to provide the services we have been for generations. There is more than enough land available for this, and it would not cost much either. Hence, we have written an application to the director with this request, and are requesting the signatures of the students and faculty who avail our services for support. This is not the first time we have been threatened like this. The last time this happened, it was only with the students’ and the faculty’s help that we were able to get justice. They convinced the administration that we perform an irreplaceable service, and hence we should not be evicted in this inhuman way. We hope the campus community will support us again as they consistently have in the past.",
      "This is not the first time that their residential rights in the campus have been questioned. The last time this happened they managed to extend their stay with help of the students, faculty members and rest of the community.",
      "What is the matter?",
      "In its early days, IIT Kanpur opened a lot of new job opportunities as the residents needed access to basic services and amenities so far away from the city. As a result, a few people were given the permit to start their business as washermen. These people were also provided with some small residential quarters. Now more than 50 years later, only a few, if any, of them, are around. This means that their successors who are continuing with the business have not been given any permission for the same which implies that they are exercising an illegal stay in the campus.",
      "This, however, doesn’t seem to be the only problem. According to the concerned authorities, these washermen are also expanding their businesses to places outside of the campus. This, according to them, goes against the ethics of work. The administration refrained from taking any actions, up until now, as the number of people requiring their services has come down or will come down owing to the installation of washing machines for the general use.",
      "The other reason for the action is the need of another hostel to relieve the space crunch. The ever-increasing number of PhD students and research engineers and a prospect of a remarkable increase in the number of girls had made an immediate action quite imperative.",
      "All these factors led to the eviction order that came out in the last week of March and gave the washermen a time of one month to evict the premises so that it can be cleared and a new residential hall can be built instead.",
      "“Understanding that there are families living in that area and it will be tough to find another place all by themselves, the campus administration has discussed it with the city administration to help find a shelter for all these families, and is also willing to provide any kind of help they would therefore need”, said Prof Manindra Agrawal. “We plan to employ a few of them to continue their service for students who prefer washerman over washing machines. They will be allowed to live in the halls,” he added.",
      "The campus community needs to come forward to help find further solutions to this problem which are acceptable to everyone alike and is in the welfare of this institute as a whole.The washermen will be gathering on 4th April, at 5:30 PM in the Ramleela ground to discuss the issue with the rest of the community. It’s time we make our contribution in solving the problems of our community and help it reach new heights and set new examples like it always has.",

      "On the night of 4th February (Sunday), around forty students from Hall 12 seeked medical assistance in the institute health centre (HC) complaining of stomach ache and vomiting. The physician on duty, Dr. Devendra Kumar attended to these students overnight. This number grew to over 250 by Monday evening. Dr. Kumar said that all of the students that came to HC on Sunday night were in a condition where they should have been admitted but due to constrained resources, he only admitted three to four students whose condition was most severe. The others were kept under watch for a while, given rehydration and were sent back with medicines. Some students also complained of loose motions, a symptom that appears at a later stage in gastritis (the primary diagnosis) which suggested that the condition had progressed much before the students came to HC. This was corroborated by accounts of some students who had been complaining of vomiting since Saturday afternoon.",
      "“Gastritis is mostly caused due to bacterial infection which is found most commonly in milk and meat products gone bad or due to unhygienic kitchen practices. Since not all the students consumed meat, it is most probably due to milk” said Dr. Kumar. He speculated that it might have been caused due to milk that was allowed to stand in the open for too long, wet flour that was not cooked immediately or unclean utensils.",
      "The mess manager too believes that the poisoning was caused by milk since on Sunday evening, when tea was being prepared for the mess workers, it curdled. But he does not think that the spoilage could have happened due to negligence of the mess staff since milk is boiled as soon as it arrives from the vendor in the morning and all precautions are taken to ensure that it is fit for consumption. The warden-in-charge, Prof. Anshu Gaur cited another reason that raises suspicion over milk. The vendor who supplied milk to the mess for drinking, did so at around Rs. 30 per litre as opposed to Rs. 40 to the canteen. No incident has been reported from the canteen in the three years that they have been using milk from that particular vendor. Moreover, if this is compared to the packaged milk price of Rs. 54, it is hard to believe that it was pure milk that was being supplied.",
      "A case of foul play is suspected by the mess manager in this incident. The mess empanelment (tendering for mess operator) for the Hall 12 mess was due on Tuesday and he believes that a particular mess worker was in favour of another mess to replace the current one. He reckons that it might be the case that the worker tried to derail their chances of winning the tender for the mess by orchestrating this episode. The said worker was reported to have been on uninformed leave since Monday and was unreachable till Wednesday when this interview with the manager was held.",
      "Samples of the food served on Sunday were taken but could not be analysed since a laboratory for this purpose was not found. As food samples remain useful only till 72 hours after being cooked, they had to be discarded. Monday onwards, the mess stopped receiving milk from the two vendors that supplied it. Only packaged milk from Amul and Mother Dairy was used for a few days. Only recently was one of the vendors who supplied milk for purposes other than drinking was reinstated. This decision was based on the fact that since the milk from the other vendor had curdled the tea, it was unsafe to take milk from him. Since it is easier to spot adulteration in milk when it is processed to make paneer or khoya, loose milk was considered safe for these purposes.",
      "To prevent such incidents from happening in the future, various steps have been taken by the hall administration. From now onwards, food samples of each meal are taken and refrigerated. This way, if a case similar to this one is reported, it would be easier to investigate the cause. Moreover, Prof. Gaur believes that it acts as a deterrent against unsafe practices of mess workers since they would be fearful of being caught with this system in place. Also, it has been proposed to install a CCTV camera in the mess to keep a check on the mess workers and the protocol followed while handling food.",
      "Some students of Hall 12 reported not having had any milk products since Saturday afternoon and yet experienced symptoms of gastritis. This raises questions about the hygiene standards maintained inside the Hall 12 mess. We were informed by Prof. Gaur that measures like covering of head with shower caps and gloves while serving food are in place but their implementation is entrusted upon the mess manager and kitchen supervisor. A new initiative of installing a wash basin inside the kitchen has been proposed. It is hoped that for every worker who enters the mess, it would be possible for the supervisor to oversee washing of hands but this again is contingent upon the conviction of the manager and supervisor. The hall guardians make regular checks of the hygiene standards in the mess but the personal hygiene is not scrutinised. Until they workers exhibit visible symptoms of an illness, no action is taken. This is the case in most of the other messes across our campus too, where personal hygiene is not as strictly enforced as it probably should.",
      "Even though it seems unlikely that the real cause of the incident will come to light in the absence of evidence, we must use this incident as a wakeup call to implement stricter standards of food safety.",

      "More than a thousand students sat for placements this year and77%of them (undergraduate and graduate) got placed in the first phase. This means that 4 in every 5 people got a job. This figure is higher than sister IITs with65%students being placed in IIT Bombay, whereas IIT Delhi and IIT Madras had figures of60%and62%respectively.",

      "IIT Kanpur trumped it’s sister IITs in terms of average pay too. The average package among undergraduates was close to the 20 lakh mark while being 15.8 lakh overall. The same being 13 lakhs at IIT Bombay which is traditionally considered the one having the best placement record among IITs. For international offers, this figure was a whopping 81.59 lakhs in IIT Kanpur.",
      "Apart from the volume of packages received, the offered pay has been a standout as well. More than half of the campus got a 7 digit package. Putting it in perspective, in 2016 only 22% of IIT Bombay students got 13LPA+ packages (which is along the lines of the packages this year too, as quoted by Times of Indiahere)",

      "A deeper analysis of the statistics reveals just why IIT Kanpur has led the placement season in all aspects. A sector-wise distribution of the number of students placed shows that IIT Kanpur has been the major beneficiary of the boom in the tech sector. About200students were placed in their core sectors, while42in Research and Development as compared to150and23last year respectively. This bears testimony to the fact that IIT Kanpur carries an excellent reputation in the core engineering sector.",

This shows the amount of freedom one has with respect to the academic flexibility. On the other hand, with a masters programme being a focused 2-year program saw more than half the students being picked by top core engineering companies.",
      "This rise placement can be attributed to a wide variety of reasons. It appears that this year, the students were much more prepared for the placements at IIT Kanpur that before with special sessions from Prepleaf, a start-up itself founded by IIT Kanpur alumni. There is no doubt in the fact that the incessant efforts put in by the placement team form the major part of the reason behind this spectacular performance.",

      "In the wake of the suspension of twenty two students for involvement in a case of ragging, the national media was flooded with articles about this incident. It was unfortunate to see how the primary sources of information for the nation were misrepresenting facts and trying to sensationalise the issue. The article published byHindustan Timeson 10th October is one such example which is replete with incorrect details. Here are a few excerpts from the article where facts were misrepresented :",
      "“The ragging was recorded on cell phones and circulated on social media groups.”",
      "“In addition, the president and other office bearers of the student gymkhana were removed from their respective posts allegedly for ignoring the complaints.”",
      "“About 30 junior students filed a complaint to the dean of student affairs against 50 seniors, saying they were thrashed, abused, and forced to do inhuman acts on August 20.”",
      "“Action against the senior students was expedited only after one of the professors at the institute wrote about the incident on his blog.”",
      "As the campus media body, we feel it is our duty to set the record straight and report the events correctly. Here are some some questions whose answers might lift the shroud off of the facts. The answers have been pieced together based on discussions with the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA), Prof. P Shunmugaraj and student nominees to the Senate Student’s Advisory Committee (SSAC). They represent the views of the SSAC and the Academic Senate as collective decision making bodies and not of any particular individual.",
      "Q. What were the sequence of events that led to the action being taken against the students?",
      "A. On the night of 20th August, the ‘baap wing’ was organised in Hall 2 where freshmen were required to spend the night with the second year students who resided in their wings the previous year. The next day, the DoSA met the student Hall Executive Committee (HEC) members and enquired about the incident. They denied knowledge of the incident but over the next few days the DoSA received complaints about the incident. He requested the students who were forced to participate in the ‘baap wing’ to write testimonies detailing the events and identifying the seniors. This information was taken to the SSAC and the committee proposed the suspension of 22 students which included the members of the HEC and other students who were on the scene. When these recommendations were taken to the Academic Senate on 21st September, it directed the SSAC to allow the accused students to present their side of the story and subsequently propose punishments. The said students were asked to appear before the SSAC on 2nd October and a one year suspension was proposed for six students and termination for sixteen others. On presenting this recommendation to the Academic Senate on 3rd October, the termination sentence was reduced to a three year suspension.",
      "Q. What were the nature of the complaints?",
      "A. The first complaint the DoSA received was from a freshman over mail. In it, he protested against things like vulgar language, rude behaviour, restrictions on clothing, etc. which the seniors were responsible for. He was unhappy about the interaction with seniors on the night of the Treasure Hunt (an annual activity for freshers where they have to complete a scavenger hunt which might require them to go to senior students for help). Based on accounts from a friend, he also mentioned the occurrence of the ‘baap wing’ and the interaction of students with the President, Students’ Gymkhana and an alumnus (who was working on a startup being incubated in campus). The DoSA also received complaints specifically appealing against the ‘baap wing’ subsequently.",
      "Q. What was the action taken against the President and the alumnus? Why were they punished?",
      "A. There was a complaint against the President of a verbal exchange between a freshman and him, which the SSAC believed was tantamount to abuse of power and hence he was asked to resign from his post. The alumni was accused of indulging in ragging on the night of 14th August during the treasure hunt and was barred from seeking residence in the campus for the future.",
      "Q. How were the students identified? Was it solely based on the written complaints? If not, what other proofs assisted the investigation?",
      "A. The identification was based solely on the complaints and testimonies of the aggrieved students. The complainants were asked to identify the senior students and all the students whose names they were able to come up with were considered guilty. The members of the HEC were also included in the list of guilty students because it was believed that they were complicit in organising the baap wing and did not make any effort to prevent it from happening. The HEC was also penalised for denying knowledge of the ‘baap wing’ when the DoSA visited them (along with Gymkhana office bearers and other faculty members).",
      "Q. How was a distinction made between the students who were awarded varying durations of suspension?",
      "A. The accused students were interviewed by the SSAC and based on their understanding of the degrees of involvement, they were awarded different punishments. The students who were awarded a lenient sentence were present on the scene for a very short period of time. They either joined the proceedings late or left early.",
      "Q. Why were the students not called the first time around? Wasn’t that against the procedure of investigation?",
      "A. It is standard procedure for SSAC to invite the student(s) against whom a complaint is lodged. A copy of the complaint is also handed to the student and a chance is given to defend oneself. In this particular case, the SSAC felt that protecting the identity of the complainants was of paramount importance. If the accused students were invited to the SSAC, they would have been able to make the connection between the complaints and complainants. When the Academic Senate mandated that the students be given a chance to present their side of the story, measure were taken to ensure that there was no physical interaction between the two parties. The students were escorted from the campus gate and were required to leave the campus soon after the interview was done. Even when they came to collect their belongings after the sentence was formally announced, they were given specific time windows to do so.",
      "Q. Why was no action taken against other people responsible like warden?",
      "A. The warden(s) intimated the DoSA about the instances of ragging going on in the halls and requested him to take action. Thus, the committee did not have reason to believe that they were turning a blind eye or were not motivated to stop this menace.",
      "Q. If the investigation reveals more names, what will be the future course of action?",
      "A. The interrogation of the punished students did reveal more names and the same has been communicated to the Academic Senate. The decision rests with the Senate whether to take action against the students or not.",
      "Incidents like these are very sensitive and the dignity of many students is at stake. It is highly irresponsible for national media to publish incorrect information to grab eyeballs. While the importance of taking information to the masses in undeniable, it should be done carefully. We hope that media outlets take more care in the future while handling incidents of this nature.",

      "On 31st August, a postgraduate student at IIT Kanpur told the Students’ Senate about her horrific experience with the Institute security. She alleged being threatened and verbally abused by Mr. Sandeep Shivare, the Security Officer (SO) at IIT.",
      "This is not an isolated incident. The meeting of the Senate was the culmination of a series of incidents and revelations regarding security overreach at the campus, which left the campus community appalled, and concerned about their own safety, freedom, and security.",
      "The first domino was flipped on the evening of 30th August, when an Open House meet had been scheduled by a group of faculty and students to discuss the issues relating to the firing of Visitor Hostel (VH) staff. Vaibhav Vaish, an alumnus, and winner of the Director’s Gold Medal in 2004, was initially denied entry by the SiS (Institute security) guards because he did not have an ID card.",
      "He was allowed to attend the meeting after faculty members intervened.",
      "During the meeting, it came to be known that a student had been apprehended by the SiS guards on the previous night and taken to the security control room, while he was putting up posters for the open house. The reason: the student did not have permission for putting up posters—something that is unheard of in the Institute.",
      "After the meet, the attendees found more than a dozen SiS guards, along with members of the Uttar Pradesh police waiting for them. Mr. Vaish was asked to step aside, apparently for security-related questioning. A video emerged the next morning, depicting an altercation between security members, and faculty and students. It became clear that the Institute’s Security had been “given” sweeping powers to enforce security measures as they saw fit by Dr. Deepu Philip, professor and chairman of Security Advisory and Executive Committee.",
      "A special meeting of the Senate was then scheduled for the 31st August, where increasing interference from security on campus was one of the agenda items.",
      "New, shocking revelations came up during this meet.",
      "A final year undergraduate student recounted his experience. One summer night, he was in the OAT, watching an Indo-Pak cricket match with his friends. While leaving the venue, he was asked to produce his ID card. He did not have it with him. He was misbehaved with, and taken to the SiS control room for questioning. In the SiS control room, Dr. Philip appeared again. The student was threatened that he would be charged with sections 151 (which relates to unlawful assembly and disturbance of public peace) and 153 (which relates to rioting) of the Indian Penal Code. He was then asked to write a statement, and then to modify his original words, as it showed the security officials in a negative light. Already having suffered hours of mental agony, he relented, wrote a statement more aligned to what they wanted, and was let go.",
      "An M.Tech student in the Dept. of Aerospace Engineering also shared her experience in the Senate. Her problem began when she noticed a man loitering on the 2nd floor of GH-2. To discover the identity of the individual, she went to the gate to look at the entry register. She was told that it was Mr. Shivhare, the security officer and that he was not mandated to make any entry in the hall registers. The guard did check the register though, and there was an entry made under the name of “S.K.S”. Having seen the entry, she assumed the matter was sorted. Twenty minutes later, a lady guard knocked on her door and told her Mr. Shivhare wanted to talk to her. In spite of her assurances that the matter was sorted, Mr. Shivare launched into a tirade. Mr. Shivhare continued by saying that the entry register washisproperty since he was the security in charge of the campus and that she had no right to view the contents of the register. About half an hour later, she was summoned to meet an officer downstairs. There, she found an officer in khaki uniform, two SiS guards, and Mr. Shivhare’s relative, waiting for her. The relative started accusing her of trying to intrude into her personal life. The officer present noted down her roll number, and other such details, and let her go.",
      "The Deputy Director subsequently sent out an email to all on 1st September, saying that security personnel will be trained and briefed appropriately. The email also mentioned that the Chairman, SAEC (Prof. Phillip) had offered his resignation from the post. Even though a local news report suggests that the resignation has been rejected, there has been no official communication in this regard.",

      "The 1st Emergency Meeting of the Students’ Senate, 2017-18 was held on 3rd September, 2017 to take cognizance of a recent mass disciplinary action taken against students, in response to a complaint against ragging filed by some Y17 students. On 2nd September 2017, the Senate Students’ Affairs Committee (SSAC), decided to take punitive action over 100 students, and punishments included all possible actions in the purview of the SSAC. The student nominees of SSAC couldn’t divulge more information because they were bound to maintain confidentiality of the proceedings of the committee, until the order is communicated to the students involved.",

      "The Students’ Senate has drafted a resolution to be sent to the Director highlighting the issues mentioned above and has also requested the Director to constitute a Special Disciplinary Committee to investigate the matter in an unbiased and fair manner. The resolution can be found at the following link : https://goo.gl/a2SoXD",
      "The Senate expressed its deep discontentment against the procedure undertaken by the committee in taking action against the students. The Students’ Senate noted that the SSAC acted in violation of the democratic foundations and values this institute has been built on. It acts as an evidence of the autocratic approach taken by the SSAC as it completely undermines the authority and power of the Students’ Senate, and thus the students.",

      "A silent solidarity march was taken out at 5:30 PM on 24th August 2017 in campus to protest against the dismissal of 72 workers (out of strength of 74) of the Visitors’ Hostel (VH). We decided to explore the matter in more depth and conversed with the Deputy Director, Prof. Manindra Agrawal.",
      "As is known to everybody by now, the change of contract of the VH is the reason behind the layoff. The primary bone of contention between the two sides is the rationale behind the change and subsequent layoff of workers. While the protesting students and faculty believe that the services rendered by the workers have been consistently good, Prof. Agrawal informed us that the administration has received several complaints regarding the low quality of services and moreover, many workers have been found indulging in activities that were unbecoming of them. On asking for further details into these ‘activities’, Prof. Agrawal preferred not to divulge those details on a public platform. Thus, the motivation behind the change in tender was primarily based on quality of services.",
      "To improve the services of the VH following the complaints, a committee was formed which decided to float a tender for the VH. Like every tender floated by the institute, open bids were invited and anybody was eligible to apply. In addition to the process followed, a team visited the facilities of the bidders to ensure that the services were up to the mark. The contract was finally awarded to Sarovar Hotels.",
      "The agitators believe that even if the contractor had to be changed, there were no valid grounds for laying off the workers. The contractor could have started operations while retaining the old workers and the institute should have taken measures to ensure this. Prof. Agrawal believes that since the process of restarting services in the VH had been delayed, the contractor brought experienced workers with him to get things up and running as soon as possible. This in turn meant that most of the current workers would be unemployed starting 1st September, when the contractor is supposed to take charge. In parallel the contractor planned to conduct interviews which would continue for a certain period and the decision to retain workers would be made subsequently. This uncertainty of employment raised concerns among the community and in turn the Director instructed Sarovar hotels to speed up the interview process so that the interim period of unemployment can be reduced. But, it was inevitable that certain workers would find themselves without a job even after the process was completed, either due to incompetence or due to requirements of the new contractor. There have been some concerns regarding the interviews conducted by the contractor too, wherein the concerned community members believe workers were asked irrelevant questions which in no way could be used to decide their future employment. Prof. Agrawal informed us that those were informal interactions that the contractor decided to hold because he was visiting the campus and had some time on his hands. The formal interviews have commenced and a decision would be take based on these interactions.",
      "To mitigate this problem of unemployment, the institute decided to train the laid off workers, at its own expense, in skills that would help them find employment elsewhere. The administration has also highlighted a favourable situation for the workers in the establishment of new messes where they may be able to find employment. The advantage is that working in hostel messes is not as demanding as lending services to the VH, so it is likely that even if they are unable to meet the standards of the VH, they would be accepted in the new environment.",
      "The reason why the institute authorities are not willing to force the hand of the contractor into retaining the workers is quality of service. According to Prof. Agrawal, the administration does not want to give the contractor a reason to not deliver good quality services, which he would get if forced to work with the old staff. Cancellation of the contract, he believes would not be a possibility as it was done via proper procedure and there are no grounds to cancel it. As for the transparency of the tendering process, the institute already has a well defined, public procedure, he says.",
      "An additional concern that has been raised is with regard to the contracts of the hall messes which are to be renewed soon. Concerned members of the community believe that there might be a possibility of hundreds of mess workers losing their jobs since a precedence is being set by the VH incident. Also, the argument of quality of service may be applied in the messes too and new deluxe restaurants might be given contracts. This introduces the possibility of old workers being fired for not meeting the quality criteria. To confirm these concerns we contacted Pratyush Rai, CoSHA convener. He negates this fear of firing off mess workers, as a deluxe restaurant can’t get the contract for the hostel messes as it will have a direct impact on the BDMR. Secondly, small and medium size contractors will have to pay for the relocation of the workers, which is not a sound idea considering the fact that mess establishment charge is also administered. Hence they will prefer to retain the existing mess workers. Pratyush further added that the mess workers are aware of their rights and the administration ensures that they receive the minimum wages. So, the concern about the job security of the mess workers is unfounded.",
      "With each passing day, more concerns are being raised and there are still many unanswered questions in this debate. We will keep the readers updated about the proceedings.",

      "Last year the Government of India released NIRF (National Institute Ranking Framework) rankings, claiming it to be a step towards improving the Indian higher education ecosystem. It collected the data within a couple of months and released the first edition of “India Rankings” on April 1, 2016. Being the inaugural version, the ranking did have some issues, however, on closer examination of the parameters, it was found that ranking parameters were very reasonable.",
      "The data used for the rankings has been supplied by the institutions themselves, but has not been verified by NIRF itself. However, NIRF mandates that institutions display the data submitted to the NIRF on their website. To desist the institutions from reporting erroneous data, they plan to randomly cross check their submitted data, though it has not happened yet for the inaugural ranking.",
      "Overall, IITK ranks 5th among the other IITs. Some notable parameters for IITK are Teaching Learning and Resources (student strength, faculty size, faculty experience), where it has a whopping 10 points less than that of IITKgp and behind other IITs as well. In fact, it ranks 16th in India in this category, below institutions like National Institute of Technology, Meghalaya. On the other hand, IITK tops the rankings in Graduation Outcomes (placements, higher studies, and entrepreneurship among graduates).",
      "It was mentioned that IIT Kanpur performed poorly in research domain of the QS ranking previously. However,  IITK ranks well in NIRF ranking in terms of the Research and Professional practice (quality of research and publications in short), coming in at 3rd overall.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "But when a closer look is taken at these numbers, a picture similar to the QS ranking emerges. In terms of the quality of research output, IITK again lags behind in terms of the number of citations (similar to that in QS) as well as a number of papers (contrary to QS where IITK was at the top). As for the number of patents, IITK performs competitively to IITD and IITKgp but still is a long way behind IITB and IITM.",
      "Another major issue is the number of faculty members, that can clearly be seen when compared to other IITs. Due to this reason, IITK has a much lower total teaching experience in years. This has arguably the greatest impact on our rank with this parameter having 30 % weight. It also has an effect on the number of PG students. Compared to around 2500 PG students enrolled at IITK in 2016, the corresponding figures at IITB, IITD, and IITM are around 6000, 4000 and 4200 respectively. A lesser number of PG students hurt IITK’s ranking since NIRF has a separate weightage for the number of doctoral students. Lesser Ph.D. students also means lesser research output and this might be the reason for us lagging in the QS ranking in the research parameter.",
      "",
      "Coming to consultancy projects, it was found that IITK significantly lags behind IITB, IITD and IITM. These three IITs have consistently outperformed IITK the in amount of money received from consultancy projects year after year. Similarly, IITK again lags in the amount received from sponsored projects with IITB leading the pack. The three-year average (2013-2015) for the sponsored projects at IITK stands at around 68 crores compared to 205 crores for IITB, 106 crores for IITD, 115 crores for IITM and 67 crores for IITKgp. Even if we adjust the projects for the number of faculty members, we still lag behind IITB, IITD and IITM, with IITK having sponsored projects per year per faculty worth Rs 1.7 million, as compared to 1.9 million for IITD, 3.7 million for IITB and 2.1 million for IITM.",
      "",
      "",
      "Graduation outcome(based mainly upon placement, higher studies and mean salary) brings some much needed respite, as IITK tops the scorecard. Though the figures suggest that IITK exhibits mediocre performance in average placement strength (4th in 5) and average salary (5th).The silver lining here is the significant improvement in the average salary of IITK, with the institution reporting an average salary of 1.1 million in 2014 as compared to 1.0 million for IITD, 0.89 million for IITB,1.1 million for IITM and 1.2 million for IITKgp for the same year. The figure below represents the corresponding data averaged over three years.",
      "",
      "Outreach and inclusivity areyet another parameter in which IITK fails to create an impact. The diversity factor, after spoiling the faculty analysis scorecard (in QS), haunts it in the student category too. As mentioned in the last part, IITK has quite a low proportion of PG and Ph.D.  students as compared to UGs among both males and females. The sex-ratio, however, remains poor in all the IITs with IITM and IITD having a slight edge over the others.",
      "",
      "This brings us to some final conclusions that our analysis leads to. First of all, even though there is a large variation in the citations reported in the three year period (which might be due to erroneous data collection), a negative trend is still evident in the research indicators and an introspection is necessary. Secondly, IITK has not been very successful in attracting students to its PG programs. That IITB has around 2.5 times more PG students than IITK is astonishing. This reflects poorly in our research output. To improve our academic and research output, we should prioritize strengthening the total faculty strength as well as our Ph.D. and Masters intake. Another pressing matter is to increase our industrial collaboration as the amount received from sponsored research and consultancy projects is quite low (around half) compared to IITB and IITD.",
      "Even if we assume that the data is accurate, it can be seen at places that rankings, be it NIRF or QS, have their limitations. This may be due to erroneous data or not-so-perfect methodology or due to the inherent subjectivity. However, rankings do tell us a bigger picture of the overall situation. It is in this spirit that these rankings should be interpreted. Rankings are increasingly starting to shape the perception of the universities. Like it or not, the trend seems to be here to stay. So, we should try to improve our performance in the segments we are lagging. Whether we are successful in improving our rankings or not, we certainly will become a better institution in the process.",

      "The General Elections for the year 2017 concluded last week. A rather dull and controversial election season saw the Election Commission take up various new initiatives in an endeavour to have a greater reach among the campusfraternity.",
      "One of the major highlights of this year’s elections was the idea of conducting executive dialogue and debates via Facebook live. Ayush Pathak, the Chief Election Officer (CEO), 2016-17 said, “The live streaming of the debates and dialogue fetched a good viewership with an average Facebook reach of over 4,500.”",
      "Though the idea of Executive Dialogue was quite successful, campaigning on Facebook using video manifestos drew flak, particularly related to font size and content arrangement. In response, the CEO said, “The implementation of the idea by the candidates was mediocre. We advised them many times but still various mistakes were committed by the candidates because the idea was the first of its kind. But it still garnered a great response from campus community as well as alumni. I believe it will definitely be successful in days to come.”",
      "This year for the first time, a card free voting system was organised. However, according to the EC, the success rate was about 70% due to data not being available with the Office Automation system.",
      "Major changes in the Code of Conduct included a decrease in the fine amount and a change in the pattern of the SoP Box. Till now, cross questioning was not entertained, neither from the panel nor from the public. This time, the SoP Box had a lot of cross questioning, which ensured that ambiguities of any sort were clarified.",
      "Another significant change was an increase in the campaigning period from 5 days (all working days) to 7 days (including two holidays). This was a big relief for the candidates as they could comfortably space out and plan campaigning in hostels.",
      "A few ideas from the pre-conduction report, however, were not implemented by the EC. One of them was releasing posters in all halls informing people about the functioning of the senate. The CEO said, “It wasn’t implemented as planned but the collaboration with TedX, IIT Kanpur team made the posters more amusing. A number of online posters were also released. An interesting display of posters was implemented on the polling booths notifying the voters about NOTA and General Elections.”",
      "There was a conspicuous increase in activity of the Election Commission with many new initiatives. However, all efforts were marred by a very dull election season. There was a significant decrease of nominations as compared to last year for various Senator positions due to which elections were conducted only for Senator, BT/BS Y16 and MSc (2yr)/ MSc-PhD Y16.",
      "A more severe issue, however, are reports of a major decline in the voter’s turnout. The exact details shall be revealed in the next Senate meeting. This is definitely a major point of concern both for the Students’ Gymkhana and for the entire campus community.",

      "Rankings have always been a matter of major discussions and debates. They have become a reference point for students while choosing an institute for their higher studies, but just a prima facie view of these rankings can be tremendously misleading. With a large amount of data available online, making sense out of it is far from an easy task, even more so for a prospective student.",
      "To delve deeper into the ranking methodologies, two rankings: the Quadrelli Simmons or QS Rankings and the Indian Government initiative, the NIRF rankings were analyzed by Vox and the curious insights derived. The first part of it, derived from the QS rankings is presented here.",
      "QS Ranking system consists of various different rankings, the most prominent ones of which are theWorld University Rankings,Graduate Employability Rankings,University Rankings by RegionandWorld University Rankings by Faculty.",
      "",
      "First  look at the World University Rankings and the mere numbers paint a truly grim picture. None of the IITs come in the top 100 or even the top 150. IITD, the best of the IITs comes in at 185 with a score of 48.6/100 whereas IITK ranks at 302 scoring just 36.7/100.",
      "The most notable thing is the score of IITs in the faculty-student Ratio and International students and faculty.",
      "",
      "Comparing IITs with National University of Singapore (NUS), the top Asian University it can clearly be seen that the ratio of international students and faculty for NUS is much higher than all the IITs, with more than half of the NUS faculty being from abroad. These parameters have a separate weight age of 5% each in world rankings.",
      "Similarly IITs have less than half the Faculty-Student ratio as that of NUS. This parameter having 10% weight-age in the world rankings.",
      "Another point to note is that thequalityof papers of IITD is much better than any other IIT with 93.2/100 in CPP, whereas IITK performing moderately at 64.2. The score of IITB was much lower at 48.5, more on this later.",
      "In the Asian Rankings, a somewhat different picture is seen. IITB tops all the other IITs, coming in at 35, scoring 76 points out of 100, whereas IITK ranks 48 scoring 68.1 points.",
      "",
      "[The score of NUS is 100 in all parameters except Papers per faculty (Edit)]",
      "The most surprising thing is that IITB tops this ranking even when IITD tops the world university rankings with quite a large margin, owing to the fact that these rankings have a different weight ages than the world rankings.",
      "Another thing evident from the above graph is that in addition to the quantity of papers published, the quality of papers is also extremely important. NUS lags way behind in terms of the number of papers (60.1/100) in contrast to IITs, which average 94.5 between them but NUS has 100/100 in terms of Citation per Papaer, whereas IITs do poorly on this parameter.",
      "Here we also see an queer thing in the rankings, IITK ranks below IITB in terms of citations per papers whereas the contrary was true in the World Rankings.",
      "IITs have a favourable employer reputation which is echoed by the fact that IITians occupy several high posts worldwide in both industry and academia.",
      "IITs are engineering institutes for a fact with much lower emphasis on arts and medicine and this is a major cause for IITs suffering in terms of ranks. This means that the reality is not as bad as it might seem in terms of rankings. As a matter of fact, all top 5 IITs rank under 150 in core engineering topics, with most departments ranking in top 100. This can be seen when we take a more subject wise perspective.",
      "",
      "As it can be seen above, IITK does not fare too well when compared to the IITs in most subjects. Although one standout is Mathematics, lagging behind only IITB in terms of the overall score.",
      "",
      "The better quality of papers was the deciding factor with IITK bagging the highest score in H Index Citations and the second best in Citations Per Paper from amongst the IITs.Now at the other end of the spectrum, Civil Engineering department lags behind the other IITs with the lowest score in Citations per paper as well as H-Index citations.",
      "",
      "Having a look at the renowned and pioneering CSE Department of IITK, we see a similar story as in Civil Engineering Department. It is tied on the overall score with IITKgp at 4th position.",
      "",
      "Arguably the best performing field for indian institutes, Electrical Engineering department  of all the top 5 IITs and the IISc ranked in the top 100. EE department of IITK has a competitive score in the category of Employer Reputation and H-Index Citations, which wasn’t the case in other disciplines, but is again ranked lower than other IITs due to the a poor score in Citations Per Paper which is also the least of all Indian institutes.",
      "",
      "IITK’s standing  can be summarised by the following two graphs, they highlight the fact that we lack in terms of quality of papers in almost all the subjects except for Department of Maths and Chemistry, which translates into a better rank for these departments.",
      "The above problem is also evident in the faculty rankings.The faculty rankings of 2015 revolve",
      "chiefly around academic reputation of the faculty members, their reputation in the eyes of the employers and the quantitative estimation of the quality of the their research papers, which is further split into two: Citations per Paper and H-Index Citations.",
      "As is evident from the above chart, the main reason for IITK’s poor score , vis-a-vis the other IITs , are the Employer Reputation and the H-Index Citation. The sole reason IITB pulls ahead of IITD is also theH-Index Citation, with a whopping 9.1 point difference.",
      "On an aside, we also looked at subjects like economics and arts but IITs were nowhere in site, other than IITB that surprisingly stood in top 100 in arts and designs. Similarly IITs do very poorly in biological fields, with IITB and IITD being the only ranked IITs coming in the range of 300-400",
      "",
      "The subject wise rankings data show that IITs suffer a lot in terms of world ranks due to lower scores in subjects like business, management, art and design. This leads to the most striking revelation of all: the average scores (ascalculated using all UG courses except BSBE which comes under Biological Sciences  in QS and Economics) and those of the world rankings have a wide gap in between them as shown below.",
      "",
      "What is even more surprising is that the same is not true for all universities, Consider the scores in Academic Reputation for University of Science and Technology (China), ranked at 104 in QS World Ranking . It is 64.1 on average on the subjects offered by it and 63.1 in the World Rankings. Similar is true for the other IITs and many institutes, which dampens the credibility of the World Rankings.",

      "Day 5 was the happy homecoming the Kanpur contingent was waiting for. Besides grabbing the top two positions in Pole Vault and the second spot in 1500m, we also won the 4X100m Men’s relay against all odds.",
      "In men’s 4x100m relay, we were up against Delhi who had in their ranks, Dileep Pudi, the Meet Record holder for 100, 200 and 400m events. Mohit gave us the steady start we needed before Waghela and Jorwal built the lead. Pranav finished off the race with a brilliant run as we pulled one over Delhi.",

      "Pole Vault was our most assured performance in an athletics event yet. We were miles ahead of our competitors and both our participants broke the previous meet record of 3.35m. Anurag achieved a height of 3.60m without breaking a sweat and Sagar finished at 3.40m.",
      "Badminton",
      "In an exciting match which won the hearts of everyone present on court, Kanpur won 3-2 to win gold. The first singles match was held between Rohit of Kanpur and Srinivi of Madras. Srinivi was in full control of first set till score was 20-14. After this Rohit went on rampage to take the scores to 20-20, but after this lost it 21-23. Rohit avenged the first set defeat by winning the next two sets 21-11 and 21-13. The second singles was held between Gopichand of Kanpur and Soham of Madras.

Even after this no team was ready to give points and the score went to 22 each. But after this some classic shots from Gopichand stole the match from Madras and they won it 24-22 and hence gold for Kanpur. The level of competitiveness can be judged from the fact that normally a match generally lasts 2 hours whereas this lasted more than 4. Almost every match was decided in last set and in some cases, even till the last point.",
      "After the impressive show of the men’s team now was the turn for the women’s team to add to the tally. The first singles match was a face off among the top seeds of their contingent. The former Inter-IIT gold medallist, Priya started off on shaky grounds as her rival won points effortlessly in the first set though her injury posed a serious threat to the continuation of the game. Priya looked wobbly, her game lacking the lustre of a titleholder though her opponent played with aggression and pulled through some brilliant smashes and forehand and backhand lobs to take the first set 21-18. The second set wasn’t any better for Kanpur as Kalyani took a 7 point lead halfway while Priya was trying to get her rhythm back. Post break, she did manage to reduce the lead bringing the score to 13-15 but Kalyani’s skills were unmatched as she went on to win the match 2-0.",
      "Next up was the doubles match. The Bombay duo of Kalyani and Payal overcame the advantage taken by Kanpur at mid break with some sharp drops and net play winning the set.

The Bombay team took the title winning both the sets 21-14, 21-12.",

This quarter saw three 3 pointers, two by homegirl Sonal and one by Delhi girl Mallika. The next quarter saw a superior game by Kanpur. The girls played in cohesion and put up a strong defense which forced a lot of errors out of Delhi. Kanpur’s Chanchala played an aggressive game, intercepting the ball in defense and cutting through the Delhi defense and scoring in offence. Kanpur’s Avani also chimed in causing a few turnovers and making some excellent passes. Kasturi did a good job at being the centre, taking up rebounds and shooting with accuracy. Two baskets by Kasturi along with two 3 pointers by Sonal again in this quarter helped Kanpur close the quarter at 30-23. Delhi closed the gap in the third quarter, by scoring 15 points and conceding just 8. Delhi’s Apoorva brought the situation under control by scoring three timely baskets which included one 3 pointer.

      "The much awaited final of the religion of the nation was played at the ACES ground. Delhi won the toss and chose to bat first. The Delhi openers gave the team a steady start, as they had been for the tournament till date with their star batsmen, Moolchand, scoring 29 runs. The first fall of wicket for Delhi was when they were at 34 runs. The turning point of the match was when Vikrant from Kanpur scalped both Kumar Sahaj and Moolchand. Neeraj Meena was the highest scorer for the away team and overall with a score of 31 runs. At the end of 18 overs, Delhi had reached 102 runs. The 19 over, bowled by Nitin Sharma was a beauty, giving only 2 runs. Finally the target set by Delhi for Kanpur was 110 runs. Nicku Nitish and Vikrant, came in to bat but Kanpur lost Vikrant in the first over itself. After this shaky start, Nicku and Sanchit stabilised the innings with a 50 run partnership. After losing Nicku, Vaibhav Yadav, who scored a blazing 54 against Delhi when they faced each other the last time, came in. The match was safely in Kanpur’s hands at the end of the 16th over when they needed 18 runs of 24 balls. But then, Amit Meena’s run out and the unexpected loss of Nikhil Srivastava made it interesting. Finally, a four by Vaibhav saved the day and brought home the Gold for Kanpur.",

      "The stage was set for the semifinals and Madras was Kanpur’s opponent. The match started with Madras edging ahead in the first few minutes but producing no clear cut opportunities. Kanpur hit back after that period with a free kick taken by Manish that resulted in a header similar to the last match. After that Kanpur started dominating the play, as Deepanker sent an excellent through ball for Saurav which he crossed and the goalkeeper somehow cleared. It went as far as Debojit who attempted an exquisite back heel shot but the keeper made a superb reflex save to parry it away.",
      "Kanpur had their best chance when Deepanker’s shot somehow reached Debojit leaving him one on one with the goalkeeper 5 yards away from the goal but he shot it straight at the goalkeeper. The first half finished at 0-0 (thankfully for Madras), with Kanpur missing various guilt edged chances.",
      "The second half began on the same note with Kanpur tearing the Madras defense with ease and yet another golden opportunity was created via a through ball of Mishra to Saurav which he tried to chip over the rushing goalkeeper but it was way off target. The rest of the second half continued with Kanpur having the major share of possession but were unable to break in as fatigue weighed in. 50 minutes finished with both teams level, although Kanpur players must have been kicking themselves for missing opportunities to score 3-4 goals. Both halfs of extra time were more of the same, a match between the Kanpur offence and Madras defense and it went to penalties.",
      "Madras reached the penalties with the experience of having faced them in the last knockout match as well. The first 3 were scored by both the teams in clinical fashion but then somewhat similar to Luis Van Haal in Netherlands’ world cup quarter final, Madras coach substituted his goalkeeper. The 4th penalty was saved by the Kanpur goalkeeper as he dived acrobatically to the right corner. Then it all came down to the 5th Kanpur penalty with tremendous pressure on the Madras goalkeeper but he somehow made the save to take it further into sudden death. Kanpur scored 2 penalties under immense pressure and it paid off when the 7th Madras penalty was missed by Adarsh. Kaustubh took the last penalty and converted it emphatically, making the crowd euphoric. Hence leaving Kanpur on the verge of winning the Tournament.",

The second match turned out to be the most exciting one, pitting Mandeep Singh, captain of the Roorkee team, against Abhimanyu Yadav of Kanpur. Abhimanyu won the first, third and the final game but lost the second and the fourth ones as Mandeep exploited Abhimanyu’s lack of concentration as evident from the many unforced errors committed by Abhimanyu.

      "The dignitaries then proceeded to share their thoughts on sports and Mr. Jhajharia and Mr. Bhati shared their specific experiences as olympians. Mr. Devendra Jhajharia recounted his tragic accident which led him to lose his left arm and the dedication which took him from practicing with a homemade wooden javelin to a world record holder in the sport. His journey from district champion in 1996 to world record holder in the 2004 Athens Paralympic Games was a continuous journey towards excellence. But the highlight of his career has been breaking his own record in the recently concluded 2016 Rio Olympics. He praised sports as a discipline for inculcating the values of unity and will power. He remarked jokingly that seeing the trophy on display on the podium, he felt like competing with the IITians right away. He implored all IITians to take inspiration from his story and to keep the service of the nation as their primary goal.",
      "To conclude the programme, the Enthrall group, a professional acrobatics group ‘enthralled’ us with their gravity defying stunts. The audience watched in awe as they performed flips and jumps with no props or safety nets.",

      "The second day of cricket matches was as exciting, if not more with the same venues hosting seven matches today.",
      "Ropar beat Jodhpur by 28 runs. Sumit high scored for Ropar with a useful 39, helping them reach the total of 136/10. Jayant’s heroics for Jodhpur went in vain as they fell short at 108/6 runs despite his unbeaten 47. Akshay was the leading wicket-taker of the match, taking 4 wickets.",
      "BHU slaughtered Hyderabad, beating them by a whopping 62 runs. Prashant scored a quickfire 37 as BHU reached 132/3. Hyderabad found themselves lagging at 70/6 by the end of the stipulated overs. Yash was the most economical bowler, giving just 9 runs in 4 overs.",

      "Kanpur defeated Guwahati in an all-round show. First they restricted Guwahati to 89/8, then they chased it down in just 16 overs. Vaibhav starred for Kanpur, taking 4 wickets and enforcing a run-out. Nicku Nitish provided the stability the run chase needed by scoring 42 in 41 balls. Guwahati batsmen could not take off after getting their eye in, costing them dearly.",
      "Roorkee hammered Bhubaneshwar, holding them to just 70. Palash was crucial for Roorkee, getting early breakthroughs and leaving them reeling. He finished with a 5 wicket haul. Roorkee openers ensured that there was no drama whatsoever by chasing the target down themselves in just 10 overs.",
      "Madras defeated Bombay by 37 runs in an all-round team effort. Shubham and Saurabh chipped in with cameos while Gyan Prakash scored a quickfire 26 near the end, taking the total to 127. In reply, Bombay could manage just 90 in the 15 allotted overs. Shreyas emerged as a bowler, taking 2 for 12.",
      "The encounter between Kharagpur and Gandhinagar was a closely fought one. KGP edged past in the final over, beating them by 4 wickets. Gandhinagar scored 127, with the top four, all chipping in with useful contributions. Kaushal scored a match-winning 33 down the order and Ayush and Sachin both took 2 wickets apiece for KGP.",
      "Delhi beat Patna comprehensively by 59 runs. Sagar scored the only half century of the day as Delhi reached 122/6 in 15 overs. Patna looked clueless against the Delhi attack; folding for 63/9. Aditya and Rohan both took 2 wickets for Delhi as they emerged victorious.",

      "Prof. Shukla explained, “As a cyber security researcher I advised the CC that the passwords must be changed every six months as long standing passwords often lead to compromised accounts. For example, if a key logger is installed on some public terminal and someone connects to their webmail on that computer, the password is compromised. A stolen password can allow a criminal to get into the CC system, and then try various compromising acts.”",
      "In most institutes it is mandatory to change the passwords at least twice a year. The system itself prompts users as soon as the six month period ends, and does not allow the user to login until he/she changes his/her password.",
      "He also mentioned that the CC may implement such a system in next few months and users will have to change their password at least twice a year which would have to be distinct from the last three passwords. Since such an automated system is not in place, requests are sent to change the password by mail.",

      "One fine day, the mistress of evolution sat seaming in her courtyard. In her tinker-some best, she wondered what today. A fragrant breeze, the rustle of leaves, and that congenial stroke of inspiration, she conceived fever! With a grand flourish of her wand she had the next living moving thing to spike a modest rise in temperature as when any infection took seat. Little did she know then that that little whim would be such a hit in the ages to come. 600 million years have passed since, and the fashion is still in vogue. Come any infection, be it human, animal or plant, the organism spikes fever!",
      "It was in 1st century AD that Celsus, a Roman scholar, despite being surrounded by Roman soldiers who wore sexy skirts and ambled around distracting gentle folks with that display of rippled manly thighs, had the focus of mind to notice beyond and club fever with three other signs, local redness, swelling and pain. These are the four cardinal signs of inflammation, the body’s response to any infection or trauma. With an addition of loss of function as the fifth sign – and the unfortunate restriction of man-skirts to Scotland, the firm association between fever and infection still holds today.",
      "Evolution while a tinkerer, hates to hoard. Each organism is an essential minima. It doesn’t carry as baggage attributes that don’t benefit it in this struggle for existence. Anatomical features, physiological aspects, psychological quirks, all have a meaningful purpose in enabling the organism and the species to reproduce and survive. Enter man and he wonders, if so, then what good does fever do that evolution did not lose it despite the 600 million years of relationship it has had. Well, could it be that the rise in body temperature on infection helps the organism ward off the infecting agent, kill that irksome interfering microbes, be it bacteria, virus, protozoa or fungus?",
      "Julius Wagner-Jauregg, other than having the misfortune of having been a life-long friend of Sigmund Freud, and an anti-Semite, the order of misfortunes with-standing, bagged the Nobel for medicine on 10th December, 1927, a decade right after he treated nine patients with neurosyphilis. Now neurosyphilis is a vintage disease, a relic of pre-antibiotic era, wherein tiny wriggly bacteria called Treponema pallidum pitch camp in one’s brain and go hiking; though this little adventure doesn’t bode well to the patient. There was no treatment to cure or stall this malady. Julius thought better and gave them malaria. Yes, you read that right. He infected them with malaria. Lo and behold, of the nine patients in his first trial in 1917, six got better. No kidding!Julius Wagner was no run-of-the-mill mad scientist who just got lucky. There was a rationale to this radical trial. Malaria causes fever. Many including himself suspected whether this fever, the little whim of our evolutionary seamstress, could have the role in the clearance of infections.And as the story stands today, Shanon S.Evans of Rosewell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo published in Nature Review in July, 2015 that Immune system feels the heat. Fever affects every aspect of the body’s intricate immune defence, and in almost every case, improving its robustness. It’s so useful that lizards, which can’t raise their body temperature (courtesy being cold-blooded), spike it to fever range by behaviourally seeking warm-shelter upon infection. And MJ Kluger found that if you don’t let these lizards do so by artificially restraining them, or giving them aspirin which curiously makes them not seek hot spots (suggesting the mechanism for physiological and behavioural fever induction is the same), the lizards perish to the  infection.",
      "Now if that were the case, why on earth do we have paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen and the  likes prescribed for fever? If fever fights infection, why do we relieve one of fever? Shouldn’t  we let it wage on! But before that, what’s fever? Is any rise in body temperature fever, or  there’s more to the mix? And how does the body rig up this association between infection and  fever?*for answers, and for a little bit about my bathroom, await the continuation, thePART-IIof this long arduous monologue!

      "Dr. Sudhir Jain was the first speaker in the latest lecture series initiated by IIT Kanpur, Making of a University, in which distinguished academicians are invited to share their vision which has been instrumental in the establishment of the eminent educational institutes of India. The lecture was held on 27 November 2014 in the Outreach Auditorium.",
      "For those who do not know, Prof. Jain is a faculty member of the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur. He went on a leave in June 2009, on a journey to set up an academic institution from scratch, serving as the director of IIT Gandhinagar, one of the eight new IITs established in 2011.",
      "Prof. Jain started with the recollection of his golden days at IIT Kanpur, the institute which he joined as a “young boy” of 25 years with hardly any understanding of the real world and of the complexities of life. ‘I grew and learnt there, succeeded in many things while failed in others, where people cheered me up when I did well and supported me when I did not’, quoting his facebook status, prior to the talk.",
      "At the time the new IITs were being set up, Prof. Jain received 4 mails, including one from the then director, Prof.S.G.Dhande, requesting him to submit his resume for the role of director of one of the new IITs. Though disappointed by the decision of setting up of new IITs, at a time when the older ones themselves needed a lot of attention to fix many diverse problems which were preventing our rise to the international scenario, a 5-week introspection led him to the realisation that the older IITs will anyway march ahead, considering that establishment of new IITs is imminent, he thought that leading one will be a really exciting journey.",
      "",
      "950 Students, 88 faculty members, 100 staff members – That is what constitutes the IIT Gandhinagar family. They were allotted a beautiful 400 acre land, on the Sabarmati banks, on July 30, 2012, and in the summer of 2015, they will move to that place from the temporary campus they are currently running in.",
      "Within a few years of inception, IIT GN has incubated three companies, 10-15% of graduates are pursuing a PhD from top US Schools and 3 of them are continuing their education at IIT GN itself, significant of the trust the students have in their institute. Few students have gone ahead and joined TISS, NID, Shrishti and were well encouraged by the institute for the same, as they believe that students should chase their passion. One-third of their students graduated with an international experience, as the institute facilitates the process of grabbing an international research internship (it makes no sense that a student wastes time sending over 2000 mails for an internship). They have filed 7 US, and 1 Indian patent.",
      "“We will train you for your last job, not your first one.”",
      "IIT Gandhinagar hires only the most outstanding candidates of a field as faculties, regardless of the discipline. Endowed with immense freedom, the faculties are provided high support and in return, the institute expects highly from them. The unique disciplinary diversity witnesses a professor of Chemistry teaching a course of Sociology.",
      "",
      "One of the peculiar things about IIT GN is their 5 week foundation programme for the freshmen with an aim to foster creativity, leadership, societal awareness, values, ethics, engagement in sports and physical activities. While majority of Indians did not know about Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Laureate, 2014, the students of IIT GN had interacted with him in the foundation programme. When someone pointed out that the students may lose on the initial curriculum due to the lengthy orientation period, Prof. Jain said, “How does it matter whether I learnt ‘that’ 20 percent portion of a particular course? What matters is whether I learnt life-skills or not in my initial days”",
      "Innovating in the undergraduate curriculum, IIT GN has compulsory courses in Biology, Design & Innovation, World Civilization, along with 8 HSS courses as a requirement of the engineering degree. They have a comprehensive Viva Voce for all students, where in 3 people meet every student once in a semester and talk about their life at the institute, academics and career.",
      "",
      "In his charismatic tone. Dr. Sudhir made it clear, “I want my students to either be entrepreneurs or professors, because that is what contributes back to the society. Working for a multinational company is not what I see them pursuing.” No doubts that 3 companies, namely Grid Ants, Doopica and Tinker Tank have been started by the students of IIT GN",
      "There is zero tolerance for things no one approves of. Academic dishonesty, including proxy attendance, is strictly dealt with. Students have been suspended for a semester for looking into their peers exam copies during the exam. Bullying another student or any kind of financial misconduct is not acceptable.",
      "A distinguished feature of this institute, is that it treats the students as adults, responsible for their well being or otherwise. No grade sheets are sent to home. No restriction on entry to girls or boys hostel for either gender. In short: ‘It is your life. You are welcome to either do wonders out of it or make a mess out of it.",
      "“We will provide you everything you need, but we can’t provide everything you want”",
      "The temporary campus of IIT Gandhinagar has all the facilities for a sustainable lifestyle. The laboratories are collaborative, not differentiating between different ‘sects’ of scholars, a connected campus with a central mess and day-care centres for the infants of the female staff of the campus are some of the unique features of the institute infrastructure.",
      "",
      "Remaining true to the spirit of outreach, IIT Gandhinagar runs NYASA which primarily aims to support and educate the children of the migrant construction workers in and around campus. This humble initiative includes adequate temporary housing equipped with RO water facility and toilet system.",
      "",
      "“We are not in a hurry to be a new IIT. Once old, you are old forever. We are enjoying the fact that we are young.”",
      "Setting up a new organization comes up with challenges, and IIT GN is no exception. There is a mindset of low expectation from all stakeholders, on the grounds that it is a new IIT, and that if it aims to be a world class institute, it is a technical institue in a developing nation. Lack of self esteem in quite a many of undergraduate students, lack of mid-career faculty, alumni body and academic administrators are the other key issues on the chart.",
      "Under the leadership of Dr.Sudhir, IIT GN is marching ahead, ready to face all these challenges. They are aiming for internationalization of the institute, close linkage with the industries and establish a culture of sustained excellence. He rightly summed up the mood of the institute:“IIT GN is not a place for unhappy people”",

      "These are some of the mails sent by the Dean of Student Affairs (DOSA) of IIT- Kanpur to all students’ list in the past month. These days the “lost and found” mails are qualified enough to be termed as spam. As you can see, not even a single mail was read by the student. Many delete these mails straightaway.",
      "There have been cases when a person found something but didn’t know who the owner was. Later a mail titled “found” was circulated to every soul in the campus and still the owner couldn’t be located. Possible reason? The mail wasn’t read by the very person who lost the thing.And the students are not to be blamed. If X lost an object or Y found one, this is not something that the whole campus should be informed of. The indifference towards such mails by the campus junta render the mails useless. Added to this, students tend to ignore even other mails by DOSA which may be pertinent to them.To do away with these exasperating mails, actually help students find their belongings ( and help prompt substance into the mails by DOSA), some motivated students of IIT-K namely – Sohil Bansal, Abhimanyu Jaju and Atulya Shivam Shree have come up with an online- lost and found- portal. The link to the portal is:-http://students.iitk.ac.in/lnf/.",
      "",
      "The website has a lucid interface and aims at providing a handy platform to the people who have either lost or found something. This provides an advantage over the earlier mass-mailing ritual as only the concerned individuals will bother to visit the portal and others would not be troubled. Also, this will reserve webmail for more important information and announcements .Actually, what’s astonishing is why something like this took this long to surface when we all have had “lost and found sections” in our school which made finding lost stuff a hands down experience. But now we at the campus too have a lost and found section. Only, this one has an upper hand, as it is virtual.",
      "So, if you’ve lost or found something, simply post it on the portal. The success of the portal depends on us, the users. Instead of mailing DOSA, asking him to forward your mail and later be read by none, post on the portal so that if someone happens to find your belonging, the person can contact you directly.Such ingenious ideas can greatly simplify life on campus. The Vox team urges you all to make efforts towards identifying problems in and around the campus and come up with innovative solutions. A simple idea of yours might solve a problem that may be pestering a multitude.",
      "We have had examples when extremely simple ideas of some individuals had effectual results. A striking instance is that of the “Gopi Search”. Another example was the introduction of bag tags in library during the last end semester exams. It was a very simple idea that nearly brought down the bag exchanges to zero and also helped the webmail inbox stay clear of the plethora of extremely annoying “exchanged bag” mails.We are the stakeholders of the campus. We the partakers in the benefits as well. Just being aware towards your surroundings and conscious of the happenings can make all the difference. After all, only an aware and conscious student community can create a robust campus.P.S.- Vox sincerely hopes somebody takes up the task of revamping OARS.",

The display of their exuberant talent was coupled with the chanting and hooting of the audience. The theme for the evening was “Eve de Magique”—French for “Evening of Magic”, which encompasses the realms of fantasy, the supernatural, and magical realism, as indicated by the Freshers’ Night coordinators.",
      "The security at the New SAC, the venue of the event, was stricter than usual: 5 security guards were present at the perimeter of the stage to monitor anyone who might attempt to disrupt performances.",
      "The event began 45 minutes later than the scheduled time of 7:30 pm. The DJ night that was to follow was thus deferred to the next day.The attempts of the coordinators to begin the event on time proved fruitless, due to several reasons which, in retrospect could’ve been handled better.",
      "The event began with the lighting of the lamp by Dr. A. R. Harish (DOSA), Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi (DOAA), and Dr. A. K. Ghosh (former DOSA). The DOSA was invited to say a few words, which he did quite literally.This left the crowd chuckling which then responded with cheers of “DOSA ka tempo high hai”.",
      "The lively quartet of English Literary Society compères, despite some setbacks, did a decent job of introducing the performing clubs.The anchoring was in English as well as Hindi, a deviation from the norm for ELS, which usually always used the former. This was well-received by the audience. Also, some of their quirks were hilarious, especially the audible ones.",
      "",
      "The Music Club got the ball rolling.They began with instrumental pieces that captivated the crowd. These included the Game of Thrones and Harry Potter themes, which adhered to the mood of the evening.This was followed by renditions of several English and Hindi songs, including Yellow by the British band Coldplay, and Sinbad the Sailor from the popular Bollywood movie “Rock On”.",
      "After having not performed last year, the Hindi Sahitya Sabha returned with a bang. Theirshayariand witticisms were highly appraised by the crowd, as was evident by the resounding roars and applauses. The quips were about the transition that a fresher goes through in his/her initial days on campus.",
      "The sound system began to malfunction by this point, which, coupled with the crowd’s cacophony, deemed the Dramatics Club performance that followed inaudible and incomprehensible, even to those seated in the first row. Nevertheless, the costumes and the expressions were commendable.",

The audience was left dazed and bedazzled by the panache of the partakers.The ramp-walkers sizzled and sparkled on stage, their charm being accentuated by the use of props, such as frills, sparkles and even a guitar. An act which stood out was a male model who juggled three balls in the air.",
      "The Fine Arts Club gave two performances: sand art and speed art, both of which were remarkably well-received by the crowd. The former talked ofHarry Potter’s three deathly hallows, as the artist rendered the sand into a story. The latter performance saw the freshers drawing what initially seemed like random strokes on canvases, which were later put together beautifully to reveal a huge drawing of Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of the magic schoolHogwartsin theHarry Potterseries.",

The dances had elements of classical and freestyle, among others.They engrossed the audience so much that the crowd stopped its antics during the performance, and couldn’t help but sway to the beat.",
      "A new event, “Mr. and Ms. Fresher”, affiliated with Antaragni was introduced this time. On the basis of forms distributed during the Orientation and subsequent interviews, three boys and three girls were shortlisted for the main event.",

      "The event comprised of two rounds. The participants had to showcase a talent of theirs in the first, and the second was a question-answer round which put them on the spot and tested their repartee.The winner among the boys was Rhic Chowdhury, and among the girls it was a tie between Srishti Jain and Riya Talati.“The winners of this competition will gain a direct entry to the finals of Mridaksh, the hunt for Mr. and Mrs. Antaragni,”said Srijan Shetty, the Head of Competitions and Events for Antaragni’14.",
      "The trademark(albeit somewhat controversial) dance of Hall 2,Bhokal, which the Y13 could not witness during their time, was finally staged. Even though it failed to meet the audience’s heightened expectations, the Hall 2 junta was delighted and proud.",
      "Several videos were interspersed between the events: the Orientation/Freshers’ Practice video (by FMC), which showcased snippets of memories from those times; the Antaragni and Udghosh promotional videos and a montage of freshers’ photographs, wherein they held white-boards to illustrate their answer to the question, “What brings out the crazy in you?” There was also a prize distribution for the winners of the creative writing competition conducted by ELS.",
      "The exit was meticulously planned to avoid any unsolicited incidents (which the freshers were apprehensive of). The seniors were made to exit first, and then the freshers were gathered by the HECs and escorted to their respective halls. Other security measures included ID card checking at the New SAC gate.  Further, the Anti-Ragging Committee and DOSA sir himself were vigilant till late night to ensure a flawless conclusion to the Freshers’ night.",

      "Just like last year’s Antaragni, Techkriti’14 created a huge post-fest furore. While the Antaragni issue seemed to be a battle of egos, the allegations levied in the Techkriti issue were of a more serious nature. At that time, there were at least a dozen rumors floating around and countless speculations. Now, Vox is here to sift through the pile of suppositions for actual facts. The primary official complaint revolves around the fact that a number of registration slips seem to be missing.",
      "A complaint was made against the hospitality coordinators by one of the festival coordinators and head, finance alleging that the hospitality coordinators had embezzled money. The hospitality coordinators claimed that they had given all the receipts to the core team and any disappearance could have occurred only after that. The hospitality coordinators even said that this was an attempt to frame them – they claimed that the core team had asked them for an “admission of guilt” in writing for embezzling money, even though they had done nothing of the sort. A complaint for ragging was also made by one of the hospitality coordinators against a few members of the core team who came to his room to intimidate and force him into admitting that he had misappropriated funds, claiming that they had proof of it on video. According to the complainant, a committee was set up to investigate this ragging incident but the findings of it have not been intimated to any student.Another remarkable aspect of the entire fiasco is the way workshop money was handled. Apparently, if a company charges an amount X for a workshop, the participant was made to pay an amount Y and the balance (Y-X) was kept for “other” uses. The bills for these “other” uses were produced only after the campus was rife with rumors about the Techkriti team funnelling money for personal use. Not just that, there was an almost overnight change in the number of registrations. The Students’ Senate was given two post conduction reports and around 300 more registration were mentioned in the second report, while the pre-fest conduction report didn’t talk about workshops at all. Maybe these really are just “human lapses” and we’re reading between the lines too much, but all of them occurring at the same time makes the entire thing look a little murky.",
      "Another thing of note is the erratic performance of card swiping machines used to take registration fees from participants this time (in order to make the registration process cashless). According to Karthik Balasundaram, who has handled more festivals than anybody else on campus (as a Finance Committee member for one year, as Convener, Students’ Senate for a short stint, and as Finance Convener for two consecutive years) and is the Convener of the Fact-Finding Committee set up by the Senate to look into these allegations, this isn’t a one-off incident. It was common in both Antaragni and Techkriti last year that the machines stopped working after five in the evening, when the banks close and nothing can be done about it. In Techkriti’14, both machines stopped working on Day 1. Maybe there were more participants coming in at night and the machine couldn’t handle the load. Maybe supermarkets like Big Bazaar have gotten hold of a superior card swiping machine than an institute like IITK (one of India’s premier technological colleges) does not not have access to, for its only inter-collegiate technical fest – supermarket machines are known to work day and night with a large volume of customers and yet rarely falter as often the fests’ apparently do..",
      "Karthik also goes on to say that the way money is handled in fests is highly unprofessional. No proper log books are maintained, it’s all very informal which is definitely not how a fest that has a budget of a crore should be handling its money. If students cannot handle the money properly, then maybe we should reduce the amount that we’re handling or bring in more people to handle finance. I personally have not seen any improvement in the quality of competition at Antaragni even though the budget has been increasing year by year by magnitudes approaching Rs. 15 Lakhs. Karthik says that this extra money is usually pumped into the final night and other professional shows as core teams usually work under the premise “final night chap gayi toh fest chap gaya”. But whatever the reasons, something needs to be done. Karthik believes that a more active involvement of the FAC (Festival Advisory Committee) can curb the problem to some extent. There has been a constant trend for the past 3 years that both fests have been going into deficit and the money has to be arranged by other sources. One of the reasons for that, the marketing team claims, is that companies delay post fest payments.",
      "Anyway, coming back to Techkriti. Another charge is like one of Enid Blyton’s kid detective books: “The mystery of the missing rubik’s cube”. In 2013, Techkriti had attempted to break the world record for the number of Rubik’s cube solved within an hour and for that purpose around 600 cubes were bought. These cubes were then handed over to Techkriti’14. The charge for the disappearance of the rubik’s cubes (RCs) has been levied on one Festival Coordinator by the other Festival Coordinator. Yes, they’re one big, happy saas-bahu family. But the drama aside, the registration receipts are still at large and the culprit(s) is/are sure not going to divulge any information about their whereabouts. The post-fest sponsorship deals’ money has still not been fully recovered (for both Antaragni and Techkriti) and the next Antaragni is already round the corner. This year’s team would probably have to bear the brunt for the sins of the last one. God help our fests!"

Having taken up numerous initiatives in the past few years to encourage young inventors on campus to make their innovations commercial, a need was felt to introduce the fest, which makes an integral part of campus activities in universities and institutes in and around Kanpur and across the country.",

      "It all began with the workers in the institute not getting the minimum wages specified by the government. Meetings were held, committees were put in place but the issue remained far from being resolved. This and a plethora of such problems were discussed in an open discussion session held as part of “Hamara Manch”, a platform devised by the workers to voice their concerns, organised on the 15th of April. Also present amongst the gathering were a few members of the faculty and some people from the student community . The motive of the meeting was to initiate a dialogue between the providers of services and the users which includes the faculty and the student community. The massive gathering was ample testimony to the growing dissatisfaction among the workers regarding the facilities provided to them and fear regarding their future. Representatives from various sections viz. construction workers, dhobis, rickshaw-wallahs, hawkers and mess workers voiced their concerns and blamed the administration for being indifferent to their grievances. Inadequate sanitary facilities , education and lack of a secure working environment were common issues causing disgruntlement among the workers. Moreover, the construction workers were annoyed by the fact that in a case where the contractor had violated the minimum wages law , the institute did not take note and offered the constructor another project, while the workers were thrown out for raising their voices. The dhobis were unhappy with the lack of proper sanitation facilities at the dhobi ghats and with instances of their children being refused admission into the Campus School. They were also concerned with the lack of uniformity in the various rates decided by the different hall HECs. Recent changes like the introduction of washing machines in the hostels have added to their plight. The rickshaw pullers were unhappy that they had not been allowed to hike their rates in accordance with inflation and that the tempo owners were trying to rob them of their business by picking up people from inside the campus. The hawkers were troubled by the incessant pestering by the SIS guards to move their carts and by the orders of the authorities to sell goods different from what they are accustomed to selling. The mess workers were concerned that they are being dealt an unfair hand as they have to serve a proportionately larger student group and they end up working more than is required according to the minimum wage norms. This is due to the fact that private messes do not have a shift system, which forces the workers to work for 16 hours a day . Moreover , their salaries are slashed in lieu of the food they get which is not even provided at times. The undertone of all the voices was that the authorities’ behaviour towards the workers had become highly apathetic. There were certain recommendations forthcoming from the “Sahakari Samiti” which for some time has been ensuring that the workers who are part of their cooperative get minimum wages and at times provides medical aid to the workers and their families using its own fund. After the presentation of their problems by various representatives and voicing of opinions by the faculty members present, the meeting summed up the discussion by putting certain demands (see below). Our take : We, sitting in the comfort of our rooms, have spent enough time thinking of the campus as over and above the tribulations of the world outside. As the student community and the faculty benefit a lot from the services provided by these workers, it is our responsibility to ensure that no injustice is meted out to them. There have been instances where student intervention has been of huge help like some time back in Hall 1, the mess secretary ensured that the daily wage workers also get to work in shifts so that they are not overburdened. It is up to the students to make sure that sections of the administration which do not realise the responsibility that comes along with their authority and which do not pay heed to their grievances should be brought to account for their lackadaisical attitude.",

      "The Students’ Welfare Cell was established under the Presidential Council in the February of 2014. Ever since, the SWC has been working to address various issues that plague the student body, some of which include – implementation of the New ARC (academic review committee) policies such as minors and double majors, tackle the debacles that arise during pre-registration such as timetable clashes. execution of various policies that have been passed by the Students’ Senate but have not been implemented so far, addressing grievances of the students related to the gymkhana or their academics,  scholarships and dissemination of academic information in the student body. Ankur Pandey and Ankit Bhutani, the founding members of the SWC, along with the then Counselling Service Team conceptualized a special task force that is able to address the overwhelming number of problems that the student body faces.",
      "The SWC started off as a small group of motivated members that had the experience of working with various student bodies such as the Counselling Service, the Students’ Senate, and some institute bodies such as the SUGC, SSPC and the SSAC (For the freshmen, these bodies govern the undergraduate curriculum, scholarships and prizes, and student affairs including disciplinary action respectively) and students adept at web designing. With time, the SWC has seen more motivated students join in. Today, the SWC has 25 dedicated members under coordinators Pratik Rath and Sarthak Chandra.",
      "Since its inception, the SWC has been working on disseminating academic information through their website Arya. They have made an interface on which students on academic probation could compute the number of credits they would require to improve. In an attempt to make the cumbersome process of pre-registration easier, the SWC had released videos on how to use the OARS and how the OARS operates.",
      "The underlying objective being student welfare, the SWC aims at bridging the gap between the students and other bodies dedicated to the same cause such as the CS, the UGSAC, the SUGC, departmental committees like the DUGC and Students’ Gymkhana. The SWC is a body that can address all kinds of problem either on their own or by associating with relevant bodies.",
      "The coming year is very important for the SWC as the work they do will decide the direction the Cell takes in the future. The plan of action as of now is to ensure that the minor, double major and dual degree programmes are called on time and students have sufficient time to plan a course of action. The SWC would try to make the pre-registration process a hassle-free and smooth process by suggesting certain improvements to the OARS site and by ensuring that the number of timetable clashes are minimized. This would allow the students to actually exercise the academic freedom they have been promised by the institute. In coming years, the Cell wishes to put in place a program for academically deficient students, to help reduce their academic load until they are in a position to cope on their own. There are ongoing discussions about starting programmes for spoken and written english that aid students with language issues, as English is the sole medium of instruction in all courses.",
      "The New ARC (Academic Review Committee) policies have been implemented to allow for a broad-based education of the UG students as opposed to a department specific one. With 7-8 elective slots and 5 HSS courses in the course template, the students are now enabled to groom themselves in fields (of science, management and humanities) they think will be relevant to their careers. However, most students are not fully aware of the academic rules that govern their programmes and thereby are not able to make informed decisions. Therefore, one of the major concerns that the SWC has decided to address is Dissemination of Information. By regularly visiting UG wings and distributing leaflets, holding multiple interactive sessions, constantly updating their website Arya with all the relevant information, the SWC hopes to broaden their reach among the student body.",
      "The SWC’s work is essentially to act as middlemen between the administration and the students especially for students who do not know how to go about getting their work done. The need for such a cell is best described by Anurag Sahay, the Chairman, Students’ Senate and one of the first members of the SWC –  “One of the frequent criticisms levelled against the Gymkhana is that it never does anything for the benefit of the average student. The Students’ Welfare Cell is a small but significant step to address that, and to provide a place where students can bring any of their problems – you bring your problem to the SWC and we will do everything we can to solve your problem, whether it is with the UG Office, the DOSA Office, Hall Wardens, Courses or even the Gymkhana itself.”",

      "“An entrepreneur searches for change, responds to it and exploits opportunities. Innovation is a specific tool of an entrepreneur. Hence an effective entrepreneur converts a source into a resource” ~Peter Drucker",
      "Entrepreneurship is about solving real world problems using business as a tool! So say, for instance, your home city faces frequent power cuts. You have been really concerned about the same since childhood, and have been cursing the government for the lackluster performance. The one with an entrepreneurial mindset, will take the onus and attempt to solve this problem, by innovating in the alternate energy sector, and coming up with practical solutions to facilitate power distribution across the city, which are reliable and affordable. Setting the home city as a model, he will attempt to scale the solution across the country, across continents, realizing the vision of a world where every home is electrified! Most entrepreneurs are driven by a vision, a problem that they care about, and are motivated to give in everything to give life to their idea.",
      "Entrepreneurship is not a career choice. It’s an attitude, that you can exercise in any walk of your life. An attitude, that requires you to follow your dreams, live your passion, and have a firm belief  on self capabilities that you can make things happen.",
      "“Everything around you was created by people no smarter than you. And you can change that. You can build things that other people can use.” ~Steve Jobs",
      "IIT Kanpur, provides you aplethora of opportunities to cultivate this attitude. Aspiring entrepreneurs should make the best use of their time exploiting these resources, that will help them at crucial points in their entrepreneurial journey!",
      "1.Taking Initiatives:IIT Kanpur campus is not a perfect place. There are problems that you face on a regular basis in your student life, and that may have been persisting for quitesometime now. Talk to the relevant people, and see if you can come up with a solution. Work with the your HEC, or the Students’ Senateto implement your idea. Don’t procrastinate. Fight hard to ensure a better campus life for the IITK community.",
      "2.Campus Entrepreneurship Meetups: Get to know people at campus who areinvolved instartups, and are working on business ideas. We are building an active entrepreneurial community, where in people can get to know their counterparts, share resources, and learn from one another. The community meets regularly, and holds discussions on various aspects of entrepreneurship, pondering upon opportunities in various sectors and getting experts to share their experiences. Talk to your fellows abouttheir startup ideas.If you feel excited about someone’s work, approach that team and figure out how you can add value to their work. Get involved with them to gain some experience.",
      "3.Alumni Meets: We are fortunate to have a very resourceful alumni pool, who comprise the perfect lot to guide you on how to make the best out of your college days. They have been at your place, and can understand your situation. Talk to them about their student life, the decision flow that have shaped their career, and the mistakes they should have avoided. Learning from their experiences is invaluable. Reach out to them over email and social networks. And when they are on campus, catch them up to have an interesting conversation.As per my experience, most of the alums will help you tothe best of their capacity.",
      "4.Competitions: Participate in relevant competitions organized oncampus organized during Takneek and Techkriti.  Make sure that youparticipate in at leastone Busines Plan competitionbefore you graduate. If you participate seriously, you will learn a lot about the very first steps in starting-up, and who knows, that might be the business idea you want to take ahead!",
      "5.E-Cell Events: The entrepreneurship cell at IIT Kanpur is trying hard to create an ecosystem that supports and helps aspiring entrepreneurs. In the process, they invite successful startup founders, to talk about their entrepreneurial journey! Don’t miss an opportunityto catch them up for an informal conversation over dinner. It also conducts various workshops that serve to educate you about startups!",
      "6.SIPP :The best experience for an aspiring entrepreneur is to work at a startup. Some really good companies turn up to recruit interns via Startup Internship and Placement Programme(SIPP). Try getting into one you like. If there isn’t any, scroll through online portals with startup internships and drop them an email. You get to learn a lot working at a startup, given the small team size and the sense of ownership one experiences there.",
      "Its a general notion that there is a risk involved in building your company, and that is completely true.“What if I fail?”is the question that stops lot of people to experiment with their ideas, and take that next step. Quoting Mr.Ashish Gupta, IIT Kanpur alumnus and MD of Helion Ventures,“Risk is not in what you do, but how you do it”.With an IIT degree, you, by default, have a safety netto fall back on. It’s a privilegethat we should be making the best use of. The entrepreneurial ecosystem has been flourishing over the years at our campus. I do hope to see more excitement for startups and the hunger in the junta to build innovative products and businesses!",

      "Of the many programs offered at the undergraduate level at IIT Kanpur, the newest one, chronologically, but not so much ideologically, is B Tech in Engineering Sciences.",
      "The program has been made available to the Y11 batch and onwards. Given the relative newness of the program, it is offered as a branch change option to the students in place of being a branch choice during JEE counselling. There is no minimum CPI criterion, however in case of an overflow of applications, CPI is to be taken into consideration.",
      "The program has two sub- streams, one is B. Tech. in Environment, Energy and Climate (EEC) and other in Mechanics, each with a maximum batch strength of 10 students. The Program Coordinator is Professor Anindya Chatterjee from the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and the PUGC is Professor Abhijit Kushari from the Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.",
      "With a Basic Sciences and B. Tech program already in place, one wonders as to why their is a need to introduce another program. The answer to this lies in the basic idea behind the program.",
      "At the very onset, the program was supposed to be an interdepartmental degree program, relevant for students who wanted to be entrepreneurs or non- engineers. Another thought process was that of being an exit option to save students from termination.",
      "With successive deliberations, it became an interdisciplinary program.",
      "According to Professor Chatterjee, the program began with the initial intention of providing a highly flexible environment for very bright students. As of now, the course template for each of the two streams has compulsory courses from multiple branches, ranging from Electrical Engineering to Civil Engineering. The aim is to equip the students with a set of skills in different areas of both scientific and technical knowledge.",
      "An amalgamation of different disciplines, this program, as advised by Professor Chatterjee himself, needs to be given careful attention, and aspiring students should go through the templates carefully before applying for it. In words of Professor Chatterjee himself, “As an advisor I would say that this programme is more suited for the academically oriented. Students should know their professional goals before applying for it.”",
      "The challenge has been to make it successful at the implementational level. A series of developments took place that gave the program its current form.",
      "It was during Professor SG Dhande’s term, nearing the end of July in 2011, that the institute decided to offer this program to the students. Committees were constituted, rounds of discussions and debates took place which got dragged on for a bit too long for it to be offered to the Y11 at the end of their first year. Then came March 2012. The program had still not assumed implementable form. Details were missing and consensus was still to be reached on how the program was to be carried out. In March 2012, a committee was formed, convened by Professor CS Upadhyaya, to discuss the details and it was to submit its report a month from the date the order was passed. However, due to certain differences of opinion within the Academic Senate, the report could not be completed till the end of the summer of 2013. The last date to apply for branch change, for Y11, was 28th of July 2013 and an information session was organised on 29th of July to introduce the students to the program. They were to decide whether they were applying for change by the 30th, which did not give them sufficient time to make a well informed decision.",
      "In an online survey conducted by a committee formed in the 9th meeting of the Students’ Senate in 2013, 15 respondents expressed that they would have liked to enrol in the program, had they been intimated well in advance.",
      "Currently, only one student from Y11 is enrolled in the program. The program was offered to the Y12 as a branch change option at the end of their third semester. As a result of this, the Y12 batch may have had to adjust their overall template in order to make place for Engg Sc. courses, as they had already chosen their ESOs for their third semester. Y13, however, will be offered the program after it has, hopefully, taken good shape, at the end of their first year and will have enough time to decide which ESOs to opt for.",
      "In the interview with Professor Chatterjee, he stressed greatly on the point that while changing to a new stream, such as this, a student will be giving up on some employability for academic orientation. It should not be looked upon as an escape route from another department as it is not the program that carries one through his/her academic career but attitude one carries.",

It was not the year for the former Bronze winning team of Basketball girls as they lost in a match against Kharagpur with a score of 25- 29. This defeat marked their exit from the tournament. The young crusaders of the football team, having gotten off to a good start, lost in a tough struggle against the rookie team from IIT- BHU. They lost with a score of 0-3.",

Having cleared the matches that took place on 19th and 20th December, we had made our way into four semi finals and were expecting to win an overall gold medal in athletics. The other IITs to look out for, in the tournament, were Madras, Bombay and Kharagpur. If any of the three had won silver in athletics, it could have spelled disaster for us. With a strong line-up in 4×400 m relay, Bombay had very good chances of doing so. Among the girls, the Volleyball team and the TT team made their way into the semis. The girls’ GC however, was a lost cause, with IIT Roorkee expected to clinch the title of Girls’ General Champions again.",

Winning in just two out of the four would have landed us in a comfortable situation with 67 points. In the meanwhile, Madras had chances of scoring  a maximum of 67.5 points, if they managed to win a silver in Athletics.",

Kanpur defeated Kharagpur by 5 wickets and redeemed itself after the Inter IIT meet at Kharagpur in December 2011.  Volleyball girls won us another gold medal. We lost all the other finals.

This catapulted Bombay to the second position overall, with a score of 36 while Madras remained at 35.5.

      "THE SCENARIO",
      "When we go to have a cup of tea at MT with our friends, how often do we notice the person who is serving us? Do we notice whether this person is a child or not? And even if we do, how many of us are concerned about child labor as an underlying and intangible issue that is encouraged in this campus, consciously or otherwise. Vox Populi decided to investigate further and came up with the following rules that are supposed to be followed in the Institute.",
      "In general, The Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 clearly prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 in factories, mines and hazardous areas and regulates their working conditions in nonhazardous ones. And while these rules are to be followed, we know that children right from the age of 8 or 9 are employed in places like the Shopping Centre and MT. Their working hours, especially those who work in MT, are from 6 am to 7 pm. They have no time to go to school or receive formal education, let alone the expense being paid by the employer. Even the minimum wage rule is violated mercilessly by their employers.  And the sad part is that this is encouraged by the general indifference of the public and the apathy of the officials concerned, who are busy in naming each other as the “actual” authorities responsible. When members of the Vox Populi team approached the State Office official, Mr. K. N. Dhakale, enquiring about the rules and the state of child labor prevalent in the campus, he declared complete ignorance of the existence of such a problem here and named a Mr. Niranjan Das as the person responsible for handling cases of child labor. On repeated enquiries and assertions on our side, he sent one of his officers to enquire upon this and finally reported that they could not find a single child under employment! (which speaks volumes of the degraded system we live in). There are a few attempts to redeem the situation of these children, taken up independently by a few concerned individuals. For e.g., “Jagriti” is a rehabilitation centre run for these children where they are provided with food, shelter and education and is run by a fund by the faculty and staff. Also, the education of some of the children in MT is funded by a few students. Attempts were even made by few other students to provide them with night coaching. NGOs like Prayas and Shiksha Sopan also are working for the cause of such children. But these endeavors are few and far between, and not enough to improve the situation as a whole. And improve it cannot, when such an evil is thriving because of the unconscious support it is receiving from the majority of the people, because most of us here are too busy to stand for something as basic as the Right to Education of a fellow human being. It is us who are responsible for the ineffectual system that does nothing to improve the situation, because we never raise our voices against it. We are supposed to be the future of this country, but as we enter into this world, we have to remember that it is our responsibility to provide this country with another generation of a bright future, something we are not fulfilling presently.  It is time we woke up to the situation and join forces to erase this stigma from the campus for a start, and the country as a whole.  (Information as per the survey done in September’06)",

      "When the going got tough, the tough got going – IITK Aquatics Team",
      "“Individual talents win games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” It may have been quoted several times in different contexts, but this is exactly what I felt in my final inter IIT aquatics meet this year when the IIT-K Aquatics team lifted the Water Polo Championship for the first time ever in its history in the recently held 42nd Inter IIT Aquatics Meet at Guwahati. An unprecedented run of victories inundated our team with an enormous sense of achievement as we ended up as champions in boys’ water polo and runners up in girls’ swimming. Pawan become the top scorer with 19 goals to his credit while Kush, Ankit, and Abhishek Gupta quelled the opponents with their unyielding temperament.  Last year, girls were champions in swimming and boys were runners up in water polo. The Aquatics team ‘founded’ by our alumni Avik Bhandari and Trishla Singh three years back as an assortment of “water polo-ignorant” swimmers has come a long way since. The sheer joy of accomplishment that stems from fulfillment of a long nurtured dream now permeates us all. More so because this was not the result of a freak cauldron of luck potion toppling on us, but the outcome of three years of plain hard work, three years of failures and three years of resilience.  Being thrashed 22-0 in IIT Delhi (due to lack of knowledge of rules) and then losing 4-5 in IIT Madras in 2004 to be knocked out of the tournament on the very first day would be enough for any team to lose all morale but we stood up to face the challenge. We sat there, watched and scrutinized all the matches, absorbing even the basic skills and strategies of attack and defence from all teams. After months of hard work and improvisation, we began our victory march at Roorkee by thrashing teams by scores like 14-0, the tables had turned and it was payback time. The league matches against Bombay and Delhi were cake walks and in the semifinals Kharagpur had to succumb to a 5-0 loss. In the finals against Madras, we came close but unfortunately not close enough and ended up as runners up. Many thought that their goalkeeper made the difference but I think we did not have the right temperament as we never thought that we would be able to make it to the final.  After Avik graduated the seniors stepped into his shoes comfortably and the team geared up for the next challenge. In Guwahati, the first match was against Roorkee, which we expected to be a well prepared team, and we were justified after a score of 1-0 after first quarter. But our attack demolished them in the next three quarters. The final score read 15-3. This win reinforced our confidence and faith. In the next match, we bruised the Bombay team’s egos yet again with a final score of 10-6.In the third match against Delhi, we devastated them 13-2, and each one of us, including the goalie was on the score sheet.  On 3rd October, a year after we had been beaten by Madras in Roorkee, we were up against them again.",
      "This was by far the longest, most exhausting and in the end most exhilarating water polo match ever played between any two teams. At full time, the game was tied at 5-5 due to the rock solid defense by both teams. The match remained undecided even after the extra time of play. Penalty shoot outs were the order of the day, with 5 to each team. When we were trailing 3-2 on penalties with Madras to take the next shot most of us thought that it was all over. Kush, who was guarding the post, stepped up to the occasion to maneuver a dramatic save bringing us back in the game. Ankit converted the last penalty that pushed the match into ‘Sudden Death’. Kush continued his magical run by saving the next penalty and then converted his shot which snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.  The stage was now all set for the final showdown against Bombay. After the first 8 minutes, we were trailing by 1-5 and asked for a time out. Our hearts were pounding loud in our ears and pulses soaring high. It was the time to put in that extra effort which can only be driven by years of longing for the moment which was before us. It had come again and we did not let it pass this time. In the next 6 minutes we turned the game on its head to lead 7-5 at half time. Eventually, after few hiccups the final score was 12-9 and the celebrations began as never before. The long wait for a gold to the IITK Water Polo team was finally over. When it comes to women’s events we don’t have a secret weapon. But Akanksha Gupta outdid all her earlier feats when she won GOLD medals in 4 out of the 5 events held namely 50m and 100m free style, 50m back stroke and 50m butterfly. Girls’ team comprising Shaheen, Akanksha, Kumud and Snigdha also won a silver medal in 4x50m relay all of them recording their best timings ever. In boys’ swimming events we had a better performance than last year with Ankit missing the bronze marginally in 100m breast stroke. Prateek Gupta showed promise as he recorded quite competitive timings in many events. The boys’ team comprising of Rahul Sharma, Ankit Jain, Prateek Gupta and Anurag Meena stood 4th in 4x100m relay free style. The team leapt over all hurdles that came in its way. We had seen a dream and made it come true. It has been an epic journey for all of us with a lot more to it than just sports. We will all cherish the moments when we laughed, cried, teased and huddled up together more than anything else in our lives. While lifting the trophy I remember seeing all eyes alit with our team motto: “One for All and All for One”.",
      "Coach: V. R. Vadi",
      "Team: Kush Shah, Abhishek Gupta, Swapnil Bhaskar, Ankit Jain, Pawan Kadyan, Rahul Sharma, Anurag Meena, Dharmananda Gahir, Vikas Joshi, Rohan Bhargava, Prateek Gupta, Shaheen Shah, Akanksha Gupta, Kumud Gautami, Snigdha Chaturvedi. A team comprises of each and everyone who has put in the efforts towards the cause. A special mention is due to Abhishek Poddar, Vikas Shingade and R N Kaushal; they deserve the laurels as much as anyone else.",

At the HC’s reception desk, Arvind, on behalf of the student group, asked for the CMO and on being told that he was not in, requested the receptionist to contact him. The staff at the reception tried to call the CMO at his home but no one answered the phone there. On being asked to contact him on cell, they said that they did not have his cell phone’s number and vacated the desk in order to avoid further questions.

      "Techkriti & Megabucks merged; stick with the “Techkriti” brand-name.",
      "“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.”-Our campus community would beg to differ with Shakespeare, judging by the hullabaloo created while deciding the name of the technical and entrepreneurship festival to be held next year. It had been proposed to merge Techkriti and Megabucks into one festival by an amendment to the Constitution in the 9th meeting of the previous Students’ Senate. In order to look into the various issues regarding the structure of the new festival and to  implement this amalgamation smoothly, a committee was formed. The new structure was decided without much fuss with two festival coordinators (with an unofficial statement that they would be focusing on the technical and entrepreneurial aspects of the festival separately) and the usual structure of heads for events, marketing, PR etc. being acceptable to all. However, the one issue for which a consensus was difficult to be reached was the name of the new festival, which snowballed into a major controversial issue on campus. The question that whether we should stick to one of the original names or conceive a new name was discussed at great length in the Senate, which finally passed a resolution that a change was required in the nomenclature. However, there was an uproar against this decision, which was reflected in the signature campaign that got more than 1,500 participants. However, people in support of the decision cried foul and alleged that the document circulated for the  signatures contained misleading data. The issue had its fair share of drama in the open house meeting which was called to gauge the general opinion of the junta. People came out in large numbers to support the cause they upheld. Passionate speeches were delivered and heated arguments took place with neither group ready to compromise on their point of view . One of the major points raised by those in favour of retaining the name “Techkriti” was that Techkriti already had a huge brand name and it would be much easier for the marketing team to bring in sponsors. They were of the opinion that a new name would amount to wasting the efforts which had gone into building the brand for 15 long years and starting from scratch all over again. In addition to this, they pointed out that Techkriti already had some business events like the Bio-Business Plan which could be expanded and popularized.  The counter-argument was that it was unfair to compare these events of Techkriti with Megabucks, given the scale of the latter and not giving the entrepreneurship  aspect any representation in the name of the festival would effectively mean reducing it to nought . It was suggested that the name Techkriti would project the festival as mainly a technical one and students from top management schools would feel disinclined to participate in it. Those clamouring for a new name cited the example of the IT-BHU festival which emerged as a union of their Techtrix and Opulence and was renamed Magnum Opus. Also, in an attempt to satisfy the concerns regarding marketing, they claimed that IIT Kanpur was a bigger brand than Techkriti and it would be enough to attract sponsors. The meeting dispersed without reaching a conclusion but forced the Senate to rethink its decision. Another Senate meeting was called on 2nd April, wherein the matter was put to vote again. In a bid to keep in mind the interests of both groups, it was proposed that the name should be Techkriti with the tagline “the technical and entrepreneurial festival of IIT Kanpur” and the management events would be placed under the umbrella of “Megabucks” as part of Techkriti. The intention underlying this was that the marketing team could cash in on the brand “Megabucks” for the publicity of the business events, without losing out on the value of “Techkriti”. This was passed by the Senate with a clear majority and the matter was put to rest",

      "After days, weeks and months of gruelling practice sessions, carefully planned meals and workout schedules, and intense discipline and self restraint, the Sports Contingent of IIT Kanpur began its week long quest for the General Championship at the 49th Inter IIT sports meet in the spellbindingly beautiful campus of IIT Guwahati. Each one had a single goal in mind- victory.  With years of struggling for the elusive and humongous, if one may, GC trophy, they were not ready to settle for less.",
      "Having sustained the biting cold of Kanpur during winter camp, when the Contingent set its feet on Guwahati soil, they were greeted with a pleasant weather and an even more pleasant start by the Cricket team. Things were looking good, with a comfortable start by the cricket team and a third place in the points tally as a result of the consistent efforts of the Aquatics team in October.",
      "Summary of the Aquatics Meet:",
      "The Aquatics meet commenced on 1st October, 2013, with Kanpur winning a bronze in 4x100m Freestyle Relay. Parth Tripathi won two gold and three silver medals in various events while Rohit Barnwal won a bronze in 200m backstroke. Harshita Varshney came second in 200m Breaststroke and the girls won another bronze in 4x50m",
      "Freestyle Relay. In the Water Polo matches Kanpur managed to reach the semi- finals stage but lost to Madras with a score of 7-6. Luck was not on Kanpur’s side in the match for the third place as well,  as we lost to Kharagpur by an unfortunate margin of one point.Overall, with the conclusion of the Aquatics Meet, Kanpur was at the third position on the leaderboard.",
      "The main meet, that took place in December, began with the customary march past event. While the contribution of attendance to the points tally was not compromised on, points were lost in execution and appearance and we were in the fourth position with 7 points out of ten, along with many other IITs. Participants were reprimanded for their nonchalant attitude and sloppy appearance.",
      "Day 1; 17th December, 2013:The first day saw a favourable outcome. Most of the pool- level matches were won and the field  was set for a challenging battle for each team on the second day. The basketball team put up a tough fight against the heavyweights of IIT Bombay but lost in both the Boys’ and Girls’ matches by close margins.",
      "The hockey, squash, volleyball and the newly formed football team won their matches right at the start putting us in a good position on the points tally. The prodigies from the Badminton team were off to a good start with wins from both the boys and girls. The weightlifting team, after having excelled in numerous district level tournaments, gave an average performance. Overall, the athletics team had their sprinters clear the heats and qualify for semis. Devi Mutyala of Y12 qualified for the finals of 400m and bagged the gold medal in Long Jump with a record leap of 4.48m.",
      "Day 2; 18th December, 2013:With sterling performances at the onset, IIT Kanpur was faced with tough competition from sister contingents on the second day. The hockey team won against the team from IIT Bombay and secured themselves a place in the semis.Volleyball  boys inflicted a brutal defeat on Madras, winning the match with a score of 3-0. Badminton boys gave the team from IITB  a run for its money and won with a score of 3-0. What could be called the cherry on the top of the proverbial cake was the 2- 0 victory of the TT girls in the match against IITD. Rai Singh Meena of the athletics team bagged gold in 1500m relay, with Deepak Bansal winning a bronze in the same event. Surya Prakash set another Inter IIT record for the institute and for himself, winning gold in high jump. It was not the year for the former Bronze winning team of Basketball girls as they lost in a match against Kharagpur with a score of 25- 29. This defeat marked their exit from the tournament. The young crusaders of the football team, having gotten off to a good start, lost in a tough struggle against the rookie team from IIT- BHU. They lost with a score of 0-3.",

      "Day 3, 4; 19th, 20th December:What followed in the next few days can be aptly described as a ‘roller coaster ride’ for the troopers from IITK. The Boys’ GC was in sight. Having cleared the matches that took place on 19th and 20th December, we had made our way into four semi finals and were expecting to win an overall gold medal in athletics. The other IITs to look out for, in the tournament, were Madras, Bombay and Kharagpur. If any of the three had won silver in athletics, it could have spelled disaster for us. With a strong line-up in 4×400 m relay, Bombay had very good chances of doing so. Among the girls, the Volleyball team and the TT team made their way into the semis. The girls’ GC however, was a lost cause, with IIT Roorkee expected to clinch the title of Girls’ General Champions again.",
      "Day 5; 21st December 2013:We emerged victorious in four of the six semi-finals, namely Hockey, Girls’ Volleyball, Squash and Badminton. The matches for the third place were played in Girls’ Table Tennis and Boys’ Lawn Tennis.  Of all the matches to play in, if we had lost each one, we’d have ended up with a score of 59 on the points tally. Winning in just two out of the four would have landed us in a comfortable situation with 67 points. In the meanwhile, Madras had chances of scoring  a maximum of 67.5 points, if they managed to win a silver in Athletics.",
      "Day 6:With the help of a stellar performance from the Cricket Team,  we had another gold in our basket. Kanpur defeated Kharagpur by 5 wickets and redeemed itself after the Inter IIT meet at Kharagpur in December 2011.  Volleyball girls won us another gold medal. We lost all the other finals. Lawn Tennis Boys and TT Girls won their respective matches for the third place. At the end of all events, the score read as Kanpur: 65 and Madras: 65.5.",
      "Day 7:23rd December. The game of numbers had now begun. Kanpur was almost neck and neck with Madras in the GC campaign. While Kanpur had consolidated its hold on first place in Athletics, Madras’ performance was crucial to the overall GC struggle.",

And hence Kanpur won the coveted General Championship, for the very first time in a span of 49 years of Inter- IIT sports’ meets, outdoing an opponent as formidable as IIT Madras.",

      "This unprecedented victory of ours was celebrated with a luncheon at the Director’s residence. This was followed by a victory march all over the campus, leaving not a single Hall of Residence unbeknownst of its happening. With everything in place, the entire contingent concurs on the fact that there is a bigger challenge lying in wait at IIT Bombay in another cold December of 2014. It is that of defending the title of General Champion and preserving the reputation once created, in the sports meets to follow.",
