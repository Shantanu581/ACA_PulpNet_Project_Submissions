      "On Monday, March 10, the Director of IIT Kanpur sent an email to the campus community ( at “all@lists.iitk.ac.in” ) regarding a long-standing issue concerning the Dhobi Ghat.",
      "Following this communication, the Citizen’s Forum of IITK has issued a response, which is included in the slides that follow.",
      "The Citizen’s Forum is a collective of IIT Kanpur alumni committed to addressing concerns about the working conditions of contract laborers and self-employed workers within the campus. Their efforts are supported by students, faculty, permanent and contract employees, and other members of the IIT Kanpur community.",
      "The views expressed in the response below are solely those of the IIT Kanpur Citizen’s Forum and do not represent the views of Vox Populi as an institution.",
      "Dear IIT Kanpur Community Members,",
      "On 10thMarch 2025, the Director of IIT Kanpur, Prof. Manindra Agrawal, sent an email[1]to the campus community regarding the ongoing eviction of dhobis from the Dhobighat. We thank the Director for putting the Institute’s offer to the dhobis in writing.  Before this, no such assurance  has been given to them in writing. However, the email – though an official acknowledgment of the issue – is also full of misinformation and at times contrary to the Institute’s own action.  We atIIT Kanpur Citizen’s Forum, a group of concerned Alumni of IIT Kanpur, have been raising issues of contract workers and the Dhobis  since 2008. In our hope to engage with the Director on the issue of Dhobi eviction, we have writtenseveral lettersto the Director. But none of them were even acknowledged, much less received a response. In the following we would like to express our  concern regarding the Director’s email:",
      "We feel that it is not right on the Director’s part to insinuate that people expressing concerns, including students and Dhobis, are being misled by certain elements of the campus community. The truth is that the IITK administration has not been communicating with the Dhobis in good faith. It has been claimed in his email thatthe quarters are being vacated because they are “unsafe to live in“ andthe dhobis are not deemed unauthorized residents. Truth is, they have been told in meetings held by the administration officials and  through severalnoticesthat dhobis are unauthorized occupants.  For example, one such notice issued by the estate officer of IITK to dhobis on January 03, 2025 can be foundhere. What the Director is saying is factually incorrect. Either he is unaware of the workings of his own offices or he simply wants to discredit that section of the community which is trying to make the system accountable towards needs and demands of a larger working population  serving the IITK community.",
      "Also, the Director’s email seems to agree with the fact that dhobis are authorized residents of the campus, which would meantwo things: first, they ought to be provided alternative accommodation, if their buildings are indeed unsafe and, secondly the administration was trying to illegally — invoke Public Premises Act as the above mentioned notices indicate — and in fact even conducted a “hearing” in the matter as dictated by the act where they — again, illegally — refused to take into account all the documents that were presented by the Dhobis.",
      "In an emergency Council of Students’ for Hostel Affairs (CoSHA) meeting held on 19thFebruary, it was decided that any new arrangements regarding the Dhobighat should only be undertaken after consultation with both the students and dhobis (for details, please check the article published on IITK students’ magazine Vox Populihere). This is a genuine demand from the students as they are the ones who are going to be affected most with any changesvis-a-visclothes’ washing, drying and ironing facilities. It must be noted that the students discussed the issue in a formal meeting of a very important body of the institute, whose presence still gives some semblance of the great democratic tradition IITK is known for. However, the tradition seems to be withering away under this administration as it does not respect the decision of the body representing all students. Paying no heed to the students’ demands, the Institute constructed temporary tin shades for storing clothes using discarded and rusted material, which posehazards to human health.",
      "Cameras have been set up at places in Dhobighat completely disregarding the occupants’ privacy concerns. It must be made known to the concerned campus community that there are no facilities of washrooms or toilets at the Dhobighat. The Institute even failed to provide such basic facilities to a section of the community which has served it for nearly six decades. In such a situation, dhobi families were forced to relieve themselves, clean and bathe in the open. And, now with the cameras in place, their dignity has been compromised.",
      "[Update –As of today, the cameras have been removed]",
      "Backed by the purported study done by its own civil engineering department and that of HBTU, the Institute has also claimed that the Dhobis’ living quarters and cloth-storing places are structurally unsafe. The Institute is yet to make these study reports public despite the repeated demands of the community members and the alumni. Absent that, we in the campus and alumni community  cannot have enough confidence in assertions that the structures are not safe. Moreover, many questions remain unanswered: Why did only type 1 residences become unsafe? Isn’t it the responsibility of the Institute to ensure safety of not just type 1 but all buildings? Why did it fail to fulfill its responsibilities? On what basis type 1 residences were singled out for safety evaluation? Are all other buildings safe? If the Institute failed to keep these structures safe for the “authorized” residents, shouldn’t it be the Institute’s responsibility to provide them alternate safe residents?We assert that it is IITK’s responsibility.PM Awas Yojna is not to be relied upon for their relocation.",
      "The Director has also floated a few estimates about water consumption in the dhobighat. He claimed in a meeting with Dhobis and students on March 8ththat the water consumption of Dhobighat is 1 lakh liters per day which is 20% of the total water consumption of the Institute. However, we would like to draw the attention of the campus community to the Institute’s ownsustainability report. As per this report on page 10, “considering the large population of our campus, the water demand is high. The estimated consumption is 4 million liters per day (MLD).”. But, as per the Director’s claim, it is only 5 lakh liters per day. Clearly, he is quite off from the estimates reported in the sustainability report. Even if we believe that 1 lakh liters per day is the water consumption of the Dhobighat, then it is only 2.5% of the total water usage of IITK per day. Moreover, we would like to draw the attention of the community to areportas per which the water consumption at Dhobighat is only around 25,000 liters per day. It should be kept in mind that the water usage also depends on the presence of students in the campus as during the holidays/breaks, the consumption is far less. Moreover, as per a research paper (here), the bathing and toilet flushing have been known as two of the most intensive water consumption activities. The Institute can certainly encourage more environment friendly water consumption practices for the households, hostels and labs. Singling out the Dhobighat in this regard does not seem to be in a good faith.",
      "Again, the Director’s claims about the sustainability of machines should also not be taken at face-value without considering the other costs associated with washing facilities. Even if we believe the figure of 10,000 liters per day, that is only one part of the cost associated with the cleaning. What about electricity consumption during washing and drying, depreciation of washing machines, their maintenance costs etc? Presently, Dhobis are providing the services (room pick-up and delivery services of clothes aside from washing, drying, ironing, and folding and packing them for delivery) at ₹10 per cloth item. Will the new arrangement cost less? Not just in terms of resource consumption, but overall carbon footprint. Apart from quoting the less water consumption, the Director must also give some estimates regarding the cost that students would have to bear in the age of “laundromat”.",
      "These machines are also known to be less environment-friendly as far as the release of microplastics is concerned. In a widely publicized research,here,it has been found that the machine laundering released over five times more microplastics than the traditional hand washing of clothes. The normal washing machines are also known to damage the fabricmore.",
      "And invariably, machines will replace labor now being done by the Dhobis. What about jobs for those who would be replaced by the machines? In our society, unlike in the Western countries, we do not have a shortage of labor.  A replaced dhobi not just loses his/her income, but also his/her dignity. We must oppose such dehumanization of fellow citizens. The Dhobis would also lose control over some of the labor processes once they start working with these machines, For example, if the machines break down, they will be completely dependent upon different companies and people to fix them. Even if the maintenance cost is covered by the Institute, the loss over time and customers in the process could be substantial.",
      "In view of the above, we must highlight that the real reason for Dhobi’s not accepting the ‘plan’ is not the instigation by some members of the community. In IIT, they see an institution whom they have served for decades, but who even failed to provide basic facilities like bathrooms and toilets, even in the age of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan; an institution who in the name of alternative arrangements is erecting temporary structures using discarded and rusted material; an institution who calls them unauthorized occupants in the formal notices and do otherwise in front of campus community. If the institute is really interested in solving  this so-called “long-standing” issue, then it should first come clean and build a relationship based on mutual trust with the Dhobi community.",
      "We strongly believe that any new plan as suggested by the Director must be evaluated scientifically and keeping in mind the above noted facts and concerns. It should be even more so in an Institute which claims to be at the forefront of science and technology and wishes to train students to be ethical and serve the community at large.",
      "Sincerely,",
      "IIT Kanpur Citizen’s Forum",
      "Email by the Director to the campus community:",
      "Dear Campus Community,",
      "This mail is to update you on a long-standing issue that is nearing its resolution. The institute has a dhobi ghat on campus near Type I quarters. It spans several acres of area, has water tanks for washing and godowns for storing clothes. In addition, there are several Type I quarters where families of washermen have been living. All these structures are in very poor and dilapidated condition. About a year ago, institute got a structural analysis done of these by experts in Civil Engg department, and the conclusion was that these structures are dangerous to live in. We then got another independent evaluation done by experts from HBTU, who came to the same conclusion. This was reported to the Board in October’24 who instructed the institute to demolish the structures considering safety of inhabitants and to avoid any untoward incident. Based on this, a notice was issued to all residents of these quarters (which included 17 washermen and 61 other occupants) in November’24. Over the next couple of months, all except washermen vacated the quarters and one block has been demolished. Simultaneously, the institute initiated a dialogue with washermen for vacating the quarters. They put forward their key requirements: i) several families have been living there and so need to find alternative accommodation and ii) their livelihood should not get impacted. They were assured that both will be taken care of. For housing, all those who do not own a house outside campus, institute offered to take their case to city administration for allocation under PM Awas Yojna. For the livelihood, it was suggested that they can use the washing tanks constructed in Barasirohi just outside the campus, and continue serving the campus community. After more discussions, better alternatives emerged. First, Alumni Association offered that since PM Awas Yojna allocation will take some time, the families can, in the interim, rent a house in Nankari and AA will pay their rent. Second, institute offered to create a central laundromat with industrial grade washing machines and dryers that washermen can use for washing and drying. This will modernize the entire washing process and lead to significant savings in water consumption (from nearly 1 lakh ltrs per day to less than 10 thousand ltrs per day). The current set of washermen will be given access to this facility and they can use it for washing instead of tanks. In the interim (until the laundromat is built), they can continue using the water tanks and the institute offered to build temporary structures to keep and press the clothes (many have already been built and we are installing cameras for security as well as electric connection for light and fan there). Washermen have been reluctant to accept the new plan. This is understandable as they are used to current setup and any significant shift in setup involves some disruption and adaptation. Unfortunately, some members of campus community have been constantly instigating them not to accept the new plan. They have also used misleading information to instigate student body as well. For example, while the quarters are being vacated because they are unsafe to live, it is being said that evacuation is being done because washermen are unauthorized residents. As a result, despite repeated notices, washermen did not vacate forcing the institute to initiate eviction process. In a recent meeting on 8th March with washermen and representatives of students, institute clarified the situation and asked the washermen to vacate immediately. We hope that the entire process will be completed smoothly, and look forward to setting up the new facility over the next few months.",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the writers and theirs alone.",
      "ThePOSHAct was constituted and enacted in 2013 in India aiming to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace and offer redressal in case of an offence. The act mandates that all employers constitute an internal complaints committee (ICC) to make recommendations for the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace. IIT Kanpur being a primary employer constituted its ICC in 2016, comprising of a presiding officer and five other members from both academic and non-academic sections, and an external member who has experience working with NGOs committed to the cause of women and issues related to sexual harassment. The committee has drafted two documents titled IIT Kanpur (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Students)Rules 2017and the IIT Kanpur (Inquiry into Complaints of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace)Rules, 2021, prescribing the rules for the inquiry into the complaints of sexual harassment. Through an analysis of the two ICC documents, we attempt to understand and critique the existing institutional mechanisms in IIT Kanpur for preventing and redressing internal complaints.",
      "Two primary problems in terms of the content of the policy documents are the vagueness of its language and the omission of relevant concerns. The vagueness of language indicates something which is mentioned but not adequately explained. It leads to confusing and random interpretations by all the parties involved. It may then also lead to arbitrary decision-making by the committee. In the Rules 2021 document, under the section ‘the manner of inquiry into the complaint,’ it is mentioned that “the past sexual history of the aggrieved woman shall not be subjected to probe during the inquiry proceedings and any such information shall be deemed to be irrelevant for the purposes of complaint of sexual harassment”. The lack of clarity about the definition of ‘sexual history’ allows intrusive questioning about the personal relationships of the complainant. Despite the sensitivity towards the complainant that is implied in the clause, it allows for the misogynist practice of judging a woman’s character by questioning the nature of her social and personal relationships. All her social relationships thus acquire a sexual meaning where the assumption is that her sexual history can be understood by examining her social relationships. The lack of clarity about what sexual history means opens up space for character judgment. Invoking the complainant’s relationships, her behavior in social settings, etc. has an undertone of moral policing. For example, the number of male friends a woman has, her outgoing nature, and physical expressions of affection towards her friends may be misinterpreted as her sexual availability. This kind of questioning suggests that the complaint is being judged on the basis of the complainant’s character rather than on the basis of the authenticity of the complaint. As such the onus of having to prove the validity of her complaint falls on the complainant.",
      "The lack of clarity in the clauses applies to the 2017 rules also. Although the document clearly mentions that the rules pertain to those complaints of sexual harassment filed against the students of IITK, there is confusion in the document whether the complainant could be women in the campus in general or specifically the students. When the document defines the act of sexual harassment, it refers to the aggrieved as a woman, while in another place the aggrieved is specifically mentioned to be a student of IIT Kanpur. Such vagueness in definitions and various other clauses causes confusion as to whether the rules apply to all women of IIT Kanpur or only to the students of IIT Kanpur for their complaint against another student of the institute.",
      "The omission of relevant concerns and questions is another point of contention. Omissions could be understood as ideas that are excluded or left out. For example, the Rules 2021 document provides the complainant with the option to make an appeal to the Board of Governors if she is dissatisfied with the report of the committee. But it does not mention the procedure to be followed to make an appeal. Unlike the 2021 document, the IITK Rules 2017, specifically drafted for the students, provides the procedure for appeal. But neither of the documents mentions the procedure to be followed if the complainant is uncomfortable with individual members of the committee and their remarks during the investigation process.",
      "The lack of an intersectional understanding of gender is another problem with the documents. An intersectional approach would see gender interacting with other power structures such as caste, religion, class, and family. People’s experience of sexual harassment in terms of the physical and psychological impact it has on them, and their ways of coping with the experience, and their preparedness to file a complaint depend on their social background. For example, the concerns of a student from an underprivileged caste, or class background may not be the same as that of a student from an urban, upper-class caste background when it comes to filing a complaint. Another way in which this lack manifests is the notion of the gender binary that identifies the victim as a woman while the perpetrator is always a man. The rules therefore turn a blind eye to the experiences of sexual harassment that men or people from the LGBTQI community may face. However, this is not a problem exclusive to the IITK ICC documents but one that is inherent in the law itself.",
      "Moreover, although the 2017 document is drafted specifically to address sexual harassment cases of students, it does not adopt a student-centric approach. Granted the existing hierarchy between faculty and student, a student-centric approach should entail adequate student representation within the committee, as well as adherence to a student’s perspective, which takes into account the context of students and their concerns. The document lacks both.",
      "In other words, without adequate student representation, the power would be concentrated within the committee, mostly composed of faculty members who might not always be able to appreciate and understand the context of students’ concerns. The concentration of power is a result of the top-down model of the committee structured by the institute. The top-down model means that the people at the top have the decision-making power while the people who are impacted by the policies have no say in the matter. The model may also lead to discriminatory practices during the process of investigation. In addition to being a workplace, IIT Kanpur is also an educational institution. Although adequate student representation does not in itself guarantee a student-centric approach, it is definitely a means to address the concentration of power and its consequences.",
      "To contest and challenge the undemocratic nature of the documents in what they say, how they have been constructed, what they imply, and their possible implementation, the campus community will have to initiate a conversation amongst themselves. Through such conversations, it is essential for the campus community to build a critical understanding of the various issues which concern them and possible ways to engage with those issues.",

      "IITK Motorsports is an IITK student team working towards building a racecar. They have been tirelessly working on crafting race cars that have earned them accolades, including a first prize in the electric vehicle category at Formula Bharat. However, like many other teams and clubs, their course took an unforeseen turn with the advent of the pandemic. The pandemic-induced shift from offline to online operations had its share of challenges, impacting the team’s workflow, communication, and knowledge transfer. Despite the hurdles of administration and budget constraints, the team’s indomitable spirit and determination to excel shine through as they strive to build their first Formula Student electric car this year. The team talked to Vox regarding their triumphant rebound from the pandemic and the concerted efforts to overcome the hurdles they face within the institute’s ecosystem, offering an inspiring glimpse into their journey of innovation and perseverance.",
      "",
      "",
      "Vox: Could you briefly introduce the readers to Team IITK Motorsports?​",
      "Team IITK Motorsports was established in 2008 to cater to the student community’s automotive interests and applied engineering skills. We aspire to engineer, analyse, fabricate, and compete against other motorsports teams. The team has previously participated in national and international competitions like Formula Student Italy, SUPRA, Baja, Mega ATV Championship, and Formula Bharat. They are now gearing up for Formula Bharat 2024 by manufacturing the first Formula Student Electric Vehicle of IIT Kanpur.",
      "",
      "Vox: How did the Covid wave affect your team’s workflow and transition from online to offline work?​",
      "During the Covid years, the Y18s and Y19s had to manage the team online. In online mode, it was challenging to coordinate team members’ availability for meetings. Additionally, the team required robust internet connectivity and sufficient data limits to facilitate the transfer of significant CAD and Ansys files. When the Y20 batch was given leadership, challenges arose due to the sudden transition to the offline mode. After the pandemic, the Y20s learned about managing the team offline with the support of some seniors from the Y17 batch students in their last years of dual degrees or masters, teaching them how to run the team.",
      "One of the significant challenges we faced was the inability to transfer knowledge effectively due to the online nature of meetings. We had to figure out many things independently, essentially starting the team from scratch. We embraced a more formal and professional approach to address this, establishing clear communication channels and documentation processes to bridge the knowledge gap. Also, during the transition, our timeline was disrupted, causing issues in manufacturing due to the need for more funds and support. We also faced challenges with the institute and SnT council regarding funding and acquiring necessary resources. However, despite these hurdles, we achieved 1st place in the Class-1 electric vehicle category in Formula Bharat 2023.",
      "Vox: What are the problems that you face from the administration? What are the policies that you would like a change in?​",
      "There needs to be more communication between the administration and the students. We are trying to bridge this gap, and after numerous exchanges with the professors, our relationship with the administration is becoming healthier. We think it’s not only the administration’s problem of having so many blockages but also the student bodies responsible for facilitating the communication. We believe the student representatives should put in more effort to facilitate these exchanges between the students and the administration. Team members are supposed to design and build the car. They are not supposed to spend time and energy to get the logistics and funding sorted from the Institute.",
      "Our constitution needs to be revised regarding the SnT teams. The Constitution states that a student team in the institution cannot rely on the SnT council’s funds. A team like ours needs at least 50,000 rupees every month to function. A circulating narrative suggests that our team’s significant budgetary requirements burdened the SnT council, giving rise to the perceived budget challenge. However, we firmly believe that this narrative fails to capture a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the complexities involved. As the student motorsports team of one of the most prestigious engineering institutes in the country, we are expected to design and manufacture one of the best formula student vehicles; for that, we need funds. We need funds to justify the purpose of our team’s existence.",
      "",
      "Vox: How do you envision the future of Motorsports with and without the support of the SnT umbrella?​",
      "The team operating independently from the SnT umbrella has been debated for the past five to six years, particularly when facing budgetary constraints. Our approach has been to utilise and modify purchased components to the best of our abilities to minimise costs. However, even with these efforts, during the current year, the Y21 team members had to contribute approximately 1.61 lakhs towards the team’s expenses personally. This amount constitutes roughly 1/8th of the SnT council’s budget. We are fortunate to have a faculty advisor who exhibits great enthusiasm towards our endeavours and is always there to help us in deadlocks like these. Conversely, the SnT council also derives numerous benefits from our presence. We have played a crucial role in significantly strengthening the Public Relations efforts of the SnT council and the Outreach Cell. Regrettably, we have not witnessed any significant reciprocal measures to acknowledge or repay our contributions.",
      "Vox: What are your views on removing the post of Associate Head for teams in the SnT council?​",
      "The decision was very heartbreaking for us. We did not expect the council to be so insensitive towards the teams. It was shocking for every team that there won’t be someone facilitating communication between teams and the administration. After the decision was passed, we and other teams opposed it in the next council meeting. There was also a change in the job description of the R&D role, and the General Secretary, SnT, did not acknowledge the exact wording of the change. All the teams came together against the decision. Again, it was a great show of solidarity from all the teams. And we are very thankful to all the teams for whatever they tried to do on behalf of the teams, and in a way, helping team IITK Motorsports.",
      "",
      "Vox: Could you suggest some institutional changes or changes in the structure or functionality of SnT that could help in better functioning and results?",
      "From the team’s perspective, team heads of most of the colleges’ teams are fourth-year students. Having a representation of fourth-year students in team heads can fill the gap between the GenSec and the team heads. Moreover, a robust system of raising funds apart from the institute should be considered because many entities under the SnT council face this issue which directly impacts and hinders their technical growth. Other than that, we observe that the passion for teams and other entities is reducing, which needs to be rekindled.",

      "In light of a sequence of compelling events, Vox was prompted to pay a visit to the Dhobighat- an area on our campus rarely explored by students. The stark contrast to our well-developed and meticulously maintained surroundings left us feeling strange. Half-ruined buildings on the verge of collapse, overgrown grass towering above us- reaching our height, congested and dimly lit surroundings- an encounter with an entirely different world hidden within our own campus",
      "“We serve over 5000 students, 6000 if you include faculty, staff, and others”claimed a Dhobi. The campus currently houses well over 9000 students, catering to the laundry needs of more than half the student population. Their door-to-door services (washing and ironing) streamline our daily routines, sparing us the time and effort required to tend to our clothing. The large number of students using the services provided by Dhobis is evidence of the strong preference students have for the Dhobi’s services.",
      "The other alternative is – you guessed it-the washing machine.",
      "Most students prefer not to use washing machines for a number of reasons.\nWhen one loads a bunch of dirty clothes in their laundry bag to leave for the washing machine room, the fear of not finding an empty, clean, and usable washing machine is a real concern. During the washing, one has to pay multiple visits to ensure the machine is still working and has not stopped abruptly midway- as is common. Afterward, you have to dry as well as iron your clothes. For a student, this process takes a significant amount of time to complete. Not to mention, the washing machines in every hall are in abysmal numbers. There are around 4-5 machines in a hall for hundreds of residents.",
      "In addition to that, the machines we are provided with aredomesticwashing machines and notcommercialones. Over time, the daily, relentless loads take their toll and cause domestic washing machines to succumb to inevitable faults. This is the state of things considering more than 50% of students don’t use washing machines yet (as per the number Dhobis claim). Adding additional washing machines to the halls also appears highly unlikely due to the limited funds allocated to the HEC. Each washing machine comes with a hefty price tag, making it difficult to increase their numbers.",
      "On the contrary, a dhobi offers a door-to-door service of not only washing your clothes but also drying and ironing them, in which virtually no time is lost at the cost of 250-500 (varies individually) rupees per month. For many, thewashing machine alternativeis daunting. But even if we were to assume that somehow, we will have fully functional commercial-grade washing machines and students with the grit to maintain them, the biggest problem is still the amount of time and passive effort it takes to use these machines.",
      "However- and you are probably unaware of this fact- Dhobis have been asked to vacate campus premises multiple times over the last 15 years and something similar is happening at the moment. The primary argument by the administration is related to the legality of their residency(covered later in the article). They claim that the leases for their residences were originally issued under the names of their fathers, who have since passed away. As a result, these leases are now deemed invalid, rendering their current occupation illegal. Further, as the institute is growing, there is a  need for land to build new infrastructure. The dhobi ghat, they believe might serve as land for upcoming infrastructure For more background refer to –https://voxiitk.com/iitk-home-no-more/",
      "With this context in mind, it becomes imperative for us to reflect on our role in the scheme of things-",
      "Asstudents, Dhobi’s service directly caters to our laundry needs, without any intermediaries involved. This makes us their primary customer, and so one of the principal stakeholders. The potential impact of whether or not Dhobis stay on campus has a direct bearing on our daily lives. Not only are we the consumers for the Dhobis’ services, but as students of this institute, we are also stakeholders in major decision-making. When the administration deliberates on a matter that could significantly impact our daily life – even the seemingly minor aspect of spending 50-60 minutes on laundry, it makes sense to take into account the implications of such a decision on students.",
      "The Dhobis claim that attempts to evict them from the campus have not just been isolated episodes but a sustained series of subtle coercions. One of these, they say-  is the administration’s refusal to grant them access to a basic necessity:  atoiletin the workplace. Dhobis have had to defecate in the open spaces right across the Dhobhighat despite the Swachh Bharat Mission followed throughout the nation.",
      "The houses they live in are at risk of collapsing. The Dhobis say that there have been incidents of collapse in the past, causing severe injuries to some. However, the Institute Works Department (IWD) has turned a deaf ear to these concerns and neglected necessary renovations. Overall, the Dhobis describe their situation as an ongoing pattern of neglect and subtle coercion. The episode that triggered the series of events leading to this article was also along similar lines –",
      "Dhobis told us that they were asked by the Estate Office to complete a police verification, following which they would be eligible to receive hall passes. When they went to a nearby police station in Kalyanpur for the same, the concerned policemen clarified that dhobis need not get a police verification done since they are already living inside the campus.",
      "“A few days later,” claims the dhobi,“the police chowki received a call from the Estate Office, who want our passes to be issued only if we are able to produce a residential address outside of IIT.”",
      "The administration has demanded that Dhobis live outside campus, and can continue to serve students like other contractual employees. We asked Dhobis about the feasibility of this idea, Here is what they had to say about it-",
      "“We work around the clock, 24/7.”",
      "6000 customers means a lot, lot of clothes. In order to get clothes washed on time, Dhobis have to work in shifts, so the Dhobi Ghat has to be functional almost around the clock. Dhobis start their work as early as 5 am and work as late as 3 am the next day. Clothes are washed in stages- they are soaked, slammed, cleaned, rinsed, and finally left out to dry. Given a limited amount of space and many clothes, this entire process cannot be completed unless they keep working. This also includes figuring out logistics such as determining the order in which clothes will be left out to dry. If they work as regular employees, they will only be allowed to work for 8-12 hours. They claim it is impossible to wash so many clothes if they are made to work 9-5.",
      "“It’s a family occupation”",
      "The Dhobi is not alone in washing clothes- he is aided by his family. His wife, kids – everybody has a part to play in the washing process. This, they claim- is another necessity to successfully handle the number of clothes they receive. If they are to work as regular employees, only one person from the family will be allowed inside campus premises-which would again, make it impossible to meaningfully finish work in time.",
      "“Students request services at odd times”",
      "The Dhobis tell us that almost every day – there are students who need to get their clothes washed, stains removed, ironed, etc, immediately. They usually get this done by calling their Dhobis, who collect clothes at odd hours and return them the next day. These odd hours look like 1 am in the morning or 9 pm at night. They make the point that not being on campus premises does not allow them to cater to these cases.",
      "“Where will we go?”",
      "Even if the dhobis agree to move outside, they have nowhere to go. They claim they do not have the capital to buy or rent land and/or build a new dhobighat. It’s important to note here that they pay a monthly rent to the institute- for property, electricity, and water. Further, most of them barely attended school and have mostly taken over their Father’s occupations. They told us how they live hand to mouth and how – once evicted, they will not have any means of subsistence- which will affect their services.",
      "Behind the fervent arguments surrounding the legal and utilitarian aspects of the dhobis’ stay on campus, another aspect remains hidden—their relationship to the campus. These individuals, who were born on IIT Kanpur soil and spent their lives living and working on this campus-have seen the ebbs and flows of student life- batch after batch, becoming a part of our collective life here. Forged through interactions and shared experiences, this campus holds for them a sentimental significance.",
      "In 1973, a gang of dakoits launched a brazen assault on our dhobi-ghat. To stop them from plundering students’ clothes- my father endured the searing pain of two bullet wounds—one grazing his cheek and the other striking his leg…and given a chance, I would do the same-remarked one of the many, as washer-folk gathered around us.",
      "When the Institute was established at its current location, a group of dhobis received an invitation from the founding Director, Prof Kelkar. The dhobis played the role in meeting the laundry needs of the campus residents. In return, they were promised a designated work area with basic amenities, such as a reliable water source, sufficient space for clothes drying and storage, and residential quarters for their families. The premises were officially licensed under the names of the primary male members of each dhobi family. Over the years, as the student body grew manifold, the responsibility was passed down to the subsequent generations, with the children of the original dhobis continuing their families’ occupation. These male members, have since passed away – and their children have not been formally allotted the property by the institute- this is the premise behind the claim of their illegal occupancy.",
      "The administration cites several arguments: first, they claim that the increasing use of washing machines by students has reduced the need for dhobi services; second, they propose making alternate arrangements, such as providing more washing machines or bringing in professional laundry services, to ensure students’ convenience; and third, the administration argues that the space occupied by the dhobis is required for constructing new hostels and infrastructure to accommodate the rising number of students in the Institute, and to relieve the crunch.",
      "“Understanding that there are families living in that area and it will be tough to find another place all by themselves, the campus administration has discussed it with the city administration to help find a shelter for all these families and is also willing to provide any kind of help they would therefore need”– this is a statement from 2018, by professor Manindra Agrawal, who was the Deputy Director at that time. We asked the Dhobis about this episode, and they responded by saying that no such arrangement was made following the promise.",
      "The administration of our institute operates with pragmatism and practicality, running an institute of this magnitude comes with its own set of difficult targets and hurdles. They too are stakeholders in this intricate system, working to meet these targets and fulfilling their assigned responsibilities. Then there is the other part of campus- our working staff: the Dhobis, the Mess workers, sanitation staff, SiS guards, and more. These individuals serve as providers of essential services directly benefiting us- the students, as their consumers. Oftentimes, there are tensions between what the goals of the administration demand vs. the welfare and rights of the working staff on campus.  Acknowledging the power dynamics inherent in these relationships, it becomes our responsibility as students- to stand in solidarity with them. After all, we are direct beneficiaries of their daily services, and their well-being closely corresponds to our own.",

      "Following an Office Order by the Director’s Office dated 22 August 2022, a committee was constituted to review the current accommodation status of students and suggest measures to improve the same. What follows is an editorial by Vox Populi in collaboration with the Forum for Critical Thinking on the recommendations made by the committee.",
      "When the pandemic subsided and students were recalled back to campus, a concern that came up was housing the increasing number of students. With Y20 and Y21 students joining the institute, the difficulties in frequent shifting and crunched living conditions were overshadowed by the first offline campus experience. After over a year of the campus reopening and with the Y22 undergraduate batch joining, the state of affairs hasn’t improved much.",
      "In the latter half of the previous year, the administration formed a committee to review the accommodation issue and suggest possible measures to relieve the situation. As of today, the campus houses around 9,000 students. However, the number of rooms available is in the vicinity of the number 6,100 and beds in totality are around 7,100. This crunch, directly and indirectly, affects the entire campus community.",
      "The committee comprised six professors and two student nominees – the President, Students’ Gymkhana and a PG nominee. While the report itself is attached towards the end of the article, the headings of the report can be briefly summarised below:",
      "The committee recognises that the Halls of Residence (which include the rooms, washrooms, mess, and water supply) are designed to accommodate a certain number of students and that there are no guidelines to define the maximum limit of overload in student accommodation a hostel can sustain. A single room in Hall 1 is recommended to be taken as a standard single room accommodation to specify the overcapacity limits of each hostel and be agreed upon. The committee also mentions that ideally, all halls must strive towards having no crunch in the halls over and above the designed capacity.",
      "The committee recommends that the Institute review the current policy of linking accommodation to admission (which makes IITK a residential campus) and delink Institute accommodation from admission. A change in the residential nature of the IITK campus would imply several dire consequences. Over the years, the student residents on campus have shaped many policy decisions. They have also taken up positions to formulate plans for functioning in a massive community like ours at IIT Kanpur. Facilities like messing, security and safety, electricity and water supply, internet connectivity and academic facilities make the campus a place to foster its residents’ physical, mental and social development. De-linking accommodation from admission would imply that students would have to look for housing and other arrangements outside the campus and travel to and from each day. Apart from this, such an arrangement would also introduce a divide among the student community and alienate students from each other who come from varying socio-economic backgrounds. This also raises the question of what happens to existing residential halls on campus. What happens to campus workers who are employed in each of these halls? While the recommendation by the committee appears very succinct, a deeper analysis of why this policy change is prudent needs to be included.",
      "The recommendation to delink accommodation vis-a-vis academic status can be summarised as per the table below:",
      "An important thing to note is that such a policy only partially solves the crunch issue for some. While the campus is short of close to 2000 beds, only 360 rooms are occupied by PG and PhD students residing in hostels and SBRA/NRA residences which have completed the normal duration for their degrees. Assuming an equal number of degree-extended UG students, only 720 additional rooms would be available, which falls drastically short of the requisite 2000 beds that our campus requires. Also, the recommendation recognises that the normal duration of the programme is more than or equal to the minimum residence time but sets restrictions on the kind of accommodation right after the minimum residence time, implying in some sense that any degree extended student has to suffer through crunch accommodation during the extension consequently.",
      "The committee recommends more hostels be built to address the needs of the increased student population.",
      "",
      "In response to certain concerns raised by the PG community, the President, Students’ Gymkhana responded that the since the report does not mention a timeline and is only a set of recommendations, any action related to hostel decrunching would only be taken by a separate implementation committee and that these recommendations would only be considered as reference and would be consulted with regards to the then prevailing conditions. It was also stated that this report considered the completion of Hall 14 by August 2023 for the next academic semester, which is now further delayed. A CoSHA meeting on 14 December 2022 also raised the concern of increasing crunch. The same was to be taken up in an HMC meeting next month.",
      "The recommendations of this report shed light on some glaring concerns and also point to what might be in store for the student community on campus. While the President, Students’ Gymkhana commented that signatures on such a report do not amount to any actions regarding the hostel crunch issue, compliance with such recommendations is still a matter of grave concern since the recommendations do not account for the students’ interest at large. The delay in the construction of new hostels and the tenacity with which the institute has taken up efforts in other construction projects highlights the non-seriousness and lack of accountability to the students with regard to their accommodation situation. Despite knowing that the student strength would increase year-on-year, the construction of the hostels has taken place at an abominably slow pace, with no concrete updates regarding the completion of projects. We at Vox believe that the committee’s recommendations have not been thought through and analysed. Implementing these would have radical consequences on the student community and the campus culture and should thus be taken back promptly.",

      "A team of competitive programmers from IIT Kanpur created history this year by winning the first position in Asia-West in the World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC) – a feat no other Indian team has ever achieved. ICPC, with over 50k students participating from 3000 universities around the world, is the world’s largest and oldest programming contest. And a team of three needs to get through an online local round and an on-site regional round to get to the World Finals.",
      "",
      "Team ACassins – comprising of Akhilesh Sharma (Y18, CSE), Mohan Raghu (Y17, EE+CSE) and Aryan Choudhary (Y17, EE) – talked to Team Vox on how they overcame injuries, visa issues and Dhaka’s notorious traffic to clinch the Asia-West title and how IITK did (not) help them in achieving this feat. Excerpts:",
      "Vox:If you trace back your journey in competitive coding, where will you place the starting point? Can you give us an outline of what the journey has been?At what point did you think you had a good shot at the ICPC?",
      "Akhilesh:I started competitive programming after seeing my brother do it. I began with Codechef before graduating to Codeforces. But it was not before covid struck that I got serious about it. My rating boosted significantly in the lockdown. When I saw Siddhartha Srivastava and Yash Chandnani’s team go to the World Finals, that became my inspiration. My team got a rank of 2698 in the regionals in my second year. In my third year, when my rating was around 2200, I felt I had a realistic shot at the ICPC.",
      "Aryan:I started after JEE, but before joining IITK. A senior advised me to learn C because a lot of freshmen struggled with it in the first year – so, I learnt C from a teacher in Jodhpur. During my initial months on the campus, I participated in the Freshers’ Programming Contest and wasn’t doing very well there, but that’s how I got to know about CP. Then I started participating in  Codechef Long Challenges regularly, even if that meant skipping classes 😉",
      "",
      "Vox: How did the three of you come together as a team? What do you think made you click?",
      "Akhilesh:I was in a different team initially and wanted to get into Aryan’s team. But he wouldn’t let us in (laughs). So, after a lot of team hopping I ended up with Abhinav and Mohan because both of them couldn’t get into Aryan’s team as well! Interestingly, I didn’t know either Abhinav or Mohan – we were brought together by a mutual friend. Later on, after qualification, Abhinav couldn’t participate in the World Finals and so, Aryan joined our team as his replacement.",
      "I guess what made us click was the tendency to not interfere when someone else was coding and respecting and trusting each other. Case in point – me and Mohan did not talk till the Amritapuri regionals! During practice sessions and prelims, we would divide the problems among ourselves and solve them independently. Towards the later stages of the contests we would come together and solve the problem according to our expertise.",
      "",
      "Vox: How would you describe your journey from the regionals to the World Finals?",
      "Akhilesh:The journey was nothing short of terrific, from getting 2698 rank in my second year to reaching the world finals. IITK had tremendous internal competition and was sure to send a team to the World Finals. In a sense, we were just competing with teams from IITK, and did not have to look up to other teams. I have no idea how we performed so well. We went to the regionals with no expectations, but ended up getting the second rank there. We were informed that the world finals would be held in Dhaka. Bad things happened before the ICPC world finals, Abhinav was denied a visa, I got into an accident and was on painkillers the whole time. Indigo was adamant on not letting Aryan board. Two days before the World Finals even Mohan fell sick.",
      "Aryan:In my third year, IITK had India’s rank 1, Yash Chandnani, and ICPC has a hard limit that there can be only one team from a college. My team was 7th in Amritapuri regionals among 300+ onsite teams. We would have qualified for World Finals in 2021 on a wildcard slot because a lot of teams backed out due to covid – if the other IITK team was not there. In my fourth year, we had 3 strong teams competing against each other for WFs. They were eventually ranked 2,4,4 in different regionals. Eventually, Akhilesh’s team qualified for World Finals due to their strong performance in Amritapuri regionals; other teams were close but did not qualify. Later on when Abhinav had issues, they asked me and I was like nekee aur pooch pooch.",
      "",
      "",
      "Vox: How did you prepare just before the contest?",
      "Akhilesh:Since I got into an accident, only Aryan and Raghu were able to practise, they practised some earlier editions of the world finals. We were just rusty but it wasn’t like we did not have knowledge.",
      "Aryan:I would say we were slow but we were able to solve problems. Even during the world finals, once we got our first accepted verdict near the half time, we breezed through 5 problems in the second half.",
      "",
      "Vox: How was your experience in Dhaka? How many other Indian teams were there and what expectations did you start the contest with?",
      "Akhilesh:The traffic in Dhaka was pathetic – worse than Bangalore. Our hotel was 10 kilometres from the contest venue. So we had to leave at 8 am to reach the venue at 10:30. We also had to leave the venue early to reach our hotels on time. The staff and volunteers were nice. Perhaps it helped that Aryan is a celebrity in the coding community ;).",
      "Aryan:The interaction with other Indian teams was nice. The IITB team was great – we used to play poker everyday and the winner would post Instagram stories. In fact, we were playing poker an hour before the contest. There was also some casual sledging. We would rant about the lack of vegetarian food in Bangladesh.",
      "Akhilesh:We had no expectations from the contest, because before the actual contest there is something called the ICPC challenge, which consists of optimization problems. We did very poorly in the challenge, and ranked second from last.",
      "Aryan:I wasn’t trusting Akhilesh with the code (both laugh) because he had not coded for a long time. In the World Finals, we solved three problems on pen and paper in the first two hours but were getting wrong answers repeatedly. We got our first Accept verdict at 2 hr 20 minutes.",
      "",
      "Vox:What are your personal future plans?Would you continue Competitive Programming (CP)?",
      "Akhilesh:I have already announced my retirement on Instagram so I’m not going to pursue CP anymore. ICPC hasn’t changed my personal life plans.",
      "Aryan:I had stopped hardcore CP last year, but you will still see me around for some time, probably because competitive programmers do not have a life outside xD.",
      "",
      "Vox: Your team had zero submissions for the first 2.5 hours of the 5-hour long contest. By the 4th hour, IITK stood at 76th position with only 3 correct submissions. But in the last hour, you guys rose 29 spots to secure the 49th position overall and first in Asia-West.",
      "How did this drastic increase happen in the last hour? What was going on in your mind?Aryan: To be honest, nothing! We just thought this problem looks doable, let’s do it. What pressure do you expect from someone who’s been at the last rank for the first half of the competition?",
      "Akhilesh:  As we had messed up the ICPC challenge, I didn’t take much pressure for the world finals and just wanted to do my best. So, when we had our third AC 3 hours, 40 minutes into the contest, me and Raghu were solving the first problem while Aryan was working on the last problem. We weren’t thinking about anything other than solving the problems to the best of our abilities.",
      "",
      "Vox: How do you think Indian CP culture is different from that practised internationally? What can we do to improve ours?",
      "Akhilesh:CP is pursued as a hobby abroad, whereas this is not the case in India. In Russia, China or the US, kids get exposed to CP in 6th-7th grade and they come to like it. Majority of the students in India are exposed to CP after coming to college and they do CP just to land into good internships or jobs. Most of the people are forced into CP and they too, start very late. Also, there are too many cases of Indians cheating in contests to improve their ratings. There are instances of people passing codes for 50 rupees on telegram. This has had a negative impact on the reputation of Indians coders. They are stereotyped to be cheaters and to some extent, this is true. I myself have seen tons of Indians buy or sell codes for intern or placement tests or just to improve their rating. This also kills the interest of the people doing CP as a passion.",
      "Aryan: Adding on to what Akhilesh pointed out, this isn’t the case at higher levels. People don’t stereotype Indians to be cheaters or undeserving. One big problem in India is that the kids who start early don’t usually grind for JEE. Rather, they participate in IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics, which is the school level equivalent of ICPC). Almost all kids1who perform well in IOI take admissions in foreign universities like NUS or University of Waterloo or even MIT. For instance, Malavika Raj Joshi won two silvers in the IOI but because she was homeschooled, she wasn’t even eligible for JEE. People who represent India in the world finals are people who started CP very late.",
      "In fact, Siddhartha (Y16 and twice ICPC World Finalist) was the UGARC student nominee – the UGARC recommended directly admitting IOI (and other PCM olympiad) students to IITK, but the proposal is taking forever in its implementation!",
      "",
      "Vox: Do you think IITK or the Programming Club at IITK helped you in your journey? If yes, how?",
      "Aryan: Honestly, I think IITK PClub’s responsibility starts and ends with organising the Linux install fest!If you look at IIT Roorkee, the professors there are motivated and their PClub takes up the responsibility of registering the teams. The only reason I could not participate in ICPC in my first year was that I could not find a professor to register for me. (To register for ICPC, a team needs a faculty coach).I would like to see the Programming Club take up the responsibility of registering the teams. Coordinators here did not want to sign up for that role when I went to them with this proposal about 4 years ago. In IITK, we have to approach the professors personally to get our team registered, which is not the case in other institutes like IITR or IIIT-H.",
      "Akhilesh: Moreover, if any other team would’ve won the West Asia title in their Institute, they would’ve got recognition for it back home – but in IITK, few people care. The teams from IITR, IIITH and DAIICT (basically every other Indian team) got a shoutout on their Institute’s official Linkedin page for just qualifying for the world finals. There’s no such culture at IITK. We were the first Indian team to become the Asia West Champion but we got no acknowledgement from the institute. Even the professor from IITR congratulated me thrice.",
      "Aryan:In fact, the PClub here at IITK is so defunct that this year only 5 teams registered in the ICPC online round and 10 registered in the year before. This is a massive decline from 2018, 2019, when almost 50ish teams participated in the online rounds and around 10 made it to the regionals. We used to have introductory ICPC sessions (for first timers), practice contests every weekend before regionals and a lecture series to support participating teams. This year the coordinators seem to have completely forgotten about the ICPC and there has been no publicity for the same. I’ll suggest the current and future PClub coordinators to look at the end-term reports of Y12-Y15 coordinators and you’ll find enough initiatives to work on.IITK FOSS grouphttps://students.iitk.ac.in/navya/about/is dead too. Although if one excludes last year, number of GSOCers have increased over the years. Frankly, it will be better to see PClub split into 4 different clubs (one for CP, ML, Cybersecurity and web dev each). These all are orthogonal but are currently under the umbrella of PClub. While IITR and other institutes have different clubs for each.",

      "A few months back, when I first stepped into my Hall, just when it was getting dark outside, I remember being greeted by a beautiful peacock perched on a tree branch. This place was going to be my home for the next few years, and the realization of it was indescribably delicious. Every night for the next few days, I spent time understanding the space, its corridors, windows, lawns, trees, and people inhabiting what was going to be my House. In his book titledThe Poetics of Space,Gaston Bachelard writes, “For our house is the corner of our world…it is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word.” Which is why it came as a shock when I was constantly made to realize that the house I am inhabiting is, in fact, an encroachment on others’ space.",
      "The word ‘Legacy’ is derived from the Latin wordLegatuswhich means “ambassador, envoy, deputy.” Traditionally the concept of legacy is understood only from a patriarchal inheritance passed from one man to the next. Women were not privy to legacy. Instead, they weregivenasylum within the domesticities of the house. The idea of ownership has long been assimilated within our cultures as a privilege that only men can have access to.",
      "",
      "Hall 04, I am told, has a legacy that could be traced back to the recent past when it was converted into a girl’s hostel. Before theencroachment– by me and my kind – the Hall was filled with laughter, joy, a sense of freedom and independence that now could only be conjured up through nostalgia. It was the place with the strongest HEC, and their decisions were novel and harbinger of change on the campus. While I understand how challenging and unimaginably difficult it must be for the male residents of this place to move elsewhere and create a home again, the unsettling aspect of this nostalgic story lies in the accusation of tampering with the legacy of the Hall by the girls living here.",
      "",
      "Women have often been seen as an extension of the creative, cultural, literary, and scientific genius which invariably stems from men2. These extensions are dispensable, a charity extended by the community of patriarchal ideologues masquerading as feminist sympathizers. We, the residents of Hall 04, believe that even spaces, like humans, have a definitive end. We have settled in this place which now is rightfully and unapologetically ours. Any legacy or carriers of legacy that make us feel unwelcome within these premises, owing to our gender, need to answer to their conscience as to why they think that women cannot work as thinkers and change-makers at par with men.",
      "After I moved to the campus, my male friends, in the middle of a banter, informed me of how lucky I must feel to have ‘taken over’ the legacy of Hall 04. Other men within the campus were dutiful in conveying that the reason they do not visit my Hall anymore is because of the vigilance established outside the Hall gate. They felt threatened because now the space is wrongfully given away to girls whose ‘safety’ is inversely proportional to men’s independence within the Institute. Some men who are in the habit of quoting statistics as a marker of their genius parroted that the canteen workers are unhappy with the turnout of students every day and that some are even considering moving to work at the men’s hostels. Others, remaining honest bunch, proclaimed rather proudly that ‘we’ women have tarnished the reputation of everything the Hall stood for – Freedom, Liberty, and Fraternity, perhaps?",
      "",
      "It makes me wonder how narratives, just like our pronouncements of judgements, facilitate in the process of creation and destruction of a space. These narratives are passed on from one ear to another through stories. Based on such stories – that keep changing each time one utters it – women are expected to carry forward the ‘legacy’ established by the masculine idea of success. Essentially, women’s space is formed on the foundation of claims that men see fit. The unmaking of such a legacy is the primary aim both as a President and an inhabitant of Hall 04. In our tenure here, we desire and aim to leave behind a system that believes in the process of (re)creation without making claims that make the future boarders feel guilty ofencroachment. In a world that is inching each day towards progress, as a woman, I understand and sternly believe that in order to steer clear of propagandas, we need to make a room of our own. Mine is within the margins of Hall 04; where is yours?",

      "“The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing.” – Rohith Vemula",
      "In October 2021, an Assistant Professor at IIT Madras resigned, stating caste-based discrimination at the hands of his colleagues as the reason behind his resignation. Just a few weeks later, a PhD scholar at Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala sat on a hunger strike, similarly alleging caste-based harassment and discrimination by the director of the International and Inter-University Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (IIUCNN) at MGU. The news cycle of the past year itself paints a certain picture of the complex and insidious ways in which caste comes to function in academic spaces. Closer home at IIT Kanpur (IITK hereafter) there was an incident recently, where a group of students received casteist abuses over an online portal. The incident came to our knowledge only because one person chose to speak about it in a close circle.Talking about our own experiences with each other revealed to us a serious lack of institutional and/or informal support systems for students in such situations within the campus.",
      "Academia is often looked at as an island that is cut off from the existing social realities of common life. This facade functions as an excuse to not allow any conversation about the inequalities we experience in our daily life. Discourses about caste are appropriated by anti-reservationists in Indian academic spaces. It is no different in IIT Kanpur. The city outside is divided along caste and class lines, while the campus itself puts up an appearance of being an egalitarian community (that is, modern caste-lessness). There is an assumption here that your caste identity becomes irrelevant as soon as you step inside the campus. But the scarce numbers of reservation faculty hires and the sheer number of upper caste surnames in the various departmental faculty lists tell a different story altogether1. The numbers of Dalit2undergraduate students who were terminated as a result of their purported subpar academic performance are also considerable and worrying.",
      "Caste shapes our social, cultural, and economic experiences. An individual’s caste location determines their accessibility to various resources. Caste in this way is not just a socio-cultural phenomenon but is a hierarchical system that determines our access to resources. Its existence in the realm of dominant ideas determines its perpetuation in the day to day material existence and vice versa. Yet, within academic campuses (especially IITs, IIMs, IISERs) there is hardly any discussion on caste realities and there are hardly any caste-based support groups. For example, IIT Kanpur has the presence of a gender sensitization Women’s Cell but with regards to caste, there is absolute silence.Through this article, we would like to investigate the caste-ridden realities which exist for students of IIT Kanpur. The purpose is to provide a holistic account, which leads to future conversations amongst the student community in IITK and beyond3.",
      "In order to disturb the silence around caste that showcases itself in an apparent caste-lessness in the academic culture of IIT Kanpur, we felt the need to build a conversation and learn about the students’ experiences of caste. We talked to both so-called upper caste4as well as Dalit students. From these conversations, it was made clear to us that we interact with the notion of caste at various stages and facets of life. Through the interviews, we have tried to understand various lived experiences of the students of IIT Kanpur before and during their campus life. These students come from diverse economic, social and cultural backgrounds. Some of the salient pointers that came out are notions of purity and pollution and deep-seated insecurities around caste identities. Common living facilities meant people are expected to socialise, this process has only meant the propagation of caste practices in dining facilities, rooms, and common areas.",
      "We started our conversations by talking about our colleagues’ first memories of caste. One of our fellow Dalit students recollected an incident from his childhood which made him aware of his caste position for the very first time. He had gone to fetch water from a common facility in his ancestral village. “Not only was I denied access to the facility, but my pot was also kicked by one person belonging to an upper caste,” he said. Another upper caste student mentions touching a Dalit teacher’s feet on the occasion of Teachers’ Day. “This gesture was frowned upon by the other upper caste staff of the school. My father was asked by the principal to forbid him from repeating such gestures in the future,” the respondent recalled. One upper-caste respondent recalled how she was rebuked by her mother for taking a kid in her lap in her native village. The kid in question apparently belonged to a so-called lower caste5. All of these incidents take place in the early teen years of these respondents, a stage of socialisation in life when they are building individual and social consciousness.",
      "Another Dalit scholar shared that ever since his childhood, he had started to face a sudden decrease in his scores as soon as his caste was revealed. He did a social experiment in which he decided to exchange his drawing with a friend and discovered that the teacher graded his drawing on the basis of his surname, rather than on the basis of his skill. From their experiences of either being discriminated against for their caste position, or for being made aware of their caste position vis-a-vis being a Dalit or being upper caste (also known as graded inequality), we learned that the students who come to IIT Kanpur come here with the baggage of their caste location. They are already conditioned into casteism, the same casteism which they either perpetuate and/or continue to suffer through in its various iterations.",
      "We collected examples of a system that discourages Dalit students from creating spaces to organise. The attempt is to kill off the radical potential of these individuals who are capable of thought, feeling and questioning. The distinction among students coming from various backgrounds is evident, in their academic as well as hostel life. One Dalit respondent mentioned that their father advised them to be careful about not revealing their caste identity once they come to a campus like IIT. The person did not pay much attention as they thought that these are things of the past and their father is being unnecessarily protective. However, to their surprise, when they came to the campus, they realised that casteism is very prevalent even today, in practices such as asking the new students about their credentials so as to learn whether they belong to a reserved category or not. Another respondent shared an anecdote about his experience in an IIT Kanpur mess. One so-called upper caste student used to avoid sitting with our respondent at the same table, as our respondent used to eat meat. Some may pass this as ‘aversion to meat’, but this aversion itself stems from a hierarchization of entire communities on the basis of the idea of purity and pollution associated with meat eating. This can also be witnessed in the students’ interaction with workers of the campus, especially the sanitation workers. Another time, a girl asked a sanitation worker to pick her keys from a toilet bowl where she had dropped them, while she did not want to pick them up herself. “I felt humiliated on behalf of the worker,” the respondent said. One respondent shared that once, in the hostel, they picked up a sanitation worker’s slippers to keep it out of her way while she cleaned but the sanitation worker got very upset with them as the worker felt that the resident/student had done something unthinkable. Internalised caste-based notions of purity-pollution are veiled and expressed through an urban cultural vocabulary of discrimination such as notions of ‘hygiene’ in spaces of privilege such as IIT Kanpur. The above narratives point out that caste practices are being regularly trivialised and justified through rhetorical arguments of hygiene and biology. These are not just one time incidents but can be understood as crucial markers of caste differences within the student community of IITK.",
      "Academic spaces are conceived as open meadows which allow everyone to socialise and engage on an equal footing. Sadly, academic spaces in India have exclusion at their core, and below we cite some such examples from IITK. We came to know about an unfortunate incident on the campus from one of our upper-caste respondents were, a Dalit student had to take a lift from a senior on a cycle while going to the academic area from his hostel. Later the senior was advised not to repeat such an incident by others because the student they had given a lift to was Dalit. In another interview, a Dalit student recalled an incident which took place in his second year of the undergraduate programme. One upper caste student was allotted a hostel room along with a Dalit student on a sharing basis. After the parents of that upper caste student came to know about the identity of their son’s roommate, they immediately asked for a different room to be allotted. One Dalit respondent recalls a chat with two of his friends regarding a potential romantic interest. It is worth noting here that among our respondent’s two friends one was aware of his caste, and another wasn’t. Upon understanding the possibility of a romantic alliance, the one unaware (of his caste) responded that since the girl belongs to a Scheduled Caste community6, he should not pursue her. This shows that the notions of maintaining caste purity are so deep-rooted that even the possibility of an inter-caste romance is shunned before it begins. One respondent went on to mention that the campus in general is insensitive to caste-based issues. According to him the practice of putting Dalit students under the scanner of merit has been normalised, while for an upper caste student poor performance would be looked at as a lack of attention in studies and not a lack of merit. In this system, merit is a catchphrase that captures the imagination of many. However, merit is nothing but a mere abstraction which justifies hierarchies of the old world and creates new ones at the expense of the marginalised.",
      "Both the upper caste and Dalit students carry the baggage of caste into IIT Kanpur and come across similar hierarchical structures at play inside. We see modern untouchability at work within the messes, where the vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are kept separate and upper caste students refuse to sit beside their Dalit colleagues. Similarly, the sanitation workers who predominantly belong to Dalit castes are routinely talked down by the students and the administrative staff of the hostels and are made to feel unclean despite being the ones who make sure that our spaces remain “clean”.",
      "It has been noted by all the Dalit respondents that the institute does not even acknowledge these issues. There is no support group on campus to recognise the issues faced by Dalit students. While there is an SC/ST cell on campus, its existence and functionality appear confined to merely a webpage on the IITK website. There is almost no initiative to bridge the gaps between students coming from different backgrounds. One Dalit respondent mentioned an incident wherein a male Dalit friend of theirs had to attend an informal discussion hosted by their student guide on their first night on campus, where anti-reservation sentiments were openly expressed. They also mentioned a time when her Dalit friend suffered from an attempt at social boycott by her roommates because of her dark skin and Dalit background. “When my friend reported the incident to the Counselling Service, she was advised to just sort it out with the roommates”, the respondent recalled. Another respondent mentioned how a student holding a position of responsibility within the Students’ Gymkhana, decided never to reveal their caste identity as they feared that they would lose social support from the student community.",
      "The most consistent way caste in academia functions is via the discourse of reservation. Several Dalit students shared their experiences of being mocked, questioned, discriminated against and suffering from attempts at publicly humiliating them at the hands of their peers. One Dalit respondent, during his college days, had observed changes in people’s behaviour on the revelation of his caste identity and preferred to avoid conversations about his caste. Discomfort regarding coming out as a Dalit is quite common among students. A student getting admission in a reserved quota is discriminated against and has to constantly justify why they deserved to get admission at all. This entire ordeal is exhausting and time-consuming, according to a Dalit respondent.",
      "One Dalit student shared that reservation is inbuilt into the caste system for upper castes. Their social status economic background, as well as cultural markers that mark them out as upper caste, all contribute to their being allowed access to socio-cultural and intellectual spaces such as various cultural clubs and societies within the campus itself where the Dalit students have to struggle to enter. One upper-caste respondent for example said that even though he shared the same economic background-middle to lower-middle class-with many of his non-upper caste school peers, the social network he could leverage to further his academic endeavours was absent in his peers’ lives. This is an example of how upper castes are privileged with varied forms of resources at their disposal. In this case, the social network of extended family and friends provides advice and guidance that are an invaluable resource for education which may then be used for upward mobility.",
      "According to an upper caste respondent, “our education system is designed for the privileged castes”. Students are not trained to critically think about their surroundings, rather a certain kind of competitive spirit (which determines merit) is inculcated in the students. Another upper caste student said that the realisation of caste came through interactions during the period when they were preparing for competitive examinations, where the dominant narrative was that certain people got an ‘unfair’ advantage over the others for availing of reservation. Similarly, discussions about caste were not mainstream in his college but whenever they came up, it would be about reservations. Another respondent saw her friend being mocked for using reservation to get into a college. The friend was declared undeserving in their friend’s peer circle. In retrospect, she feels she was as much part of it because she didn’t protest even though she was not among the vocal ones. According to her casteism makes people from the depressed castes suffer from an inferiority complex.",
      "From our conversations with the students, we could get a peek into how caste is woven into all aspects of our social life. We traced their journey from their childhood experiences of caste to how their ideas about caste developed in their interaction with the caste in academic spaces. We could see an uneasiness emerging through their ideas and experiences of reservations especially as within academic spaces, we see caste discourse being diluted limited to discourse about reservation. While the discourse of reservation is necessary to address questions of social justice, it is continuously used to dilute the conversation around caste as a system of graded inequality which is much more pervasive and subtle in its functioning in privileged urban academic spaces. The Dalit students who are routinely discriminated against for availing reservation also end up spending a lot of their energy dealing with the consequences of this discrimination or shielding themselves from it. Caste in this discourse becomes exclusively about justifying the necessity of social justice measures such as caste-based reservation.The need of the hour is to have a comprehensive discussion on caste and caste-based practices within the student community. Only by collective deliberation and critical engagement can the phenomenon of caste be challenged.",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the writers and theirs alone.",
      "Almost two weeks after first being allowed back on campus, Y21s continue to be subjected to stringent, unprecedented, and unreasonable restrictions even though their first year is nearing completion. Y21 students have been instructed not to leave their Halls between 8 pm and 8 am. This effectively means missing out on almost all major campus events, including SnT Code, Musical Extravaganza, and Dance Extravaganza, which run beyond 8 pm.",
      "Unlike earlier years when such guidelines for incoming students would often be less strict and following them would be left as an individual decision, this year, ID cards are being checked during entry into and exit from Hall 13. During Antaragni, Y21s leaving Hall 13 for Pronites were asked to make entries in a register kept with the security guards. While this measure was abandoned due to massive overcrowding, it does not change the fact that the administration found it ethical to use the security section to enforce surveillance on adult members of the student community, whatever their year of study may be.",
      "They were prevented from attending any Udghosh events and were only “allowed” to attend two out of the three Antaragni Pronites, with SGs ensuring that they return after it. Off the record, CTMs instructed SGs to ask Y21s to avoid leaving their Halls unless strictly necessary. Y21s are not allowed to enter any other Halls, even if of their own volition. This also means that Hall 13 – Hall 6 inter movement is prohibited.",
      "Y21s have been warned of “severe repercussions.” In an incident representative of the environment where the batch finds itself, a CS Core team member, on spotting a Y21 outside the Hall premises after 8 pm, threatened to report him to SSAC.",
      "These restrictions deprive first-years of fun and enriching college experiences– like participating in club activities and fests– and infringe on fundamental rights they have, as adults and as full members of the campus community. There have been incidents when Y21 students who want to work in the library after 8 pm or go out for a morning walk before 8 am have been prevented from doing so. Regrettably, this unnecessary management of their lives has not always stemmed from external administrative measures: as a result of directives from their own seniors. Y21s in Hall 6 have been stopped from visiting the canteen after midnight and have been prohibited from accessing floors below the fourth after 10:45 pm since those are the Y20 floors. In Hall 6, few students have been reprimanded for things as trivial as being loud in their own wings or visiting the basketball courts or GH canteen at night.",
      "If one goes by the nature of emails sent out to the larger student community, the implicit rationale behind such stringent restrictions seems to be that it will prevent incidents of ragging. However, the randomness of such restrictions is easy to observe. Nothing changes in the 8 pm to 8 am time interval. Unlike what the administration might want to believe about ragging, darkness has very little to do with it. A senior is as likely to misbehave at 6 pm as they are at 10 pm. The possibility of ragging exists at any time of the year and does not cease instantly on the date that restrictions are to be lifted. Clearly, then, the arbitrary timing restrictions are futile and are set according to the beliefs of a limited number of individuals who take the liberty of deciding what times of the day a Y21 might “need” to venture out of their residences. Prohibiting entry to one Antaragni Pronite, even for those Y21s who already had ID cards, is yet another random strike at the liberties of an individual. Similarly, movement restrictions between Hall 13 and Hall 6 for Y21s are another attempt at policing students: one cannot think of any incidents in recent memory that indicate that such movement exacerbates ragging.",
      "Furthermore, these restrictions give a false impression that Y21s must be careful lest they “get ragged.” That, if they step into unapproved spaces at certain times of the day, they potentiate “ragging” on themselves. In our experience, there are exactly two parties to blame for any incident of ragging: first, the senior students who inflict the torment, and second, the people in positions of power– other senior students and faculty members– who let ragging go unpunished year after year. Instead of holding individuals in positions of responsibility accountable, the current policies tend to exclusively police first-years.",
      "When we asked two Counselling Service (CS) coordinators for the rationale behind the restrictions, they replied that Y21s should not be “exposed to something they would not be happy about” and that such unpleasant incidents tend to be more frequent during fests, especially after pronites. A (CS) Core Team Member confirmed that they are enforcing the measures strictly, because they fear taking responsibility if any untoward incident happens. The CS coordinators we talked to agreed that the restrictions are indeed strict or “dystopic”– some members were opposed to them from the very beginning– but the faculty representatives remained unswayed. The CS currently wants to relax the curfew to 12 am- 6 am: while the DoSA does not oppose this relaxation, a decision cannot be made until the anti-ragging committee reconvenes and approves it. Restrictions are slated to continue until at least the 23rd of April (3 weeks from when the Y21s arrived), in keeping with the tradition of earlier years when restrictions– much milder and relatively unenforced, in comparison– used to be imposed until freshers’ night.",
      "We believe the current restriction-oriented policies are an easy way to bypass the root causes and associated nuances of a problem as deeply embedded in psychosocial factors as ragging. It is indeed simpler to confine students to their Halls than to drive institutional changes and policies that empower them to be equal and free citizens of the community. Such policies directly affect how Y21s conceptualize their membership in this place. They begin seeing this space not as their own home but as a foreign environment where they are subject to arbitrary rules, often enforced without written communication and never with any justifications. Seniors are thus constructed as threatening entities to be afraid of, and the best interaction with them is one that is avoided.",
      "It is not far-fetched to say that the restrictions imposed on Y21s strike at the core of what we envision a full, free life at IITK to be and, thus, must be lifted with immediate effect.",

      "Since March 2020, the return of UG students has always been a much-awaited topic of discussion. With the PG students returning to campus in a phased manner in the last couple of months, the UG community has eagerly been waiting for an update. With increasing vaccination numbers and the active caseload at an all-time low, the student community is buzzing with hopes for any information from the administration regarding the matter. But the threat of a third wave still looms over the nation.",
      "As the discussion and debate on the return of UG students heat up, it becomes important to analyse issues in retrospect. It hasn’t been long since the last time graduating students were on campus. In October 2020, the administration began calling back PG students on campus, followed by the graduating UG students in March 2021. This was also the time when the devastating second wave of the coronavirus hit the country, and its adverse effects were seen on campus too. With students being asked to vacate rooms, and active cases on campus reaching the three-digit mark, chaos ensued in the final months of the even-semester.",
      "In March 2021, with the UG students coming back on campus, the protocols and logistics on campus were completely in alignment with the government guidelines, and precautionary measures were being taken. So what went wrong? While the initial testing and quarantining measures were being followed as decided, a major fallacy in the plan that came forward was the absence of regular testing and monitoring of numbers. After the initial RT-PCR tests, there was an absence of monitoring of symptoms for students on campus. Also, with multiple staff members coming in and going out of campus, the campus wasn’t exactly isolated from the city. It was left to the students to report if they were feeling any of the COVID symptoms, and subsequently, if they tested positive, the entire wing would have to be quarantined and be under lockdown. This was one of the reasons for the social stigmatisation of coming forward since it implied that the remaining people would have to face the consequences, which led to a sense of irresponsibility creeping in.",
      "In March 2021, several instances of blatant flouting of rules and regulations came forward. A digital footprint indicating the clear violation of guidelines came forward, and the students on campus were seen disrespecting the gravity of the pandemic. Scenes from campus included social gatherings, celebrations in confined spaces and disregard of curfews and lockdown. In a specific incident, a student had broken quarantine and went on to roam the campus. In another incident, a COVID positive student had complained to the staff of the Health Center without a mask, which led to the staff being quarantined as well. With the second wave hitting the country and the lack of cognizance by the campus community, the number of cases escalated quickly. This eventually led to sending back the students in the middle of both the semester and the pandemic since the facilities and resources on campus proved insufficient.",
      "In conversation with a graduating student on campus, a concern brought forward was that of the curfew. While the curfew was imposed city-wide, it also brought certain problems to light. Students mentioned how only the evenings were available to them post their classes and lab work and that the curfew implied that they had to stay within their hostels. This, in turn, inadvertently led to increased social gatherings within confined spaces and contributed to the chain reaction. A work-around for the rules was found, and this led to catastrophe. One of the major points also brought forward was that while PG students were also violating the regulations, there was a lack of accountability and a ‘time of our lives’ attitude displayed by the graduating UG students on campus, leading to large gatherings and parties. However, it is becoming apparent that students now better understand the gravity of the situation and the responsibility that they possess.",
      "In addition, it has also come forward in recent days that masks are not being religiously worn at all places, including labs, offices and messing areas by PG students and staff. With the resumption of open messing areas and academic offices, people are susceptible to the spread of the delta variant of the virus. With masks not being worn diligently and a lack of regular testing and monitoring post-arrival, there exists a need for the entire campus community to be more cognizant of the responsibility and take adequate note of regulations that need to be followed.",
      "The following summer of 2021 was crucial for the Students’ Gymkhana. On 7th June 2021, the Students’ Senate decided to form a subcommittee to ‘deal with the obstacles in return of the students to the campus.’ The subcommittee intended to develop Standard Operational Procedures to ensure the safety and health of the student community when on campus. The subcommittee discussed and formulated plans on the following fronts:",
      "The following major takeaways were made in the minutes of the meetings of the subcommittee:",
      "The formulation of the Hall Task Force is a mechanism to ensure that a breakout like last time is prevented and that the situation can be arrested before it begins to spiral for the worse.",
      "The minutes of the sub-committee meetings have been attached in the annexure to the article.",
      "In an email dated 30 August 2021, The Chairperson, Students’ Senate shared the resolution proposed by the President, Students’ Gymkhana and submitted it to the administration regarding the plan for the return of UG students.",
      "The resolutions’ proposals call for the return of UG students beginning 20 September 2021, and that priority is to be given to students with resource constraints highlighted in the online semester. About 12%(~365 students) of the UG Y18, Y19 and Y20 were assumed to be facing certain constraints, among which 165 and 200 are estimated to be double dose and single-dose vaccinated, respectively. The proposal also called for the return of UG Y18 students, citing the upcoming placement season and high vaccination numbers of the student strength. The resolution postscript mentioned the following statement by the Student Body – “..collectively promise to uphold the undertaking that would be sent by the institute. We will also adhere to the guidelines and believe that those who will violate the rules should be penalised. The student body will stand by the institute in any cases of violations which are committed particularly with respect to the pandemic.”",
      "The resolution was received by the administration, and an initial meeting was held with regards to the proposals made and the calling back of UG resource-constrained students was presented. However, any substantial update from the administration will only be given after the Heads Group convenes, and there may be a delay due to the evaluation of resource constraints. Students have begun organized efforts on social media and otherwise to bring attention to this issue and display their disappointment due to the lack of information themselves. Reports of classes being interrupted via voice or chat and asking the professor to address the issue have started flowing in since 6th September. Amidst conversations of mass mailing, interrupting more classes, boycotting mid-semester exams and student opinion surveys – it’s important to understand that the decision to reopen campus lies with the Heads Group consisting of the Director, DoSA, DoAA and the HoDs of all departments. Several professors have sympathized with the students on the issue already and cannot do much except convey the grievances.",
      "A significant part of the promise of UG students returning to campus rests on the shoulders of the student community already on campus and those who may return in the coming weeks. If the student community can display a sense of responsibility and accountability to the stakeholders by following the SOPs and guidelines, it should be safe to proceed with the return of all students in a phased manner. Since the country has risen from the abysmal state that it faced in the second wave, cities are opening up, and the vaccination drive is in full gear, the situation now is very different and considerably safer than the one during the second wave. Many students are suffering from serious problems related to mental health or financial situation, to cite a couple, due to the endless online semesters and it is becoming more and more imperative to reopen the campus. At the very least, the UG student community demands dialogue (in the form of an open house) and a detailed response. Multiple petitions for the same have been circulated via social media.",

      "Prof. Feroz Hassan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences. He specialises in film theory, aesthetic politics and world cinema. He writes on plagiarism by students!",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general.",
      "Every semester, way more often than I would like to (which is never), I give students a zero on an assignment for plagiarism. This, despite laying out the plagiarism policy in the course handout, discussing what constitutes plagiarism in class, AND sometimes after having already penalized the student on an earlier assignment for plagiarism. Such desperate cases make me wonder if there is something really impenetrable about the idea of plagiarism. I think back to incidents from a landmark film,The 400 Blows(1957, France), to remind myself that the concept is not always self-evident.",
      "The 400 Blowsis about Antoine Doinel, a kid who gets into trouble regularly at school, treating it as part of all fun-and-games and as a way of dealing with unsympathetic adults. But sometimes it gets serious enough to involve his parents, so he tries to stay out of trouble by staying out of school, taking a day off to explore the city, which only lands him in more trouble. Antoine’s mother decides to deal with him gently for once, offering him a reward if he does well on his French exam. Sufficiently motivated, Antoine starts reading French literature, and is particularly struck by the description of an old man’s death in a novel by one of the foremost French writers, Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850). He is so affected by this description that he builds a little shrine to Balzac in the house, places a candle in front of it and prays to it. This almost burns the house down.",
      "",
      "Come exam time, on being asked to write an essay on a topic of his choice, Antoine writes about the death of “his” grandfather, reproducing Balzac’s words, which he has by now memorized thoroughly, verbatim. The thing to note is that he does not copy. When returning the students’ answer scripts, the teacher accuses him of plagiarism. The writing is certainly not a 12-year old’s and Balzac’s work is too famous to go unremarked. (Plagiarism is generally very easy to notice until the undergraduate level.) But Antoine very sincerely protests his innocence, and his friend backs him up by asserting that Antoine did not copy. The teacher, of course, will have none of it, and both Antoine and his supportive friend are thrown out of class. Antoine ends up in deeper trouble.",
      "As a spectator, we know that what Antoine did technically constitutes plagiarism, but also that he really did believe he was being honest in what he wrote. We have been witness to his enchantment by Balzac’s novel, and he identifies so strongly with the events it narrates that they become his own. Our sympathies, therefore, are entirely with the student and against the pedantic teacher. And when I come across yet another case of plagiarism, I do have to pause and wonder if I am being the pedant, failing to see an earnest attempt gone wrong, which probably won’t change the evaluation but might give the student a chance to make amends.",
      "In the end, I wish there were enough evidence to label me a pedant, but there generally isn’t. Antoine managed to memorize a substantial text through a strong desire to become attached to it. In our courses, we come across copy-paste jobs from random sources. Antoine knows that a certain quality of writing cannot be improved. We come across attempts by students to cover their tracks by using a thesaurus to substitute words, making for garbled sentences. (Synonyms listed in a thesaurus are words with related meanings, but whose usage can differ vastly depending on context. Using them interchangeably yields nonsense.) Finally, unlike Antoine, you have been told what plagiarism is.",
      "I do understand the challenges for students in writing something on their own when their entire education so far has been based on rewards for rote learning. The difficulties of writing in a language not your own is another major problem. Dealing with entirely new ways of understanding things and new ideas, is yet another challenge. The shift from the level of education in schools to the undergraduate level is drastic for most of us. But thesecanbe addressed to some extent if you approach your instructors early enough and put in the extra work needed to overcome them. You also need to give yourselves time, generally a couple of years, to learn new ways of doing things. Merely expecting a free pass because you have been taught skills that are no longer valid, if they ever were to begin with, will only postpone your having to deal with them in your careers.",
      "Lastly, plagiarism is part of a larger issue, which is of giving importance to what is said and how it is said. Temptation to plagiarize can be resisted if you attach importance to your own thoughts, believe that you have something important to say about whatever it is you are studying, and take responsibility for making yourself understood by others in expressing your thoughts clearly, with skills however limited. I have taught students whose native language is English, and just as many of them as students here struggle with writing, which suggests that the problem is elsewhere.",
      "If you are doing a course or an assignment merely to make up the numbers, then you may have to learn to take your results as impersonally, in as detached a manner, as you take the course.",

      "Vedaant Sikka, President, Students’ Gymkhana, writes about the issue of campus re-opening and reaches out to the general body members to provide a clear sense of what has transpired so far and what the plan is going forward.",
      "Disclaimer:- The views presented below are the author’s own and are not in any manner representative of the views of Vox Populi as a body or IIT Kanpur in general.",
      "The motivation behind this is that I feel it is important for me to communicate with all of you directly considering the online mode has made it difficult for all of us to stay in touch. I would request all of you to please not cherry-pick the statements that have been made and to interpret the article in its entirety and in the right context. The article does not present any moral judgments on any of the stakeholders and is not in any way an indication of who/what is right and wrong.",
      "Firstly, we should take note of our (the students) point of view and motivations and also the institutes about campus reopening. From the Institute’s side, a good place to start would be to talk about the risk and the appetite the institute has to manage risk. Recently, the institute faced this situation where it believed that the existing facilities and infrastructure, both inside and outside the campus, was inadequate to manage the number of cases they had at hand. Hence, the decision was taken to send the students back home from campus. While the above statement is not a judgment on whether the decision to send back students was right or wrong, the institute’s alignment on this matter is to take a low-risk approach towards calling back students. Hence, they are incentivized towards calling smaller batches in the initial phases.",
      "Also, the institute is aware of the fact that online education delivery has not been very effective as compared to the offline system. Students have certainly not liked the format & more efforts are also required from the faculty side in terms of preparations, and still, the output has not been up to the mark.",
      "From our perspective, online education, which comprises not just the courses, but also the interaction with everyone on campus, access to the best academic resources and the opportunity to be part of offline festivals, clubs, societies etc, has absolutely not been able to deliver in comparison to the offline system. Students are deprived of the peer group they had on campus. It is a well-known fact that the group of students at IITK is one of the best in the country and the online model has clearly posed a major hurdle in terms of staying in touch and thus, presents a problem of value and expectation.",
      "The problem is that we(the student body) are facing the lack of experience that we were promised while admission to IITK. This problem comprises the online mode of education in comparison to the offline model, the lack of proper peer interactions & opportunities to develop into versatile personalities. Another severe major concern with the online semester(s) has been its effect on the students’ mental health. The lack of having the ability to readily reach out to our beloved friend circle and have bulla sessions has resulted in deteriorating mental health. The experience of studying at home has proven to be significantly ineffective to impart a holistic experience, to add to this, this model of education has also magnified the disparity in the resources available to students at their homes. Considering that on campus, the students had access to more or less the same set of resources, the online mode has brought forward the severe inequality in the privilege of different sections of the student body.",
      "From the institute’s side, one of the major problems they faced while calling back the students and the subsequent management during the second wave of COVID19 was that the students took rules and regulations lightly, and in adverse circumstances, there would not be anyone to take care of students on campus. While we are made to sign an undertaking, it is also important to understand that the responsibility of the institute does not end there. As the risk of a fatality is significantly high, in the circumstance that something terrible happens, the institute would have to face the wrath of the various stakeholders such as families, students as to why the students were called back.",
      "Coming to a few developments in the recent past and what is being decided on going forward, a brief timeline with the following sequence of events should help paint a clear picture.",
      "Regarding a plan to call back resource-constrained UG students and Masters students, we worked on devising mechanisms and forms to effectively call the resource-constrained students and the plans for the same have been shared with the institute now. They are currently discussing the same and will let us know about any updates.",
      "An open house was conducted by us for the PhD students recently. A call for a similar open house for the rest of the students was suggested to the institute as well. Subsequently, a message was shared to the Heads of Departments to hold open houses for students of their respective departments to gauge the issues being faced by both UG and PG students. The HoDs play a major role in the decision-making system in the institute and are aware of various plans in place regarding the matter of campus reopening, and thus, having HoDs in the chain of communication would help present the students’ side of things efficiently.",
      "Recent developments on the campus reopening issue are as follows:",
      "According to current estimates, an estimated timeline is to have all PhD students back by August third week or August end. In September, we have proposed plans to at least begin with the UG batches along with the Masters’ Batches. As the situation with the pandemic is dynamic, any updates on this timeline would be provided as and when things are clearer.",
      "Since the situation presented to all of us is unpredictable and that there is a lot of uncertainty involved, the problem of misinformation has caused a lot of issues. Social Media and conversations in social circles have had various implications on all of us and one major issue with this has been that solving the problems at hand has become inefficient and has negatively impacted the drive and motivation. In the current scenario, a lot of instances might come up of people being seen as working towards the goal of campus reopening individually or otherwise. It is important to realise that even though the intentions of these initiatives might vary, the outcome would be independent of them. If it was possible to solve problems that way, most of the issues we face right now might have already been dealt with.",
      "In my opinion, there is a lack of clarity between the parents and the institute administration. The Institute is inclined to consider even the worst-case before coming to a decision. There is a need to bridge this gap and ensure that the institute is aware of the parent’s point of view about sending students back to campus. The parents (and students) should also know the actual risk the students will face based on the facilities available on campus. This will also allow parents (and students) to decide for themselves on what is in their best interest.",
      "On a concluding note, the core idea is that the view of people who are responsible for students at home (i.e. parents) needs to be properly told to the people who are responsible for students on campus (i.e. institute). All of this, while knowing that students are not kids. They have to take on independent responsibility for themselves and be involved equally (if not more) in this process.",

      "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed below are the opinions of the Editorial Board of Vox Populi and the writers, and theirs alone.",
      "In retrospect, Vox Populi cited aleakedpersonal e-mail in the article that was intended to be private between a student and the DoSA. It was quoted without providing the entire context.This was a grave mistake and we shall strive to ensure that such an incident never repeats.",
      "As the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic ravages the country, India reported 2,94,000+ new cases on the 20th of April. The very next day, the IIT Kanpur administration abruptly sent out an email, mandating all students residing in Halls of Residence to vacate their rooms and return home within five days of the order[1][2]. Clarifications issued later exempt those students under quarantine/isolation for suspected/confirmed Covid19 from this deadline.  In his emails asking students to vacate their rooms, the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA) cites the dismally overstressed situation of the healthcare systems, both on campus and in Kanpur city, as being the primary motivator for the decision. As of 22nd April 2021, there were 113 confirmed Covid19 cases on campus – 58 of whom were students. The administration deemed it impossible for IITK to handle a bigger outbreak of the virus. Compelling hundreds of students to return to their homes seems to be the only solution that was thought of.",
      "As it stands, while the intention behind this decision will have been to minimize loss of lives, the administration’s actions pertaining to IITK students have been highly exclusionary and disappointing, besides being downright dangerous.",
      "Interactions with and among students reveal valid concerns about returning home. Prior to the announcement of the decision, on April 20, the President Students’ Gymkhana held an online general body meeting with the PG students and stated that he had firmly requested the DoSA to avoid such a course, and only encourage students to vacate. The mail that arrived on the 21st, was thus, entirely unexpected.  (Our report on the GBM can be accessed at[3]).",
      "In response to the eviction order, a group of PG students conducted an online meeting on April 22 to discuss their concerns and chart out a better solution. The meeting had 400+ participants, with multiple faculty members in attendance. The primary concern that emerged was that travelling in these conditions would undoubtedly put students and their families at increased risks of contracting the virus, potentially creating multiple new clusters of infection. Many students had vulnerable family members with comorbidities and were unwilling to undertake such travel. In any case, the decision mandating students to return home, seemingly made without any consultation with student representatives, was thought to be at odds with the notion of students being full members of the IITK community.",
      "Students’ attempts to engage the administration over these concerns were met with no response in several cases. After the meeting on April 21, the students drafted a letter[4]delineating their concerns and requesting a more equitable and inclusive solution to the situation. With over 370 signatories (consisting mostly of students, along with some faculty members), gathered via a signature campaign, the students emailed this letter to the Director, the DoSA, the DoAA, the Ombuds group, and the Chairperson of the BoG. At the time of writing this article, the email is yet to elicit any direct response from any of the addressees.",
      "In every step of the administration’s response to the disaster,empathy– if any –appears almost as an afterthought. Following the objections from the students, the HoDs of some departments organised online meetings with the campus-resident students on April 23 and 24. Here, it was communicated that students with extraordinary circumstances precluding their travel (for example, a Covid19-positive member at home) would be exempted from the order and allowed to extend their stay on campus. The same was formally communicated via an email by the PSG only on the PG mailing list. Hence, many UG Y17s, who were also subject to the order, were not aware of this option – even though the exact same concerns applied to many of them.  Furthermore, most students who eventually requested this temporary stay extension got their approvals on April 25— almost 4 days after the initial vacation directive, and merely 1 day before the deadline. By then, many of them had already left the campus. As a consequence of this heedless policy-making, many returned to households with infected family members.",
      "Continued attempts made by students to engage the administration over the flaws in this decision-making process has been met with disguised hostility. On April 21, a PG student emailed the DoSA, criticising the decision[5]. The DoSA replied with a quote from the undertaking signed by the students prior to arrival:“I will fully comply with any measures/guidelines prescribed by the Institute in this regard”and argued that“by saying that you are against the decision, are you saying that you will not comply and thus go against the undertaking you have signed? (sic)”. The reply made no effort to address the several issues raised, instead circularly justifying the decision on the basis that students were legally bound to follow it. The DoSA then cc-ed the email to the student’s HoD and asked the HoD to“take note of the actions of the students”. Responsible dissent being met with responses that have veiled undertones of negative consequences: does this not go against the very spirit of an academic community?",
      "Furthermore, news articles claiming to quote official IITK statements demonstrate a flagrant withholding and misrepresentation of facts on part of the Institute. On April 25, the news organisations News18 and The Indian Express released articles ([6]and[7]) quoting a purported IITK press release which states that reports of students being forced to leave the campus in the middle of the pandemic“are totally incorrect”. They go on to claim that only“fit students”have been“requested to leave”. On the contrary, the emails sent to the UG and PG students ([1] and [2])  use the word“mandated”: no part of this, in any sense or measure, appears as anything less than forced. Having talked to several UG and PG members who were on campus, we understand that it is a widespread notion that students are being unwillingly compelled to return. As of writing this article, the Institute has not issued any clarifications distancing itself from these quotes.",
      "The blatant lies this statement then conveys, via obscuration of the full nature of facts, appears to be an attempt to prevent the institute’s decision from coming under scrutiny. In addition, the nature of these actions is utterly disrespectful of the attempts of students driven to desperation, to meaningfully engage with their Institution, asking for due agency and representation.",
      "Let us now address the elephant in the room.",
      "India has reported 3,52,991 COVID cases and 2,812 deaths on 25th April. An article published by the New York Times[8]claims that the reported numbers are a severe misrepresentation of the gravity of the pandemic and the true toll remains undercounted –  the actual number of deaths and cases may be two to five times the reported statistics.In an emergency live telecast, the prime minister requested all citizens of India to stay inside and avoid travel to contain the virus spread. Such is the ground reality in which students of the IIT Kanpur have been mandated to travel. Are they at a high risk of contracting and spreading Covid? Undoubtedly.",
      "In the time of a nationwide calamity, the first and foremost responsibility of the institute should have been to ensure the safety and welfare ofallthe residents living on campus. Regardless of its intent, the actions of the administration have subjected hundreds of its students to life-threatening risks. Using public transport at this point is extremely unsafe: there are many students who need to travel via multiple modes of transport, over many hours, in order to reach home. The fear of getting infected, and in turn endangering the lives of one’s own family, would be a constant on their minds. The healthcare infrastructures of almost all Indian cities are failing, and multiple UG and PG students (who shall remain anonymous) who travelled back in the last few days have already tested positive for Covid19 after reaching their homes.",
      "We understand the fear behind this decision. Many Indian colleges that reopened (e.g. MIT Karnataka) were severely affected and were declared containment zones. Amid the horrific second wave, such a situation may befall IIT Kanpur. According to the administration, the Health Centre does not have the capabilities to manage it. (detailed in our previous report[3]).",
      "But if the concerns of both the administration and the students emerge out of a common fear of exposing the IITK community to the virus, why did the former allow itself to leave students with no option, other than to undertake travel during a pandemic, without paying any heed to their opinions? While the students did sign an undertaking, the unexpected nationwide surge of the pandemic is far worse than what could be envisioned when signing to it.Does the legal validity of this signature solely justify the ethics and morality of the administration’s orders?",
      "In unprecedented times like these, it is imperative to explore diverse solutions, while engaging the entire community in an inclusive decision-making process. It is evident that the lack of regard for students’ concerns has left them helpless, heartbroken, and feeling alienated from the IITK “community”. The pandemic has and continues to affect each of us in distinctive ways. We request the administration to acknowledge the plights and the opinions of students with utmost regard in all future considerations.",

      "On 29th September 2015, the MHRD announced its decision to come up with a National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), “outlining a methodology to rank institutions across the country.” Every year since then, the MHRD has released these rankings, which are calculated using a set of metrics that have been amended throughout the years. The latest annual ranking exercise NIRF has shown a few consistent performers in the Engineering Category with IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, and IIT Bombay sharing the top three positions for the third consecutive year, while IIT Kanpur moved up a spot to fourth.",
      "The MHRD claims that the NIRF score is meant to be “a reflection of where the institution is standing vis-a-vis other institutions in the same category.” But are these scores a fair assessment of an Institute’s overall performance? How reliable are these rankings? We try to answer these questions by considering two different, but equally important aspects of the ranking framework- the data, and the parameters used to calculate the rankings.",
      "A significant component of the NIRF rankings is derived from data that had been submitted by the institutions themselves and not been verified by NIRF itself at any stage. To allay this serious concern over the integrity of the rankings, NIRF had claimed that it would be conducting periodic random verification of the submitted data and mandated the institutions to publicly display it. With different rankings getting released each year and the fourth edition having been released recently, so far no reports have been released on the verifications which NIRF had claimed it would conduct.",
      "We studied the data from the Top 10 institutes, looking through the various metrics under which they had submitted their data.",
      "IIT Bombay had submitted data to NIRF under 3 categories: Overall, Engineering, and Management. Under the Overall Category, the Median Salary of a student in the UG 4 Year course, graduating in the year 2019, had been reported as Rs. 27,87,638[1]. This value is abnormally greater than similar data from other peer institutes like IIT Delhi(Rs. 15,70,000)[2], IIT Madras(Rs. 13,60,000)[3], but more than that, it is nearly triple the amount reported by IIT Bombay itself for the previous years (For eg, in 2018- Rs. 10,11,000 and in 2017- Rs. 9,56,757)[1]. Similar is the case for the data presented under the Overall Category for the Median Salary of a student in the PG 2 Year course graduating in the year 2019, which has been reported to be Rs. 50,93,691[1] while the same value for the previous 2 years had been under Rs. 32 Lakhs[1].",
      "This is suggestive of an abnormality in the data submitted by IIT Bombay which necessitated further investigation. A report concerning the placements for the Year 2019, published in July 2019, by Placement Office, IIT Bombay, reports only 204 offers having been made across the entire graduating batch, with a salary over Rs. 16,00,000[4]. This is at odds with the data submitted to NIRF because, on inferring that, we must have had at least  (459(Placed UG 4 Year students, NIRF)+577(Placed UG 4 Year students, NIRF))/2=518 offers made of over Rs. 27,00,000[1].",
      "(Source: [1])",
      "(Source: [4])",
      "The saving grace in the entirety of this has been the fact that incidentally, NIRF does not take into account the Median Salary for calculating the overall rankings[5]. Apart from this particular instance of misrepresentation of data this year, there have been similar reports coming in with previous editions of NIRF Rankings. According to a report by The Telegraph, The University of Calcutta, which was placed at 5th amongst all universities in NIRF 2019, had reported the median salary for undergraduates who graduated in 2015-16 to be Rs. 8,04,400 but in the data presented for NIRF 2017, the same data was much lower at Rs 4,00,000 for the same set of students who had graduated in 2015-16 [6].  Considering the fact that our own study involved only a very small subset from the 1000s of institutions in the rankings, it is possible that other instances of erroneous data might exist.",
      "Due to the nature of this data coming from official sources, it poses a problem in which any person could end up getting misled by such false data regarding the placement statistics of the outgoing batch. It is even worse a situation if institutions had been deliberately sending in inflated figures, seeking to raise their rankings. Even the universities and the institutes are a stakeholder in this since these rankings might determine the amount of funding they are able to secure for themselves[7], perhaps something which might motivate further fudging of data.",
      "At first glance, the metrics used by the MHRD to rank the institutes look holistic and reasonable. As explained in one of our earlier infographic articles concerning the NIRF rankings[8], the framework takes into account the following parameters: “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”. But an in-depth analysis of the parameters and sub-parameters reveals some underlying flaws in the ranking framework.",
      "One of the shortcomings of the rankings lies with its failure to properly accommodate different academic structures under a common framework. This inability to standardize diverse structures results in some anomalies in the scores, and as a consequence, distorts the rankings to some extent. An example of this is evident in the NIRF’s treatment of Dual Degree programs. Most IITs offer explicit 5-year Dual Degree programs during the time of admission itself, whereas IITK offers no such program. Rather, IITK Undergraduate students are offered a chance to switch to a Dual Degree program during their 3rd and 4th year.",
      "Due to this, the NIRF data submitted by IITK has no separate section concerning UG 5-year students, unlike other IITs. Instead, these Dual degree students are listed under the category of “UG 4-year students opting for higher studies”. This induces a spike in IITK’s numbers in the category. The number of UG (4 years) students opting for higher studies in the other (top 4) IITs varies between 50-150, while for IITK, this number is to the north of 300.",
      "This anomaly gives a small boost to IITK’s score in the Graduation Outcome(GO) parameter.",
      "(Source: [9])",
      "Consider the following two scenarios:",
      "Scenario 1:A total of 800 students take admission under the UG 4 year program in 2016. Out of this, 200 students opt to convert to a dual degree program at a later stage. Out of the remaining 600 students, 500 students get placed/opt for higher studies from a different institute.",
      "Scenario 2:600 students take admission under the UG 4 year program, while 200 students get admitted to a dual degree program in 2016. 500 out of the 600 students get placed/opt for higher studies from a different institute.",
      "The two scenarios are virtually similar, albeit a difference in the academic structure of the institute. We would expect a similar graduation outcome metric for these two scenarios. But, the ranking metric used in NIRF results in significantly different outcomes.",
      "In the first scenario, the graduation outcome score (for the 2020 rankings) will be proportional to the ratio ⅞, while in the second scenario, it will be a factor of ⅚ . And although this may sound like an insignificant difference, the scaling of these factors leads to a significant spike in an institute’s score.",
      "In general, there is a huge diversity in the academic framework of institutions. A failure to normalize these diverse structures may cause a significant distortion in the institute rankings.",
      "Another problematic metric in the ranking framework is the State Diversity Index. The metric intends to quantify the regional diversity of an institute, by taking into account the fraction of students from other states enrolled in the institute. But the parameter tends to unfairly penalize institutes located in states with a large population. For example, Uttar Pradesh, being the most populous state, houses more than 17% of the Indian population. As a result, a random distribution of students will tend to have a greater percentage of students from Uttar Pradesh, as compared to any other state. Consequently, IITK has the highest percentage (~28%) of native students, among the top 5 IITs. This naturally affects IITK’s performance in the metric in a negative way. Similarly, IITB also ends up having a low State Diversity Index, owing to the large population of the state of Maharashtra. A better metric could be formed by normalizing the diversity index with the population of the state in which the institute is located. This would remove the bias towards states with a large population.",
      "The NIRF also has a metric for the number of PhD students graduated. The metric takes into consideration the mean of the number of PhD students that have graduated from the institute in the past 3 years. In the past years, IITK has consistently reported a lower number of PhD students as compared to the other top 4 IITs.",
      "(Source: [9])",
      "The number of research scholars that an institute can host is heavily governed by the number of faculty at that institute. A larger teaching community can naturally supervise a larger student community but the metric stated above takes into account only the raw number of students graduating over the past three years into consideration. A smaller number of graduating students could set a wrong perception of the institute and could question the capabilities of the faculties and infrastructure provided. IITK has the lowest number of faculty members among the top 5 IITs.This number is influenced by a lot of factors, one of them being the faculty strength position sanctioned by MHRD. The sanctioned faculty strength for IITK is considerably less than some of its counterparts. Thus it is natural to assume that IITK would lag behind in the number of students graduating from the institute as well.",
      "(Source: [10]",
      "The PhD program is not as aligned as the conventional UG and PG programs. The graduation outcome of a PhD program is dependent on a number of variables such as the faculty strength, the average time taken for completion of the degree, and the number of departments in an institute among others.",
      "The current method of using the mean of the number of PhD students graduating over the last three years, seems a bit primitive. NIRF should try to incorporate the different variables listed above into their framework as well, in order to construct a metric which can give better insights into the PhD program of an institute.",
      "The possibility of errors in the data submitted by institutes, combined with the unfairness of some parameters, raises some genuine concerns regarding the reliability of the NIRF rankings. The extent of the combined distortion these factors can cause is significant. Considering the wide media coverage these rankings receive, they can be misleading sometimes and might have an unfair impact on some Institutes’ reputations. At best, these rankings are just indicative and should be taken with a pinch of salt.",

      "The odd semester for the academic year 2020-21 at IIT Kanpur commenced on the 1st of September in an unprecedented completely online mode of instruction. All the courses of this semester are being hosted on the ‘Hello IITK’ platform, powered by mooKIT, wherein all the necessary announcements, recorded lectures, assignments and other materials are released by the professor. Apart from this, courses have an allocated discussion and tutorial hour every week hosted on Zoom allowing the students to discuss their doubts with the professors and tutors in real-time.The sudden shift to the novel teaching methodology on a large scale has presented an utterly new spectrum of difficulties – both logistical and technical. While the challenges are being tackled by the professors and teaching assistants to provide a smooth learning experience, the alarming number of instances of misconduct and indecency by a handful of students in online spaces have made the journey increasingly irksome for them and for the majority of students trying to pay attention.",
      "Zoom has a feature that allows call participants to annotate the screen shared by the presenter. While this feature aims to achieve a collaborative environment, some students have found inappropriate uses for it. We have screenshots from multiple classes across all batches where students have drawn random stuff to disrupt the flow of the content being taught. In a few cases, people wrote words on the screen with the clear intention of disrespecting the professor and expressing their discontentment with the course content. In one specific case, a student drew the outline of male genitalia on the screen while the professor was teaching.",
      "",
      "",
      "The messaging option on zoom has resulted in excessive spamming by students on completely unrelated and irrelevant topics wherein they directly address the professor and ask them to divert their attention to problems like unbanning PUBG.",
      "",
      "",
      "On a more serious note, in a tutorial being taught by a female TA, a student asked the TA on the chat to turn her camera on and give a better explanation using facialexpressions. While this text could be well-intentioned, the perception and reaction on social media attributed it as a laughing matter.",
      "",
      "In a few instances, the medium of verbal communication was utilised as well. Few students ask doubts completely unrelated to the course content or academics to waste time, leaving professors confused. There have been incidents where a student has hurled abuses and insolent statements directed at the professor, asking them to “shut up”. In one class, participants could hear something which reportedly sounded like a noise sexual in nature coming from a random profile present there. Whether it was intentional or not is debatable.",
      "The veil that allows students to get away with such actions is the anonymity that Zoom can offer if you simply change your name. Multiple such profiles have been observed in classes with names formed with abusive and offensive words. There have also been instances of students changing their profile picture on Zoom to lewd photographs.",
      "Some classes have also witnessed disruption by people not from IITK who infiltrated the discussion after a friend of theirs gave them the link. While the identity could not be ascertained but links were shared only on closed forums so it may be speculated that the aforementioned ‘friend’ here is a part of the student community.",
      "",
      "Instances like these not only damage the experience of the online semester but also talk volumes about the need to start a conversation on civility in our campus. While the lack of civility is a very general problem, it has amplified and managed to enter our classes in the current scenario due to the lack of accountability. The institute has not yet released a structured set of repercussions for acts specific to the online semester, however, the general rules against misconduct in offline classes are still applicable.",

      "“Hardly ever have I known anybody to cherish such loyalty as I did to the British Constitution. I can see now that my love of truth was at the root of this loyalty. It has never been possible for me to simulate loyalty or, for that matter, any other virtue. The national anthem used to be sung at every meeting that I attended in Natal. I was unaware of the defects in British rule, but I thought that it was on the whole acceptable. In those days I believed that British rule was, on the whole, beneficial to the ruled.”",
      "–Mahatma Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments with Truth",
      "As the evening transitioned into the night, a gathering of students and faculty members emerged from the otherwise innocuous chaos in which our campus functions. Most of us stopped for the SL canteen’s tea delaying the event by 15 minutes. These hundred of strangers formed a circle and without a word spoken, we knew that irrespective of our innumerable differences, we transitioned into a collective. A collective that doubts, that is not satisfied, that sleeps in distress, that laughs to veil nervousness and in that we were strangers no more.",
      "You can find the report of what happened during the day in the following links-",
      "Vox Populi’s Post",
      "Nirvaak’s Post",
      "The administration was kind enough to send three cameras so that nothing went unrecorded. The collective in its namelessness was to be dissected later, one individual to be discerned from the other, such are perhaps the perversions of collecting data. I walked next to a stranger, who arrived earlier and probably was not enticed by SL canteen’s tea. The words on the placard that he held were rather peculiar to me. I quenched my curiosity and tried to focus on the poem recitation that had already begun. The intimidation of our campus for reciting “Hum Dekhenge” by Faiz was perhaps fresh in our minds and nervous jitters were coming out like fireflies revealing themselves for a transient moment before becoming one with the everlasting night again.",
      "One person after the other walked to the center, the stage of expression called for his whims, for his expression, and for our ears. In their awkward, nervous recitations,  Pash, Shailendra, Faiz, Jalib, all these poets from different time and space, descended upon the stage.",
      "The stranger confounded by the barriers of language requested me to translate what was essentially noise to him.  I obliged and took note of the lines",
      "“‘फूल शाख़ों पे खिलने लगे,’ तुम कहो",
      "‘जाम रिंदों को मिलने लगे,’ तुम कहो",
      "‘चाक सीनों के सिलने लगे,’ तुम कहो",
      "इस खुले झूठ को, जेहन की लूट को",
      "मैं नहीं मानता, मैं नहीं जानता”",
      "Me: Umm.. well, you know uhh.. it goes something like, you say that the flowers are blossoming on branches, you say that the cups are overflowing and you say that the wounds are healing themselves. These blatant lies, this plunder upon intellect, I refuse to acknowledge, I refuse to accept.",
      "The Stranger: I did call out the blatant lies and the plunder of intellect but I too accepted them. I had my PHY103 assignments to complete so I forgot, maybe I too never accepted them but only lived with them. To me, it seems like, more than the lies, we accept the walls between us. Professors, students, and workers are all interdependent and yet so discreet. Perhaps, you came across the news of the suicide of a security officer, the privileged us didn’t take a moment to offer condolences. Grief cannot be imposed and I refuse to blame the ignorant but I refuse to accept ignorance, I too refuse to accept this plunder of intellect.",
      "And just a simple appeal of refusal by the poet brought forth a call for his own rebellion. We stood there engrossed in our thoughts, the stranger seemed content with my translation and didn’t find the urge to ask further. Perhaps the message was conveyed and it seemed that noise for him took a form of melody calling upon all of us to think, to question and to dissent. After the poetry recitation, a boy with glasses, slightly miffed, slightly anxious, came to the stage and started with, “I am scared of being here right now.” The stranger and I looked at each other, smiling and nodding in agreement with him. He questioned whether one should be scared to ask questions? He asked questions on the indifference of the administration, access to education and critical thought, and the freedom to express, wondering what lay behind the constant misdirection in the face of such questions. The stranger nudged me, the words uttered by the boy with glasses had brought down his walls of apprehensions and compelled him to express himself thus,",
      "The Stranger: All these questions are good and all but tell me why would anyone put their career on the line and for what? What is the cause? His questions bring forth my own questions and dilemmas. You know once upon a time, this was a different IIT Kanpur. I have been told, and pardon the exaggerations of nostalgia, the restrictions were much less in conflict with us. You know this 12 am to 6 am restriction on hall entry for the opposite gender — I am sure someone will explain it to me as to what kind of sorcery is being prevented by this restriction — this restriction, it did not exist previously. A couple was found having sex in their hostel room, how dare these adults express physical intimacy, some amazing people decided it was a great idea to latch their door and complain to the DoSA.  The dean took note of those who complained and reprimanded them as to what business they had in someone else’s room. This was IIT Kanpur. Perhaps you saw the YouTube video where one person said: “Hindustan ek khwab hai” IIT Kanpur is a dream too and to keep this dream alive we will have to keep questioning.",
      "I nodded throughout but my attention was in the event’s unfolding before our eyes. It was evident that the stranger wasn’t the only one whose barriers had been brought down. If the stage was for expression, the platform for people to reach it had been brought down, each had her own reason about what had transpired. To some it was a flutter from a poem’s line, to some it was the call of prose, to some it was seeing their own image in the boy with glasses but to me, it was the placard in the stranger’s hand. I was reminded of Albert Camus’sThe Rebel, where he says, “The first progressive step for a mind overwhelmed by the strangeness of things is to realize that this feeling of strangeness is shared with all men and that human reality, in its entirety, suffers from the distance which separates it from the rest of the universe. The malady experienced by a single man becomes a mass plague. In our daily trials, rebellion plays the same role as does the ‘cogito’ in the realm of thought: it is the first piece of evidence. But this evidence lures the individual from his solitude. It founds its first value on the whole human race. I rebel—therefore we exist.”  The stranger throughout the discussion spoke in a diverse set of sentiments. A summary is presented below for the benefit of readers with the intent of saving you all from boredom.",
      "The stranger was slightly annoyed by the emphasis on the individual. One after another, each individual recounting from her own personal experience, his irritation, however, reached its culmination when someone recounted the horrors of stalking, followed by the apathy of the security section and the counseling service, and the only plausible explanation was through the lens of homophobia. For him, the incoherent brushstrokes of one’s personal experiences had started forming a painting.  Each voice at the center aimed to elaborate on the different manifestations of suppression and alienation coming from within their intimate self. The king is being stripped and the king will soon be naked. The stranger expressed a sense of satisfaction when someone recited a self-written poem called “Laqeer”. The words of the poem resonated with his own. He was back to where he started, the lines and walls all coming together for him, perhaps a fitting conclusion for him and for the discussion.",
      "I pretty much nodded through all the stranger’s mumblings. We both joined for the recitation of “Where the mind is without fear” and maybe at that moment we truly believed the words we recited. However, as the crowd dissipated back into the chaos of our campus, the fear reclaimed its space.",

      "Disclaimer : This is an opinion piece byAshutosh Ranka, President Students’ Gymkhana ’16-17 and Samarth Bansal, Chief Editor Vox Populi ’14-15. Vox neither subscribes nor endorses any ideas presented.",
      "On November 2, IIT Kanpur turned 60. The Institute was celebrating its foundation day, and one of us was at the campus during the festivities.",
      "In his speech, Abhay Karandikar, the director of IIT Kanpur, recounted the glorious history of the institute and anticipated a promising future. But private conversations with students reflected the campus in sharp contrast with the director’s remarks.",
      "All is not well. Over the last few years, various administrative bodies have systematically instilled a culture of fear among students. Dissent is met with punitive action, student opinion is disregarded and individual students are targeted. Consequential and high-stakes decisions are backed by arbitrary rules. Add to that the increased interference in student affairs and you get an image of the Institute that is beyond recognition. This is not the IIT Kanpur we love and remember.",
      "That sense was accentuated by recent articles on administrative overreach published inVox Populi,the student media body, which triggered heated discussions in the Facebook group of IIT Kanpur Alumni Association. On campus, the students observed a unity day on November 12th: 2,600 students signed a document expressing their concerns.",
      "",
      "Many of our friends contacted us to know more. We ourselves knew little. So we decided to find out more and share our findings with the alumni community.",
      "Things appear bleak. In repeated conversations, we encountered serious issues directly concerning the fundamental ethos of the Institute and our prized possession: student freedom. The stories kept changing but the message remained the same: something fundamentally has changed in the attitude of the administration towards students — and not for the good.",
      "Let’s start with hostel affairs:In a general body meeting, three students of Hall-8 had a verbal argument with one of the wardens. The warden did not like it: he asked the student to leave the Institute if they had issues with hostel policies. To which a student responded that the same applies to the warden: a student can say that the warden should step down.",
      "Things escalated further: the three students were issued show-cause notices demanding an unconditional apology for the incident. One student argued over email, making his case. Result: he was given an eviction notice.",
      "Yes, you read it right: a student was issued a notice to leave the hostel for having a difference of opinion with the warden regarding hall policies.",
      "This is not an isolated incident.",
      "Here iswhat happened in Hall-1: a student wrote an email to the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA) expressing concerns over issues faced by hall residents. Two days later, when the student was attending a lecture, the hall office staff came looking for the student in his wing. Not able to find him, they locked up his room. In a subsequent meeting, the warden shouted at the student claiming that he was trying to defame the hall management for issues that do not exist.",
      "Do issues not exist? Sample this: in an email, the warden said a student’s room is not a private place; in a verbal order, he ordered students to keep the doors of the room open when a girl was present, because a locked room with a girl inside — we are not making this up — “raises doubts”. “We are living in India and not the USA,” the warden told students, in the clearest indication of orthodox moral policing.",
      "“For your information, hall premise is not a private place which includes your room. Hence, you may not do what you indent do at your home, which is considered as your private place.” (Hall-1 Warden in an email)",
      "If the students did not raise their voice on such outrageous views of the warden, that would have been a concern in itself. We are glad they did.",
      "Even faculty members concur: “Clearly such people should not be made warden of student halls,” Professor Sandeep Shukla, HoD Computer Science, wrote on Facebook, referring to the Hall-1 incident.",
      "This is not acceptable. In fact, the Hall-1 incident points to another problem: warden appointment without the consultation of the Hall Executive Committees. That’s how the Hall-1 warden got the job and has happened quite a few times in Hall-6 (GH Tower).",
      "The problem extends beyond hostels. Take the Senate Students’ Affairs Committee (SSAC), the body which oversees cases of student indiscipline.",
      "In 2018, a misbehaving student played a vulgar audio clip in a CSO tutorial led by a female student TA. The teacher, rightly, filed a complaint. The case went to ICC.",
      "The investigating committee was unable to identify the culprit with no witnesses coming forward from the students’ side about who had played the clip. So what did they do? The committee decided to “teach students a lesson” by handing out a blanket punishment to all the students in the tutorial by handing out grade drops.",
      "The CSO case is a classic example of the administration over punishing students without taking a constructive approach to tackle the root cause. The investigating committee overstepped in two fundamental ways.",
      "First, blanket punishment:Punishing the entire tutorial section for an action that a single individual committed violates all terms of natural justice. A student who has come to learn in this institute, is diligently attending tutorials, is being punished for the actions of some individual who she is not responsible for.",
      "Second, academic punishment:Even if the committee decided that an example had to be set and the entire group of students punished, attacking their academic credential by down-grading the grades they received for a behavioural issue was not the right path to take.",
      "Punishments like mandatory community service and mandatory sensitisation classes would have tackled the issue at hand and helped the students grow as individuals while also handing out the necessary message to the student community. There seems to be a marked shift from a focus on corrective measures to blind punishments which is worrying.",
      "This entire incident is indicative of a fetish of the administration:“Sending out a message to the students”.",
      "Student representatives have heard this term used innumerable times to explain away punishments that are harsh. The administration has started treating the student body like an adversarial force to be conquered by sending out power signals and ‘messages’ rather than a group of minds to be enlightened and polished in the ways of the world with constructive dialogue and mentorship.",
      "The same script has played out on multiple occasions.",
      "In September 2017, responding to a ragging complaint filed by some Y17 students, the SSAC decided to take punitive action over 100 students, and punishments included all possible actions in the purview of the SSAC.",
      "However, mandatory procedures were not followed in the SSAC meeting, theStudents’ Senate noted in a resolution addressed to the Director: the accused students were not even informed that a complaint was being considered against them, denying them an opportunity to present their case; the guilt of all individuals that were to be punished was not established beyond a point of reasonable doubt, according to Students’ Senate nominees to the SSAC; and the committee took upon itself to take punitive action on an entire group in which some members may be completely innocent.",
      "According to a report inVox Populi,“the Students’ Senate noted that the SSAC acted in violation of the democratic foundations” and the incident is “evidence of the autocratic approach taken by the SSAC as it completely undermines the authority and power of the Students’ Senate, and thus the students.”",
      "Make no mistake: we are not downplaying the students’ fault. Discipline is important, and obviously, there is a reason why cases are referred to the SSAC in the first place. No one is denying that. What we are worried about is the ruthless response of the administration.",
      "What’s more? There are no signs that things will improve. In 2018, a new SSAC manual was approved. Under the new regime, SSAC would move from a rule-based decision making to discuss cases on an individual basis, meaning more arbitrary and discretionary power to professors. The strength of professors in the committee was also increased, making it an effective tool in the hands of the faculty to punish the students.",
      "This fear seems to be deeply entrenched in the student community. WhenVox Populireported the aforementioned Hall-1 warden incident, the editors were afraid to even name the concerned professor, fearing punitive reaction from the administration.",
      "And why would students not be afraid: if all this was not enough, students are faced with a whole bunch of other issues concerning campus security.",
      "In 2017, things took an ugly turn:students’ freedom of movement inside the campus was restrained. Back then, a final year student alleged that the then Chairman of the Security Advisory and Executive Committee (SAEC), threatened to file an FIR for not carrying his ID card inside the campus at 1.30 am. A female postgraduate student said she didn’t feel safe in the hostel anymore because of the personal grudge a security officer developed against her. Guards would arbitrarily pick on students and threatened them with punitive action. Some students were called criminals and thieves, and faced harassment.",
      "“Lots of students and recent alumni have written their experiences with security and the harassment they faced. Many have sent me emails,” Dr Dheeraj Sanghi, then the professor of Computer Science at IIT Kanpur, wrote on his blog at the time.",
      "“Establishment of security raj on IIT Kanpur campus has followed the destruction of administrative mechanisms of maintaining discipline.”",
      "Students now complain about how arbitrary verbal orders being treated as rule of law, with nothing in writing. For instance, there is no approved policy of not allowing female students outside the campus between midnight to 6 AM. Regardless, that is the restriction imposed by the security unit—and only for girls.",
      "Moreover, surveillance is touching alarming levels: hundreds of cameras have been installed across the campus. “IIT Kanpur feels like a prison,”a student wrote in an op-ed forVox Populi.",
      "The surveillance infrastructure is increasing without public guidelines to safeguard data from misuse. “Places where active surveillance is allowed and not allowed be clearly stated in a guideline, along with clear guidelines on what data is being collected and stored,” students wrote in a resolution addressed to the Director.",
      "This is not a healthy setting. This is not an environment conducive for opening up minds to ideas. This does not fit into the idea of a university.",
      "The story doesn’t end there. Students have reported increasing administrative interference in the functioning of the Students’ Gymkhana.",
      "In a general body meeting held in October, the students highlighted the “problems with the general demeanour, attitude, and actions of the Associate Dean of Students’ Affairs,”Vox Populinoted in a report.",
      "“The student representatives claimed to have experienced a structural exclusion from the system on multiple fronts which warns of a scary shift in the administration’s outlook towards students’ say on campus issues,” the report said.",
      "“Unavailability in his office and on other media, unreasonable demands and unprofessional demeaning comments towards certain students have served as major hindrances in the communication of the Associate Dean Student Affairs (ADSA), with the students.”",
      "Earlier this month, the Dean of Student Affairs refused to give an on-record statement toVox Populi, where students wanted to ask questions about the ongoing concerns—many of which are included here.",
      "Multiple changes in the bureaucratic process have made otherwise mundane tasks highly tedious. For example, just to book a lecture hall, the number of permissions have been increased from four to six — the two additions were faculty permits. The earlier system of auto-payment for these bookings has been revoked and seven signatures are now needed to process it. Sounds trivial? Imagine this: you want to take an initiative, organise a lecture, and you are asked to run around for six signatures. Would you even care to take this pain?",
      "The Associate Dean of Students’ Affairs (ADSA), students said, has made demeaning and demotivating comments to various student functionaries at multiple occasions: “What will you get out of organizing this festival”; “Will you get any personal gains out of this”; “You will not get placed if you argue like this”; “what is this students’ senate. We will follow what will be decided in DoSA Office”, and more. This is unbecoming of a faculty member.",
      "On top of this, when students sent resolutions to the Director expressing concerns about the ADSA and other issues including a disputed order by the SSAC, it was forwarded back to the Student Affairs office, which, expectedly, just sat on it. This is in a marked difference from just three years back when student resolutions were given due regard and seriously discussed in the Academic senate. It clearly shows student opinion on matters directly concerning students is increasingly being disregarded.",
      "To be sure, there are many problems on the students’ side. For one, the student body was not able to elect the President of the Students’ Gymkhana in the current academic year. Festivals have been mismanaged, and the budget deficit is a big concern. Theunethical practices in the 2019 Gymkhana general electionand thelatest mishap in the freshers nightdon’t reflect well on the student community. The institute continues to carry the baggage of a “culture” enmeshed with toxic masculinity, bullying and abuse.",
      "It’s not the current students alone who are to blame for this: we, the alumni, were very much a part of this culture, and did little to change it — even after recognising this is not okay.",
      "We acknowledge these problems. But the solutions do not lie in curbing student freedom. Students need to be treated like adults and their opinions need to be respected. Period.",
      "It is crucial to recognise that the administration and students are not equal parties in this brewing conflict. There is a clear hierarchy of power. The administration enjoys coercive powers in the Institute that can affect a student’s life on campus and career thereafter.",
      "The first step to solve a problem is to acknowledge it. That seems to be lacking. Itappearsthat the highest position holders, including the Director, believe that things are largely fine: it’s thenegative PR in the media that needs to be tackled, they think.",
      "But they are missing the point: there won’t be negative news if the Institute doesn’t screw up. The administration needs to come out of the delusion of a glorious past and see things for what it is. IIT Kanpur has continuously slipped in university rankings. It remains behind all the older IITs in MHRD’s NIRF rankings. Ours was the only old IIT which did not get the coveted Institute of Eminence status, government’s flagship program of creating world-class institutions.",
      "The status quo needs to change. We are not cynical about the state of the Institute and its future. But we are genuinely concerned over the incidents over the last few years, and the direction in which the Institute is moving doesn’t make us optimistic. We need to act. Fast, and now.",

Freshers, a competition organised by Antaragni and Media and Cultural (MnC) Council comprises of three stages: an elimination round based on nomination forms, followed by interviews with the organizing team, and a final on-stage performance in a pageant-like manner. During the final round, a finalist was asked by one of the judges to present a dialogue in a “seductive”  tone. Given the occasion, setting and the behaviour of the crowd, the appropriateness of the task is questionable. For someone who is just 20 days into the campus, standing under the spotlight in front of an audience of 1000 odd people already riled up, a question like this could be intimidating. She indeed says, “It was really embarrassing and I don’t want it to happen again.”",
      "For such events, prior communication between the organisers and the candidates is important. Mr Divyansh Verma- Festival Coordinator, Antaragni, one of the judges of the event, argued that the participants were well informed that they might be asked to perform embarrassing tasks for the final round. However, the statement seems to be unconvincing as his fellow Core Team Member Shreya Surabhi went on record to say that the participants denied any such communication. Further, one of the finalists differed with Divyansh on this point as well. The task in question involved the finalists to say a movie dialogue with emotions ranging sharply from love, disgust, anger, sadness to finally seduction. To this, Divyansh ambiguously replied, “She was not asked to seduce the audience using expressions but only to say the dialogue seductively.” This argument that only bodily expressions can qualify as derogatory and verbal statements cannot, is condemnable. He further added, “Had the same task been given to a male student or had the setting been different, it would not have been considered offensive. It was due to the unruliness of the crowd that the whole scene got sexualized”.",
      "Divyansh agreed that what happened shouldn’t have been the case and that both him and the Officiating General Secretary, Media and Culture, the other judge of the event, had apologized to the participant the very same day. According to the participant, the General Secretary visited her later and apologised if she was hurt in some way. But later on, added that “It was not a big mistake anyway.”",
      "Adding on to this chain of events, a mail that informed the participants of their selection for Mr and Ms Freshers’ final round was sent by Team Antaragni along with an embedded sheet containing remarks based on their preliminary auditions. Ranging from sexist slurs to linguistic discrimination and body shaming, the sheet is self-explanatory and extricates Vox of otherwise establishing the sexist nature of the Freshers’ night events as described afore.",
      "",
      "The remarks are embarrassing as they stand, but we could not go on without mentioning a few. “Sirf Sundar, uninteresting” for a girl student, “English nahi aati”and“Patla wala launda, Chakka”so to state. It is extremely disappointing that these comments come from the flag bearers and representatives of IITK’s media and culture.",
      "Mr Maulik Khanna, Head Events and Competitions, Antaragni’19 confidently claimed that,“the sheet when sent via mail did not contain any derogatory remarks”and that they were added by someone anonymous.He argues on the basis of the edit history of the sheet, which has now been deleted by the Antaragni team. On the contrary, one of the Freshers who received the sheet along with the mail confided that the sheet did not have edit access and that the remarks were already there before the Freshers’ night performances began. Since the sheet has been deleted, there is no way to verify that the remarks were added by anonymous people or if they were added by Team Antaragni.",
      "When asked if the comments were sexist, Maulik added that one of the remarks“aurat”for a certain Fresher could have been“sexist”in the hindsight, but wasn’t“inappropriate”since it was based on the fact that the person performed“mujra”as a part of his act. This thought process raises concerns, given that Antaragni caters to a variety of communities. While sending the sheet along with the mail was a mistake from the Antaragni team, the outlook of the judges is detestable.",
      "During the entire course of events of the Freshers’ Night, there was constant hooting and rash comments were being made by the audience which discouraged the performers even before they started performing on stage. The remarks passed ranged from loud abusive noises to sexist statements. Screenshots show the members of a certain club planning to disrupt the performance of another club even before the performances started. Antaragni again comes at the behest as for them the winning criteria would be the amount of hooting received. An event, that hinges on an “embarrassing task” as the final round and decides the winners based on hooting, raises concerns about the ideologies of the show-runners. It is for us to ponder if we wish this to continue.",
      "",
      "“I had prepared something else for the event, but seeing the nature of the crowd and the expectation of the seniors, I felt that this might be the culture of IIT Kanpur and this must be the routine every year. Had I known this before, I would have never participated in the event,’’ says the finalist under discussion. For someone who’s hardly a month old here, statements like these demonstrate the effect such events can have mentally and how we’re highly irresponsible in caring about every element of such events.",
      "The people and the interactions freshers experience, shape their thoughts and characters greatly. It is the responsibility of the campus community to ensure that this step of transition from a naive, immature adult to an educated and opinionated person who stands for the correct, happens the right way. Freshers’ Night, being the introductory event serves as a platform for freshers to showcase their talents and to bond through a bunch of opportunities. Hence, proper conduction of Freshers’ Night is integral to the development of a fresher. A number of individuals are responsible for this, and seeing people who’ve been under the scrutiny of strict disciplinary actions before in the judging and organizing team of such an important event raises serious questions about the appointment of such organisers. Promotion of something condemnable which can and has acted as a discouragement for freshers as a judging criterion is questionable and needs reconsideration. Leaving aside all our debates over the fabledculture, we have to realize that the objective of these events is to make the people who we in jest call “bachhas”, feel welcome to this one great family. Each of the elements of such an event needs to be weighed for their consequences. And this time around we have miserably failed as a community.",
      "Edit: A statement from Mr Maulik Khanna which was slightly misquoted has been edited. We are apologetic for any inconvenience caused to him or anyone else. For any further grievances contact the editorial board.",

      "Disclaimer: This is an opinion piece by Ms Archana Singh on the current state of electoral politics on campus. The facts and statements mentioned in this article are based on her interactions with current students and recent alumni on campus.",
      "The 2019 Gymkhana Elections witnessed a series of electoral malpractices. The violations by candidates included mass phone calls to students on voting day, attempts to garner votes on community lines, usage of official machinery for electoral gains and collusion among the candidates.",
      "When the violations were brought forth, a complaint was filed with the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC). The GRC is a five-membered committee, comprising three student and two faculty members, that looks into any concerns related to an election that is raised before it. The committee acted upon the complaint filed and collected evidence to conduct a detailed investigation. Four weeks after the complaint was filed, the GRC took several strong actions, most notably cancelling the elections for the post of President Student’s Gymkhana and General Secretary, Media and Culture.",
      "The violations were serious. But they are not new. “Such incidents occur every election and nullification of election results and candidature have taken place in previous elections as well”, says Ayush Pathak, who served as the Chief Election Officer in 2016-17 and who has closely witnessed five General Elections.",
      "Elections to the student bodies ideally ought to be a healthy contest of ideas and visions that provide popular representation to the student community and improve their lives on the campus. Malpractices of the sort witnessed this election turn candidates’ attention away from real issues. The manifesto, which is supposed to be the focus of the campaign, faces the risk of being reduced to a mere formality. A vicious cycle has been set up that either compels well-meaning candidates to drift away from ethical conduct to stay in the race; or causes people to refrain from taking part in the democratic process altogether. This has been witnessed in the past few elections where positions are either won uncontested, or the contests frequently take an ugly turn.",
      "Top offices in the Students’ Gymkhana are very lucrative posts. Candidates aspiring to occupy these positions start their preparations many months in advance. “Executive Posts in the Gymkhana bring with them the power to create an impact on campus. They are also seen as a status symbol and add great value to one’s resume”, adds Amit Ranjan, a Y14 alumnus and Institute Leadership Awardee. The desire to get ahead of one’s rivals and win the election makes candidates willing to gain advantages by sacrificing their commitment to the code of conduct. Votes are sought and cast on the basis of “hall feelings”. HEC members participate in such measures to ensure that they get support from the Gymkhana. Some even do so to improve their own political prospects. Candidates also cater to voting blocs that exist on clubs sports teams and even community grounds. Identities end up taking precedence over issues.",
      "The lack of attention given to pertinent issues during the election campaign carries forward into governance. “The Students’ Senate takes up issues which are relevant only to a limited number of people on campus. It spends most of its time discussing fests like Antaragni, Techkriti and events like E-Summit and General Championships. Issues related to student welfare are relegated to the back seat”, opines Aditya Desai, a two-term PhD Y14 senator.",
      "Post Graduate students, who make about half of the student population on campus, feel their issues are neglected and find participating in the student body futile. A resident of Hall XI, who did not wish to be named, shares his account: “The Gymkhana hasn’t been able to resolve the crisis in Hall XI for the past two years. The hall has been running without a constitution since its inception and there is a continuous conflict between the Hall Wardens and the residents”.",
      "There is an air of dissatisfaction among the undergraduate students with the way things function within the system. “I vote in every election but mostly for NOTA. People are occupying posts only for narrow self-interests. They take up a position only to use it as a stepping stone to a higher position, neglecting their current responsibilities. It’s not the most competent, but the most politically willing people that end up in the Senate and the Gymkhana. Awards and appointment to committees are decided on the basis of networks and connections. Vox too has failed in holding student representatives accountable and that has also contributed to the state of affairs.”, fiercely argues Sayash Kapoor, a final-year undergraduate student.",
      "On the issue of participation of girls in the elections, Mugdha Arora, a candidate for the post of General Secretary, Games and Sports in the 2018 Elections, says, “As an institution, we do not groom girls to make viable candidates. While boys can openly display ambitions and get mentorship and exposure from their seniors, girls are unable to even aspire to get into leadership positions as they lack a similar support structure.”",
      "In 2019, we complete 60 years as an institute. At this critical juncture, we as a student body must pause, introspect and correct course. IIT Kanpur is celebrated for the voice and freedom it offers to its students. Credible student leadership is vital to the survival of this freedom. Resolutions passed by the Students’ Senate carry weight in front of institute authorities. The Students’ Senate’s nominees to institute committees play an important role in putting forth the voices of the student community. Student representatives having the confidence of the General Student Body is necessary for them to be taken seriously by the administration. The current state of affairs, in which we are drifting away from principles that lie at the core of student governance, endanger the very freedoms we so cherish. We, as a student community, must get our act together before the administration starts questioning our ability to be responsible and finds a reason to dilute our say on crucial issues concerning us.",

      "Ayan Roychowdhury joined as a masters student at IIT Kanpur and pursued his Ph.D. here itself, his stay spanning eight years. He completed his schooling from a government public school in his hometown Barasat and did his bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Jadavpur University. Currently, he is pursuing his postdoc at ESPCI, Paris",
      "I grew up in the suburbs of Kolkata in a traditional Bengali brahmin joint family which had moved out of my ancestral home in Bangladesh during the political turmoil of the 1940s. The formative years of my sexuality were markedly different than my cousins and childhood friends. I was effeminate, but being raised in a conservative family meant there was a constant pressure to behave like a stereotypical boy.",
      "My initial encounters with ‘homosexuality’ originated when I was around 10 years old. My first exposure was through newspaper articles about a then-controversial movie ‘Fire’ directed by Deepa Mehta. Besides this, a significant part of information came from the movies of the late Rituparno Ghosh, an openly transgender director from Kolkata, who addressed issues of homosexuality and gender roles in their movies.",
      "",
      "Still unsure of my own sexuality, I came physically close to one of my cousin brothers at home, who was three years older to me. It started as a sexual play born out of mutual curiosity and evolved into a long relationship of adolescent attraction engulfing almost all of my teenage years. Nothing concrete became of it, however, and years down the line it’s still awkward and sour between us. The gradual understanding of my own sexuality deepened in high school when I had a crush on some boys. Yet, during my college years at Jadavpur University, I stumbled into a relationship with a girl I met there. While she was my girlfriend, I couldn’t bring myself to like her the way I liked men. Concurrently, I fell for a guy in my batch and couldn’t stop myself from advancing towards him. We texted daily at night for almost eight months till I ended up confessing my feelings to him on my 20th birthday. The confession freaked him out and he immediately ended our friendship.",
      "During this difficult period, I started questioning the dilemma of my sexuality head-on. It was frustrating to live a double life. A part of me wanted to forget my identity and adopt the heteronormative structure of the society, while the other couldn’t find itself to bring about a change. It was never a choice. After completing our graduation from JU, both of us (me and my girlfriend) joined IITK for our masters. This was my first time away from home, leaving memories of the complicated relationships in the past.",
      "At IIT Kanpur, I suddenly found myself in a relatively open and free environment with tremendous resources like unlimited internet at hand. During the beginning of the first semester, as a part of one of the course assignments, I poured my heart out in a letter I wrote to the guy I loved in JU. As fate would have it, I mistakenly ended up sending it on the class mailing list.",
      "While many of my IITK batch mates, including the instructor, read it and appreciated it over its ‘grammatical/literary content’, My identity was no longer hidden from my girlfriend. Eventually, she came to an understanding and became the first who I ‘came out’ to in my life. She was shattered to pieces after that revelation. It shook her as bad that she abandoned herself in her hostel room to cry for days. It ripped me apart too, witnessing the situation.",
      "Not able to move forward with the emotional breakdown, we resorted to the Counselling Service for help. For the first time, I narrated my story to a complete stranger, the counselor Pratibha Mishra who then worked for the CS. The counseling and the antidepressant prescription proved helpful for both of us to temporarily overcome our mental situation. After some time, we gradually started interacting again—the ‘moving on’ phase— as she tried to come around the fact that I was not heterosexual. It was at this point in life when I decided that I couldn’t lead that double life anymore, and came out to a few of my undergraduate batchmates and close friends from Kolkata.",
      "Much to my surprise, while almost all of them naturally condemned me for my insensitive action, a very few encouraged me and supported me. Later, I found one of my closest childhood friends to be homosexual. This came at a time when it was still a taboo, and nobody wanted to talk about it. Eventually, I met a few more friends from my undergrad batch in JU who had joined IITK for masters. I came out to them as well. They supported me, and our interactions gradually transitioned away from the “taboos” surrounding homosexuality.",
      "After a while, I gathered courage and wrote a detailed Facebook post about my sexuality and came out to hundreds of people online. My friends and batchmates received it quite well lest for one or two people who made derogatory comments. Subsequently, I became very active on social media. It kept me updated about LGBTQ+ communities and forums across the world. I also started exploring gay dating websites and met new people there.",
      "It was through one of these websites that I was introduced to Manish, an IITK alumnus, who was open about his identity and had contacts in many support groups. He also introduced me to Amrita, another alum. They were in touch with many LGBTQ-activists, and I started reading about queer politics. They introduced me to their new initiative, UNMUKT, which they envisaged to be a support and discussion forum addressing gender and sexual diversity in the larger IITK community.",
      "A while later, I started dating a student in campus, Vivek. All four of us, with another friend Sandeep, hung out frequently, often joined by our friends from other political awareness forums in the campus, like ‘Humara Manch’ and ‘IITK Forum for Critical Thinking’, addressing various other community-related issues of IIT Kanpur. I found many of them echoing with our own idea of queer activism. We also very actively organized and participated in discussions about issues relating to gender roles and the heteronormative structure of our society. It was a time when many like-minded people came together to address and understand the larger problems prevalent in our society originating from the oppressive caste and class system in India. I am glad that I got introduced to Prof. Suchitra Mathur. She was always filled with enthusiasm to talk about these issues. We would spend hours together discussing queer and feminist politics and envisioned formation of a platform where we could freely discuss these societal structures which dictate us to lead our lives in a certain a heteronormative way and outcaste people who don’t align with it.",
      "As a consequence of our vision,Unmuktwas born in 2013. It was based on the lines of an existing platform Saathi in IIT-B and Queer IISc in Bangalore.",
      "Through my personal experiences, I have learned that every kind of discrimination originates from a basic structure of society. It nurtures prejudices and stereotypes against anyone who won’t fit their ideal image and role of a man and a woman. Gradually, we expanded the horizons of our discussion to look at a much bigger picture leading it to what Unmukt stands for presently. Every individual needs to come forward for the cause. It is essential for us to understand that this problem is neither unique nor limited to the LGBTQ+ community, and cannot be eradicated if we do not take collective action.",

    "title": "Are Open Electives that Open?",
    "date": "2025-07-03T11:08:59+05:30",
    "date_text": "July 3, 2025",
    "authors": [],
    "content": [
      "IIT Kanpur is considered as one of the most flexible academic institutes in India and abroad with offerings such as double majors, minors and loads of electives. The Open Electives (OEs) are a crucial part of this freedom. They act as means to pursue inter-departmental courses which count towards the degree in one’s own major.",
      "In theory, one can take any course that is offered at IITK as an OE of his/her choice but as with most unbelievable things, there are terms and conditions involved making OEs more of a fuss than a facility. Read through as Vox delves deeper into these terms and conditions applied over OEs to figure out whether OEs are really that open?",
      "The first and foremost issue with the OE system lies in the scarcity of TAs and faculty members for a particular course. Most of our interviewees agreed upon the restraint due to a limited number of Teaching Assistants (TAs) in a department. Both Prof Vimal Kumar of Department of Economic Sciences and Prof. Devlina Chatterjee of Department of IME agreed that lack faculty members in the departments are a hindrance to increasing student intake in OE courses. Prof. Devlina added that in some courses she needs one to one interaction that is not possible otherwise.",
      "This might be a worrying trend as the number of students has been increasing gradually since the turn of the decade or so while the number of faculty has remained almost constant, as claimed by the previous Chairperson, Students’ Senate, Mr Kunal Kapila. Further, up to 15% percent of the supernumerary seats will be added next year for female students as well, as per the recently passed MHRD policy and this might worsen the existing situation.",
      "Prof Harish Karnick of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering gave his two cents on the topic from the perspective of a larger department. He pointed out that these departments bear a heavy load from institute core (IC) courses like ESC101 that run every semester and ask for a huge number of TAs. While he was indifferent towards the number of students in a class, he did bring out the problems faced in grading and monitoring a large class with a limited number of TAs.",
      "While there might be a scarcity of faculty, IIT Kanpur does boast of a very healthy post-graduate to undergraduate ratio with an almost equal percentage at this point. This further raises the doubt as to why there exists a scarcity of TAs for many courses. Prof Neeraj Misra, the Dean of Academic Affairs (DOAA) shed light upon the matter by adding the fact that despite having many PG students on the campus, making everybody a tutor/TA remains a utopian situation. There is a proper selection procedure through which a Ph.D. or PG student goes before being given the responsibility. However, to help the case better, after a recent Senate proposal, TAs are now allowed to grade sheets unloading some burden off the Professors.",
      "Moving forward and accepting that there can’t be unlimited seats in a course, the secondary issue pertains to the students themselves, that is, their attitude towards OEs. The general perception of the teaching community (at least our interviewees) towards students, especially UGs, is that of money-mindedness, which affects their willingness to enrol. Prof Vimal felt that many students just want non-technical courses for good placement opportunities rather than a genuine interest in the topic which leads to restriction of allotting courses to everyone who is interested. Prof Devlina also resents the “UG attitude” and feels the same is evident from low attendance statistics of UG students in the courses opposed to that of PGs and MBA students. She further added, “We are not here to give the B.Tech students an easier path to better jobs. IME department doesn’t exist for this reason, IME department exists to serve and cater the teaching and research needs of IME students. We give some courses to B.Tech students as a courtesy. You are not our department students. Every department has its loyalty to its own students first and then it has loyalty to rest of institute.”",
      "As the demand for some courses is more than the others, professors then need to apply some metric they find suitable, which might not seem fair to all students. DOAA accepted the fact that every metric has its faults and for course allocation there has to be a criterion and instructions so as to fairly allocate a course. The decision though lies with the instructor, hence the filter is not common. He also felt that more open electives should be offered which have no or a minimum number of prerequisites so as to increase its reach to a larger number of students.",
      "Prof. Rajiv Shekhar (former SUGC Chairperson) highlighted that CPI remains a common yardstick upon which students are tested upon and hence greatly limits the choices for an average student, though there are several deviations from this standard policy. Further, it came out that as an alternative to CPI sometimes professors randomly pick the students, while first-come-first-serve is always an open option. Some students reach out to faculty members for getting a particular course expressing their interest in that which is dealt in different ways by different professors. Prof Vimal Kumar believes that it is an asymmetrical decision for anyone to make as it is tough to make out who is genuinely interested and who is faking it. Hence in this situation, he prefers one who has done a verified project or an internship in that particular area stands. On the contrary, Prof. Devlina doesn’t give much heed to project work as she thinks that they can easily be approved.",
      "“It would be better if Professors also state the policy that they’ll use to allocate open electives on Pingala as otherwise, one has to go to 4-5 course instructors to ensure you get that one OE, making pre-registration period a hectic time, even more so as it is very close to end-sems,” exclaimed Sirsendu Sarkar, a third-year undergrad.",
      "Another major issue is the existence of prerequisites for almost every course, which renders courses inaccessible to students who are genuinely interested in the coursework. In theory, a prerequisite waiver can be obtained with the permission of the course instructor. However, as Prannay Khosla (Y15, CSE), narrates, “If you want to get prerequisites waived it wasn’t possible earlier. In my second year, the DoAA staff refused to cooperate even after the course instructor gave permission. However, once Pingala was launched, I was able to get prerequisites waived and the DoAA office didn’t intervene.” The same issue was reiterated by Robin Singh Rana, Y15, BS MTH. He adds, “Data Structures and Algorithms (ESO 207) is a compulsory ESO for my department which we need to do in our 5th semester as per our departmental template. Hence we were not given that course by course instructors earlier, neither in 3rd semester nor during summers, even though the departmental template is not binding. Due to this, I was not able to take up OEs of my choice from CSE department until my 6th semester. Though I have had done relevant certified online courses, instructors were unwilling to consider the same.” A major hurdle in being able to do OEs of interest is the problem of numerous time slot clashes. Prannay will not be able to register for two OEs of his interest (Commutative Algebra and Principles of Programming Languages) because he needs to complete his ESO credits and the courses clash with ESO slots. Clashes with basket DEs, departmental compulsory courses and HSS slots are almost invariably common woes faced by students during pre-registration.",
      "Now we shall discuss the solutions that can possibly help or improve the present situation, which, the DOAA agrees, is not optimal yet. The first and obvious choice is flipped classroom. This not only eliminates the need for infrastructure that otherwise might pose problems but also frees up the instructor from taking lectures in the subsequent years hence freeing up the time to invest in correcting copies or making better assignments. Prof Vimal Kumar hinted that his department is looking into this as a viable option. Prof Karnick, on the contrary, felt that the time involved in making the material is excessive. Prof. Devlina seemed to agree to it’s potential but felt its effectiveness to be limited to only project-oriented courses.",
      "Another solution as proposed by Prof. Devlina was that of a generic introductory course by the department with higher student intake, something similar to what is employed by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in form of the course, Data Structures and Algorithms that admits in excess of 150 students for one semester in a year. The recent proposal passed in the Academic Senate to have merit-based undergraduate TAs will definitely help in increasing the number of TAs for popular courses. An innovative new solution to copy checking is posed by using tools like Gradescope, employed by Prof Indranil Saha in ESC101 and Prof. Purushottam Kar in CS771, both having in excess of 200 students. Gradescope helps in creating templates that can correct copies once uploaded to it by scanning or documents, hence making the process at least simpler than before.",

      "This is an opinion piece by Samarth Bansal, IIT Kanpur alumnus and former Chief Editor of Vox Populi who graduated in 2015. The views conveyed in the article are solely of the author. The opinion section of Vox Populi provides a platform for the campus junta to voice their opinions.",
      "Browsing through my LinkedIn feed on Saturday afternoon, I came across this post:",
      "“We are honored to have Mr.Yogi Adityanath as our Chief guest for Startup Master Class 2018 @ IIT Kanpur on 27-28th Jan, 2018.”",
      "To be sure, I read it again: Startup Master Class, an initiative of the IIT Kanpur Alumni Association, which aims to “foster and nurture budding entrepreneurs, bring together startups, mentors and investors to build interactions and strengthen the network within the entrepreneurial community”, has invited Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, as Chief Guest of the event.",
      "Let’s understand what it really means: a priest-turned-politician, a firebrand Hindu cleric, who rose to power by spiking divisive rhetoric, by making sure that the communal politics stays alive in this country, has been invited as the Chief Guest of a flagship entrepreneurship event.",
      "In words of Pratap Bhanu Mehta, one of the foremost public intellectuals in India and now the Vice-Chancellor of Ashoka University, Yogi “is widely regarded as the single most divisive, abusive, polarising figure in UP politics. He is a politician who has, for most of his political career, been the mascot of militant Hindu sectarianism, reactionary ideas, routinised conflict and thuggery in political discourse, and an ecosystem where the vilest legitimations of violence are not far away.”",
      "This man, the organisers of this event believe, is suited to be the Chief Guest of this mega entrepreneurship event. I am astonished by their judgement. Sure, he is the Chief Minister of the state where the campus is located. But don’t the organisers find any contradiction between the idea behind the entrepreneurship event and the politics of Yogi, which espouses muscular  Hindu nationalism?",
      "Entrepreneurship and innovation are key to solve some of the major challenges that this country — and the world — is facing. But Yogi’s world view is antithetical to the stated goals of startups and incompatible with progress, prosperity and change, which innovative entrepreneurship aims to promote. Inviting him to this event is not only disturbing, but ironic.",
      "The description of UP Chief Minister in the preceding paragraphs is not an interpretation: Yogi wears his politics up to his sleeves and advocates it vehemently. His rabble-rousing hate speeches are publicly available on YouTube. Given a chance, he said, he would install statues of Goddess Gauri, Ganesh and Nandi in every mosque. In 2015, during the ‘rising intolerance’ debate, he compared Shahrukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed. More in this video:",

      "Lest my argument be misunderstood, note two points.",
      "First, I am not arguing that IIT Kanpur should make a political statement by not allowing Yogi to enter the campus on any occasion—far from it. Someday, say, the Uttar Pradesh government plans to set up a new lab or a research park at IIT Kanpur, it is but obvious that Yogi, the head of this government, should be the one to launch it. But that’s not the case here. This is an independent event, where there was no official obligation to invite the CM.",
      "Second, it’s not about right-wing politics in general—as I am sure some would have already painted my case as an ideological argument. Yogi is not just another politician. He is afringepolitician, an extremist, who is under investigation for inciting religious hatred and rioting. Account for that difference.",
      "So is that it that the organisers believe that as long as the larger goal of the success of the event is met — the presence of CM would definitely help get sponsors, media coverage, and more — his personality and past record don’t matter at all? If they think so, it’s really unfortunate.",
      "And even then, what credentials does Yogi otherwise have to be a good choice as Chief Guest at this event? Unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who as Chief Minister of Gujarat had initiated business-friendly reforms, Yogi has no record to showcase.",
      "Let me be clear here: I am proud of what the E-Cell has achieved in the current decade. Current students won’t even know what went into setting up this organisation. I poignantly remember E-Cell’s first session in 2011, held in L-7, when I was a fresher. Not more than ten students attended that introductory lecture. Talking about entrepreneurship was an oddity.",
      "But that was then. In 2015, the year when I graduated, E-Cell had grown exponentially. This is a result of a sustained effort by successive E-Cell teams, cutting across batches.",
      "As someone who has closely observed this rise — my efforts were mostly directed towards building a community of startup enthusiasts and knowledge sharing through campus hangouts and lectures — I consider the invitation to Yogi a big low in this stupendous journey.",
      "To get some perspective, I spoke to a couple of students (current and former members associated with E-Cell) and asked what do they think (in their personal capacity and not as representatives of the club) are the potential justifications for Yogi’s invitation. The first student said it would be good to expose him to the various expectations that young students and future entrepreneurs have from their leader. The second one said that as Chief Minister when he gets to know some problems first hand, he can contribute to the progress of the institute and the startup ecosystem.",
      "In the first reading, these appear to be legitimate reasons. But in practice, both are just theoretical constructs. In my view, these arguments are not strong enough to outweigh the concerns I have highlighted.",
      "Let me bring up one more issue. There is no doubt that the Startup Master Class has an excellent speaker line-up. But one fact is striking: of the32 speakerslisted in the programme schedule, there is just one woman. One out of thirty-two—this is worse than the already poor student sex ratio of the campus. How tragic. Were any efforts made to fix this imbalance? I don’t know. But to console myself, I would like to believe that the organisers at least acknowledge that this is a problem and have noted that in future events, they will have a better mix — say at least 25-30% women to begin with, as compared to 3% this time.",
      "But well, this gender imbalance might not even be an issue for our Chief Guest. In an essay published on Yogi’s website (now deleted,archive copy here), theCM saidthat women need male protection from birth to death and their ‘energy/power’ should be regulated or controlled, lest it become worthless and destructive. This is the man who will give the keynote address at India’s best engineering college to encourage entrepreneurship. I have nothing more to say.",

      "Dear Antaragni core team,",
      "Hope you have recovered from the euphoria of having conducted the most awaited calendar event in IIT Kanpur. Congratulations on inviting some of the biggest names in entertainment industry! But in doing so, respecting the intellectual property of a fellow student organisation probably slipped low on the priority list.",
      "While walking past the imposing standee displaying the schedule near the pronites ground, something odd caught my notice. I was sure I read ‘Vox’ somewhere on the the banner but I had to pause and scan it to realise what it was. A competition, called ‘Vox Walks’, planned for Antaragni without the Vox Populi team having any knowledge of it! Over the course of the next three days, I was approached by multiple people, mostly Vox team members, curious about its presence. It was not easy trying to convince them that as the Chief Editor of the body, I had no clue why the name ‘Vox’ appeared on the schedule.",
      "",
      "It might seem too trivial an incident to be even given a second thought, but let me explain why I feel otherwise. I take offense to the fact that not just the name of the body, but a specific series (Vox Walks) has been blatantly used without permission. I have no knowledge of how the event was conducted, who judged the entries or if it even saw the light of the day. What I do know, however, is that the reputation of an organisation I lead was in the hands of individuals who did not find it appropriate to take consent before using its name. While discussing this, a friend of mine casually commented that it would reflect badly if the event is not judged fairly. To be honest, this was the least of my concerns. Since our success as a journalism body depends heavily on how our readers perceive us, I was more worried about how the participants were treated. An act like not distributing prizes (something Antaragni is infamous for!) would forever tarnish our image, for no fault of ours. I am not sure if the people who thought of including the event are aware of the concept of ‘Vox Walks’. Since it involves talking to random people, any number of issues could have come up regarding inappropriate interactions. Only time will tell if my fears come true or not.",
      "Next, let me talk about something that probably hits closer to home for you. I take my role of a mentor and a team leader seriously and that is the second reason why I find this incident so disturbing. As student organisations, Vox Populi or Antaragni do not exist for the sole purpose of publishing articles or organising a cultural festival. They also carry the responsibility of enriching students with qualities which are expected of the leaders and influencers of tomorrow. As the senior most members of the team, the onus is upon us to ensure it happens. By letting such an incident occur, you have implicitly sent out the signal to future generations of core team members that it is acceptable to not respect the intellectual property of others. In the confines of our campus, it might be brushed under the carpet or go unnoticed but it definitely will not be the case outside.",
      "I sincerely hope that after reading this letter you will introspect and appreciate the responsibility you shoulder when organising an event of this magnitude.",
      "Sincerely,",
      "Simrat Singh"

The opinion section of Vox Populi provides a platform for the campus junta to voice their opinions.This entry on the topic ‘IITs: Passion or a Social Pressure’ received the third prize in the freshers’ writing competition.",
      "“Beta, life set ho jaegi…”We all have heard one or the other variation of this expression. We have heard it a lot.",
      "As soon as the news of our JEE preparation spreads, plenty of family members, neighbours, every random family friend and all the relatives that exist only during the exam result declaration period, constantly tap the doors and windows of our head and then smack it with these lines.",
      "It is just like one taps an egg against a bowl to crack it open and then mix it all to make omelette.",
      "We are, most of us, converted into such omelette. Just like the beaten egg, our brains are all turned topsy turvy and delusional by our dear society. Not to mention the overcooking in the social pressure cooker.",
      "Most of us have studied endlessly for two­-three years. Blindly. Dedicated major chunks of the 24 hours that we so fondly converted into a pie chart only to use as the tissue paper after eating samosas while cursing every other trigonometry problem. All this cursing and blindly working just because ‘they’ told us that this is a great career path. True it is. But by being blind, we never asked “Why do I want it?”, or “Will the fattest package that I am told I need really satisfy me?”, or “Is this decision really mine?”",
      "Most of us never had time for such introspection because ‘The Monkeys’ were hanging on each others tail in ‘Concepts of Physics’ and it was our duty to address this issue of utmost importance.",
      "We must realise how twisted this tale of IIT entrance exams is.",
      "“Oh, you committed a silly mistake in the practice test? And fixed it? Cool. Thats great! But…Sharmila Aunty kya kahengi if you dont get in the IIT’s due to such silly mistakes?” So many of us have this add on fear of what if I do not get a good enough rank?… Still the main concern is not the ‘not­ as­ expected ­rank’, but what will ‘they’ think of my not ­so­ good­ rank.",
      "The social pressure is immense. If happiness is a sunny day in a beautiful hill station with birds chirping in the deep blue sky, then such insane pressure is raining cats and dogs at the same place coupled with some chocolatey landslides that drag you along.",
      "The IIT tag, is really over hyped in our society. Yes, IITs do offer really incredible opportunities and after coming here, pretty much nobody regrets the lack of clarity of their passion, but the social pressure that many people face in the process is not justifiable.",
      "Many people get into IITs just for the sake of it, many people opt for a branch that they have no interest in only because it’s an IIT and society will think highly of them for being an IITian.",
      "“Cool. You say that you love what you do? But…whats your branch’s average and highest package?”",
      "“Oh, you made it to IIT? Which branch are you doing Btech from? So…you mean not B-tech? (makes poker face and leaves).”",
      "“Wow, you have such a good rank. So where are you taking Computer Science?”",
      "So often it happens that people who want to study basic sciences and go for research are demotivated and they don’t go for what they really want to do. Society has kind of primed us to get a job quick and make loads of money, money enough to use the Rs. 1000 bills as tissue papers after eating samosa.",
      "Many people are like “Oh, so they have a BS programme also in IIT?”",
      "And we fall for such people who live in their own world and let them influence our passion and path that we follow in life.",
      "People do say that IIT is not the end of life. But pretty much everywhere the same people say, after a time interval of about 1 hour, 13 minutes and 11 seconds, that, “IIT nikaal lo…beta, life set ho jaegi.” And on top of that they create an environment that makes us feel that IIT is the ultimate aim of life and for however short the interval might be, a thought does cross the mind that maybe he was just joking when he said that IIT is not the end of life.",
      "The matter is really serious, there are plethora of cases when people just have had enough of the social pressure and it all explodes. When they really cannot take it anymore and they decide to end it for once and for all, saying very often “I failed you.” or “I could not make it.”",
      "All because they were made to think that it is a really gargantuan thing that they are working on. Once you fall into this pressure, there is no escape, there is no reason behind it, it’s just a circular argument meant to make you go haywire.",
      "But even amidst such dark and mostly pointless abyss of social pressure, there are some people who remain really passionate and dazzled by the exciting opportunities that they will get in an IIT in a field of their choice.",
      "They pursue what they really want to. No matter if that gets him in the Guinness book of world records for witnessing 1000 unique weird faces people make on hearing his choice of higher studies.",
      "Such people really want to do something and make a difference. And all this does not require any external stimuli, it’s just the ‘antaragni’ they have.",
      "One can argue that getting into IITs really needs passion and dedication. Passion to be at ‘THE PLACE TO BE’ and dedication to make it. It is indeed true. But that passion mostly ends after the exam, no matter what the result.",
      "It is a really fuzzy boundary between IITs being a symbol of passion or them being the symbol of drudgey and social furnace that the students endure. But the recent trends clearly show that IITs mostly represent the latter.",
      "Test it yourself, the words IIT and IITian. What does it bring to mind? Most probably it is something like ‘a great package’, ‘good social status’, ‘easy life in the future’, ‘great matrimonial prospects’ or something similar, and in less numbers something like ‘a researcher’, ‘the guy who is changing the world’, ‘the person who studied hard for JEE only because he wants to really study more’ and so on.",
      "This bias is the output of our all time favourite criteria for checking if our choice is right­ society and social pressure, the evil within.",

      "The following is anopinion piecebyBhawesh Kumar, a Y14 undergraduate student from the Department of Physics . The author shares his concerns about the future of BS programs offered by Department of Physics and Chemistry at IIT Kanpur. The views conveyed in the article are solely of the author. The opinion section of Vox Populi provides a platform for the campus junta to voice their opinions",
      "IIT Kanpur was first among the IITs to initiate programs in Basic Sciences. The institution realized very early that science and engineering cannot be separated if it was to succeed as a research institution. Keeping this in mind, the Department of Chemistry was established in the early nineteen sixties. This turned out to be a landmark step.  Professor P. Balaram, former director of IISc Bangalore and an alumni of the Department of Chemistry, IIT Kanpur, mentions in one of his speeches that Chemistry department used to carry out the maximum amount of research at IIT Kanpur during his time[1]. Even today the Department of Chemistry has continued to excel in research, accounting for more than 50% of research output of the institute[2]. Similarly, the Department of Physics has been quite successful too. Some of the most successful Physicists in India  have been its alumni. In 2012, professor Ashoke Sen, a string theorist at HRI and an alumnus of the Physics department of IIT Kanpur was awarded the inaugural edition of the Fundamental Physics Prize, the most lucrative prize in Physics, carrying a prize money of $3 million. The BBC described him as ‘India’s million-dollar scientist'[3]. When Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics was announced for detection of Gravitational Waves recently, as many as seven alumni of the institute figured among those sharing the prize[4].",
      "IIT Kanpur has been traditionally the first choice of students for studying physics. Many students who had options of studying elsewhere have chosen its Physics program over others. Professor Rajesh Gopakumar, now a string theorist and the director ofICTS-TIFR Bangalore, chose IIT Kanpur for studying physics as an undergraduate. He was ranked first in JEE 1987[5]. This is in contrast to the recent trends where students are increasingly preferring IISc Bangalore and even other IITs for studying Physics. The closing ranks for Engineering Physics program at IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi have been better than that of IIT Kanpur for quite some time now. Last year, a student ranked 26th in JEE advanced decided to choose IIT Kanpur only to later choose IISc Bangalore, whose undergraduate program is only 5 years old (see note 1).",
      "How do we make sense of the changing choices? Why has Mathematics and Scientific Computing remained very competitive, unlike Physics and Chemistry? How will increase in fees at IITs impact the students’ choices? Most importantly, what should we do to attract the right kind of students to our Bachelor of Science programs in Physics and Chemistry? We will try to analyze these issues through this article.",
      "The admission to BS program in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at IIT Kanpur has become very competitive, particularly since last two years. However, programs in Physics, Chemistry and Economics have not witnessed such competition. For example, the closing ranks of Physics, Chemistry and Economics were 2641, 5942 and 2771 respectively in 2015[6], as compared to 1214 for the Mathematics program.  It was a similar story in Mathematics only a few years ago, with the closing rank being 2259 in 2013 and 2781 in 2012[7]. With Computer Science becoming  more popular than ever, students are ready to join the BS program in Mathematics in a hope of doing something which is close to Computer Science. Thus, the competitiveness of the BS program in Mathematics might well be a reflection of increasing popularity of Computer Science program rather than that of Mathematics.",
      "IISc is a 100-year-old institution with a rich  history of excellent research in Basic Sciences as well as Engineering. Prior to 2010, it did not have a UG program. After it started its UG program in 2010, it was only natural that many students would opt for it. IISc admits students to its UG program through multiple exams likeKVPY, JEE Main, JEE Advanced and AIPMT. However, the majority of the students are admitted  to the program based on their rank in KVPY exam[8].Vijyoshi Camporganized for KVPY students is an important event for IISc to introduce its UG program to its potential students. When I attended the Vijyoshi Camp in December 2013, IISc had organized a separate session to introduce its UG program to the students attending the camp. After attending the session, I was so impressed that I declared my father on phone that I was going to join IISc for my undergraduate studies. The lesson here is that IISc utilizes the opportunity provided by the Vijyoshi Camp to make the potential students well informed about its UG program. KVPY is a very selective scholarship program. Students who qualify it almost always do very well in exams like JEE &  AIPMT. Many students make their mind to attend IISc for their UG studies after attending the Vijyoshi Camp.",
      "The UG program at IISc is unique in some aspects. Students admitted to the program take core courses in  Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering and Humanities for first three semesters. After three semesters, students choose their specialization in one of the six offered specializations, namely,  Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Materials and Earth & Environmental Science[9]. As students have already taken core courses in first three semesters, they are in a better position to choose their major. The liberty to choose one’s major is one of the most important reason for the success of the undergraduate program of IISc in attracting some of the best students from across India.",
      "Recent increase in fee at IITs including IIT Kanpur can discourage many students from joining the BS program  at IIT Kanpur, particularly in Physics and Chemistry. The tuition fee charged at IISc Bangalore and IISERs is approximately Rs 10,000 per semester[10][11]. Once recent fee hike at IITs is in place, IIT Kanpur will be charging around ten times more fee for its BS programs than IISc Bangalore and IISERs. This may lead to even more number of students opting for IISc Bangalore over IIT Kanpur.  Moreover, the students may now prefer the newly created IISERs due to the severe disparity in the tuition fee.",
      "Charging huge tuition fee for BS programs in Physics and Chemistry is problematic for another reason. There are less job opportunities for students graduating from these two departments in comparison to other engineering departments and also a lot of students prefer to go for PhD after graduation . Going for a PhD entails a huge cost in terms of lost economic opportunity and personal commitment. Burdening such students with heavy academic fee and education loan will discourage future students from joining these programs. This is undesirable in a situation when programs in Basic Sciences are struggling to attract students due to the overemphasis on Engineering. The IITs and the Government of India should remember that for every student loan-driven American model for higher education, there exists a free of cost German or French model too[12][13][14].",
      "In a situation of a massive hike in fee, the role of banks become important. In this context, the discriminatory attitude of  the State Bank Of India is worrisome.  From 2015, the State Bank Of India has stopped its ‘Scholar Loan’ scheme for the BS students in spite of the fact that students enrolled at IITs pay the same tuition fee irrespective of BS or BT program and are admitted after proving themselves in the same exam. This scheme is a very comprehensive loan scheme that covers almost all aspects of educational expenditure from tuition fee, books, mess bill to laptop etc[15]. The scholar loan is provided to students from selected academic institutions like IITs, IIMs, NITs etc on very easy terms. It should be a matter of concern for IIT Kanpur, if a part of its student community who need such loans are not able to get them only because they choose to study Science and not Engineering.",
      "IIT Kanpur will have to make sincere efforts if it is interested in attracting right kind of students for its BS programs, particularly in Physics and Chemistry. The immediate concern of the institute should be dealing with the issue of the fee hike. The institute should understand that charging such hefty fee  from BS students (Physics and Chemistry) is not a good idea when other comparable institutions are charging only a fraction of it. Once the fee hike is implemented, our BS program will no longer remain competitive to the BSc (research) program at IISc Bangalore. IISc is as good a brand as IIT Kanpur and there is no good reason for spending 10 times more money by joining IIT Kanpur when one has the option of studying at IISc. Professor Avinash Singh, ex-HOD of the Physics department says, “The fee disparity has been affecting our PhD intake for two decades, and now looks like this will sadly get extended to the UG  programs in Science as well.” Another professor from the Physics department(requested anonymity) is also of the opinion that the fee increase will have an adverse impact on our BS program in Physics and Chemistry. The professor says that the concern regarding the issue has been raised at the highest level accessible. However, it might not have any immediate result to benefit the in-coming students in 2016 and they might have to pay the increased tuition fee. On a positive note, the professor says, “IISER students often say that there is no comparison between IIT Kanpur and IISERs, when it comes to teaching quality and that their first choice was always IIT Kanpur”. However, the professor is not sure if the better teaching experience of IIT Kanpur faculty will continue to guide the students’ choice, when there is such a severe disparity in fee, and doubts whether the parents will be willing to finance their children’s education for a BS degree in Physics or Chemistry at IIT Kanpur. Professor H. C. Verma, a senior professor in the Department of Physics, expresses a similar view on the issue.  He agrees that we could lose students to other institutions and says that if at all there is a need to  increase the fee, the institute should ensure that all incoming students admitted to the BS programs are provided scholarship.",
      "Currently, students enrolled in BS programs in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics receive KVPY or INSPIRE  fellowships, provided they have a CPI above 6. The first year students receive INSPIRE fellowship if they are in top 10,000 in JEE Advanced. However, these scholarships won’t be enough to meet the educational expenses of incoming students. In such a situation, the institute should request the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, to increase the INSPIRE and the KVPY fellowships from the current amount of Rs 60,000 and 80,000 respectively, to cover the increased tuition fee for the students enrolled in BS programs at IIT Kanpur.",
      "The institute should also look into an innovative model for academic fee suggested by Professor Pankaj Jalote and Professor M Balakrishnan of IIT Delhi in anopinion piecethat they wrote for the Indian Express. In this model, a student joining the institute has the option of deferring the payment of a significant part of his/her academic fee till he/she graduates. Once the student graduates and takes up a career, he/she is required to pay a part of his/her salary (say 15%) as the deferred tuition fee for some years (say 5 years). This helps the student choose a career without worrying about paying the education loan. A student taking up a high paying job pays more and a student taking up a less paying job pays less. What about the students who go for higher education? Well, as far as I understand, the model seems to suggest that those going for higher study should pay very little since they chose a very less “paying career” after graduation. Of course, the details of the model need to be worked out. However, it is a wonderful idea worth considering, since it could solve the problem of over dependence of IITs on government funding without stressing students with a huge debt. It is certainly better than the student loan-driven model of financing one’s higher education, which forces students to go for the job that pays them highest even if it does not suit to their temperament. In fact, this model could help attract more people to pursue PhD. This is important in a situation where higher education is witnessing a huge expansion and a large number of faculty positions are vacant even in IITs.",
      "As a long term measure, IIT Kanpur should also reflect upon the admission process for BS programs in Physics and Chemistry.  After branch change, many seats go vacant in these departments as is evident from the graph below. It is interesting to note that same is not true for the Economics and the Mathematics departments, which tend to overshoot their sanctioned strength.",
      "[infogram id=”64121bc5-3efb-4e69-af8f-4d17a00e3534″ prefix=”pct” format=”interactive” title=””]",
      "The vacancies in Physics and Chemistry departments can be filled by the lateral entry of students from other institutions. This wasproposedrecently in Students’ Senate[16]. The senate modified the proposal,  approved it and forwarded it toSenate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC)[17]. It remains to be seen if the proposal is implemented or not.",
      "Academic flexibility is another important factor which influences the students’ choice of an academic institution. Our academic programs fare better than most other IITs on this parameter and it was also the most important reason for me choosing IIT Kanpur from whatever options I had two years ago. I enjoyed doing Physics then but was not very sure if it was what I wanted to see myself doing in future. IIT Kanpur, with options like double major, minor and a relatively liberal branch change rule, seemed a great option for someone like me, who was still undecided. However, the academic freedom here has its limitations. I painfully realized this fact during my pre-registration for the third semester, when my request for at least five courses got rejected.  Thus, we need to keep moving in right direction, finding ways to make our programs even more flexible. In this context, lowering the CPI criteria to 7 for a double major is a welcome step. Nonetheless, as my and others’ experiences show, there is still a great need for improvement. In particular, we need to have a fresh look on the Core courses. Professors should also be open to welcome students from other departments in their class, which is currently lacking. The possibility of increasing the diversity of the minors offered should also be explored. Interdisciplinary minors could also be offered.  For example, the department of Biological Sciences currently offers a minor in Tissue Engineering. However, additional minors in Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, Biochemistry etc could be offered either independently or with a collaboration from other departments.",
      "Finally, IIT Kanpur should work on improving its outreach to the potential students and their parents. The success of the UG program of IISc can be a lesson for us here. In case of IIT Kanpur, prospective students are hardly aware of the academic flexibility or superior infrastructure that it provides. Then there are several myths associated with it like tougher academics and lack of overall development of students. One of my friends chose IIT Delhi over IIT Kanpur because she thought that IIT Delhi would better contribute to her overall personality development. IIT Kanpur should work on dispelling such popular myths and making prospective students better informed. Prospective students should be aware of the flexible branch change rules, the option of getting a double major and minors and in general the freedom that institute offers in the day to day life. IIT Kanpur needs to connect to its potential students to make them aware of such choices. Currently, students’ choices are heavily influenced by their mentors at the coaching institutes and previous years’ opening-closing ranks. This continues to work against the BS programs particularly, as often programs in Basic Sciences are not thought good enough as compared to those in engineering. One way of helping students make informed choices can be by letting professors of concerned department answer to the queries of potential students during the time of counseling. Lastly,thiswebsite hosted by Professor Dheeraj Sanghi, mentions some initiatives we could take to increase our outreach and to make our UG program in general, more attractive to the potential students. The website suggests that we increase our online presence to improve our perception by communicating to our future students. In particular, we should be able to dispel  myths regarding our academics, placements and campus life, while also communicating the strengths of each of them.",
      "Note 1",
      "The opening rank for the BS Physics program at IIT Kanpur was 26 after the first round of counseling in 2015[18]. It moved to 231 after final round of counseling since the student with AIR 26, who chose IIT Kanpur initially, went to IISc Bangalore. The cutoff rank for admission to BSc (research) program of IISc Bangalore through JEE Advance was 26 in 2015[4].",

      "Are you an undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur? Have you had bad experiences with the UG section of the Academic Affairs Office? Have you ever been told by your batch’s Dealing Assistant, your department’s Convener, DUGC or the Institute’s Chairman, SUGC that you can’t do something (which, to you at least, is) completely reasonable simply because it is against the rules in the UG Manual? If you answered “yes” to these questions, this article is for you!",
      "One of the major drawbacks of being part of an institution as old and big as ours is that there tend to be a lot of rules, and, more often than not, there will always be somebody who wants an exception to the rule. This could be anything, ranging from a student falling one credit short of completing his ESO/SO credits, to a student needing three semester drops on medical grounds (where the UG Manual allows only two). These vary from commonly occurring requests, such as a request to drop a course after the last date specified in the Academic Calendar (something that neither the Chairman, SUGC nor the Chairman, SPGC will ever approve, to prevent setting a dangerous precedent) to very rare requirements, such as the above-mentioned request for three consecutive semester drops. Hence, any self-respecting system like IIT Kanpur’s would have a mechanism to handle these special cases, wouldn’t it? Why yes, yes it would: this mechanism is called the SUGC.",
      "What does this mean? On paper, the SUGC (Senate Undergraduate Committee) is a Standing Committee of the (academic) Senate of the Institute, and advises the Senate on all matters pertaining to its Undergraduate academic programmes. In practice, this includes making policies, as virtually every new academic policy will either have originated from the SUGC itself, or will go through the SUGC before it is even admitted for consideration in the Senate. This also includes routine decisions that have to be taken by the SUGC, as delegated by the Senate either through the Senate Manual or the UG Manual, including, but not limited to, approving semester drops, recommending cases to the Senate or Chairman, Senate for termination on various grounds, recommending branch changes to the Senate, approving the conversion of programmes from BS/BT to Dual Major or Dual Degree (all categories), approving new courses, approving exchange programme requests and so on, all of which are done in formal SUGC meetings and others such as approving course drops and leave applications, which are done outside SUGC meetings by the Chairman, SUGC and the Convener, DUGC.",
      "However, while these are major aspects of the SUGC’s function, a key aspect (whether implicit or explicit, I’m not entirely sure) of its function that faculty members (especially some members who served on the SUGC alongside me) often forget is that of providing a decision-making mechanism for exceptions. If the rules that the Senate had prepared were perfect and complete, there would be no need for an entire committee – for every case that would ever come forward, the DOAA office would simply look up what the relevant rule says and execute it. This, however, is not the case – there is a certain amount of subjectivity to a large number of the rules, empowering the SUGC’s organs (viz. the committee itself, its Chairman, and its individual members as Conveners of their respective DUGCs) to use their discretion in particular scenarios. Thus, I could argue that the SUGCexistsfor special cases – all the other major aspects of its work could easily have been done by either a single individual or by other extant bodies in the Institute such as the Head’s Group, the Institute Advisory Committee or perhaps the Senate itself.",
      "In this aspect, the biggest power vested in the SUGC is the Waiver Clause, thebrahmastraof all clauses in the UG Manual. Clause 16.1 [colloquially known as the Waiver Clause] of thecurrent approved UG Manualstates the following:",
      "“16.1 Waiver",
      "The procedures and requirements set out in this manual, other than those in",
      "Chapters 3, 7.2, 8, and 9, may be relaxed or waived in special circumstances by SUGC. All such exceptions are reported to the Senate.”",
      "The chapters mentioned above are not something a student would ordinarily like to waive anyway, including things such as degree requirements, admission, evaluation, and inadequate academic performance. Thus, with this clause, the SUGC can strike down any rule temporarily for a single student or a group of students, for bona fide reasons. The best part about this clause is the fact that it does not require the approval of the Senate – the SUGC’s approval is all that is required, and while the Senate could, in principle, overturn the SUGC’s decision, this is unlikely and unprecedented for at least the years I’ve been on campus. It cannot be stressed how great a benefit this is – it is a lot easier to convince ~10-15 odd faculty members to make an exception for a special case; it is a lot harder to convince a body which could potentially have all Professors attending its meetings to bypass one of the rules that it itself created.",
      "Well, great, so this clause exists. How does one go about actually using it for their benefit? The first step is knowledge (the more you know, eh?). Once you know that this clause exists, you are empowered – if the Chairman, SUGC tells you something isnot possibleyou can tell him he’s wrong; the waiver clause makes it possible, even if not plausible. However, if you want to go around using this clause to your benefit, I highly recommend not antagonizing the Chairman, SUGC like this – instead, I suggest you either contact the Students’ Senate Nominee to the SUGC of the 4th Year batch (there will always be one due to the structure of the SUGC; at present this is Praveen Honhar) or you contact the Convener, DUGC of your department, depending on what you are comfortable with. In general (though this largely depends on the quality of the Students’ Senate Nominees), I would personally recommend talking to the student member first. While the Waiver Clause can potentially be used for anything, it is constrained by precedent (the ways it has been used in the past, as well as the ways it explicitlyhasn’tbeen used) as well as by the sensibilities of the SUGC at that time. Thus, the student member will have a fair idea of what kind of waiver is likely to get accepted, and can guide you regarding this. Once you’ve crossed the student member, you will have to go and talk to your Convener, DUGC as well as (before or after you meet him/her) have to talk to other faculty in your department to lobby your case in your department. An exceptional request without the departmental faculty’s support behind it is unlikely to get much traction in the SUGC, and conversely, a request which has the unequivocal support of the faculty and/or the Convener, DUGC is unlikelynotto get passed when it comes up in the SUGC. As a final step, it is considered good form to discuss your issue at least once with the Chairman, SUGC as he will be the one finally summarising the decision for your case, and overseeing the implementation of the SUGC’s decision. It is best, thus, to keep all three legs of the SUGC (viz. the student members, the departmental faculty representative, and the Chairman) that a student can contact involved in the case/issue to ensure that the requested waiver passes in the SUGC.",

      "Can achievement or failure be described as ephemeral? I don’t reckon that the i-pod was the last or final product by Apple. Nor do I believe that Thomas Edison locked himself in his room forever because his teacher told him that he was “too stupid to learn anything”. I’ll reiterate what has been said a million times and ignored a billion times, success is a continuous effort where you learn from your failures and get motivated by the rewards you receive on the way.",
      "",
      "The journey in IIT starts as such reward. People around us are full of praises for our efforts. Life looks easy and many of us mistake this start as the destination. At best, it is just a new turn in the journey of life, one that comes with a lot of opportunities to explore. Take this from me – these four years will just fly by, as was the case for many of us. However, in my four years over here, I learned that each second spent in vain was a second not spent at all.",
      "Everyone has different priorities, different ambitions and different skill sets. So the duty of realizing these rests on one’s own shoulders only. Don’t beat your head if you don’t know the answer to the classic question, “what do you want to do 10 years from now?” or what do you want to do in life?”. For many people, the answer to that question might not be clear. But what is absolutely imperative is that one puts in the best efforts to figure these answers out or try to get a sense of what one wants to do in the future. One simple way is to start off by eliminating the things that you don’t want to do. and you might just stumble upon what you want to do in the end. And while doing this,  you would have learnt and experienced hundreds of things on your way. Even if you look at it from a resume/profile building perspective, you are in a win-win situation.",
      "",
      "Let me narrow down a little bit more and converge towards what is required to be done and what we are doing. Let’s start with your daily life. An average day can be spent by sleeping for 8 hours; attending lectures (labs) and/or studying for 7 hours; eating, shower and other daily work for 3 hours and lastly let’s assume 3 hours for any extracurricular activities. This will leave you with 3 hours for yourself. I would consider this a day well spent. But what do most of us really do? I would say 8 hours sleep, 3 hours lectures, 2 hours daily activities and 1 hour extra-curricular. Leaving 10 hours at your discretion which are spent very effectively answering the “Which harry potter character you are?” quiz on Facebook and / or diligently surfing through some practical knowledge bank reliving the days when reproduction chapter was taught in class 10th. Obviously, the timelines or activities can differ to a great extent depending on the person; however, the idea remains essentially same.",
      "This is the time when the clock stops ticking for you but time continues to pass by. Once that phase is gone and we are standing at the edge of the mountain named career, we start thinking to ourselves whether what we have done is enough or not. And mostly the answer is not in our favour. So now this leaves us with only two options, learn from what all others have gone through or go through it all by yourself to draw similar conclusions. For those who wish to choose the former, I would like to give some pointers which might interest some of you.",
      "",
      "Don’t take this as a prescription. One could define his life in terms of different priorities and hence different activities. This extract that I have shared is with a bit of a pragmatic touch. It is in my perception a productive way of spending time. I agree, It is easier said than done but in past many have managed to do just a part of it and achieve great heights.",
      "Before I end I will re-emphasise something for I have seen people go miserably wrong. Your CPI might not be the correct judge for what calibre you hold but it definitely says whether you were able to do the single job that you were entrusted to do in IIT. There have been cases when a person with low CPI (CGPA) has landed in some premium job. Having said that please be very clear that these are exceptions and if everyone could have done the same then there won’t be any exceptions. Genuine and continuous efforts inevitably will translate into a good CPI (CGPA) or higher skill level for which the concerned company will want to have you. Nothing can compensate for your efforts. So please do not while away your time lazing around, it will prove to be very expensive later on.",
      "Work hard,study hard, play hard, it is your time. You can spend it wisely or scatter its ashes in the holy Ganges (ironically the barrage is nearby too). My suggestion: Don’t let the clock stop ticking.",

      "The following is anopinion pieceby a concerned campus resident on the recent proposal to merge Cultural and Films and Media Council. A different take has been presented and the views are entirely of the author.",
      "Recently, the Students’ Senate has called for opinions on the agenda item to merge the Cultural Council and the Films and Media Council.",
      "Link to the document: http://bit.ly/1ZDiWCu",
      "Link to the form: http://bit.ly/1JhgL3j",
      "The proposal has been mailed and opinions have been invited till January 2nd. The proposal will become a Constitutional Amendment on January 4th if it is passed by the Senate in the meeting.",
      "What is the importance of a proposal or a supporting document for crucial policy decisions like merger of councils?Wholesome discussion is a must whenever a human society or institution takes important decisions, having far reaching consequences. We are blessed with an institution, Students’ Senate, where such extensive discussions can take place. Such discussions will become effective and participative only if the General Body Members must have enough information to opine. The proposal or supporting documents in the aforementioned case must make the junta have a 360 degree view of the agenda.Issues like merger of councils are massive and very complex for a common man/woman to have opinion on without the help of experts (which in this case are the respective leaders).",
      "It is very evident that the campus fraternity is slightly naive about massive policy decisions, particularly of the complexity of this nature. The primary aim of the leaders in this case is to make the junta aware about the points on which brainstorming is required. This also involves giving the society sufficient time for popular discussion and opinion formation. We need to be all the more inclusive and persuade students to take stand. The feedback form excellently does this but what good will it do if the people does not know about the issue comprehensively.Clearly, this purpose stands defeated in the recent decision making process regarding the merger of Cult and FMC.The hasty proposal (released 3 hours before the Students’ Senate meeting which happens to be  the last meeting before the presentation of pre conduction report of the upcoming elections) looks incomplete and hazy, so much so that a senior faculty who also happens to be an alumni and the former dean, had the following comments:Let’s have a look at the proposal which has a very large font size, might as well had been written in all caps. Is there a correlation between loudness and clarity in thoughts??The document claims that there will be ‘unique and spectacular’ functioning of the unified Council but fails to list down any other policy rationale apart from collaboration and overlapping roles, which appears to be a myopic worldview. Avoiding substantiation and surface analysis may hamper the 360-degree thinking process of community. Remember, the councils were formed with a certain rationale, should that not be invoked lest we take a step backwards?The problems faced by both the councils at present should be tabulated with citation of examples to which people can relate to. Who knows that someone from the institute comes up with innovative additions to the policy. Remember the role Aaron Swartz played during deliberation against SOPA in USA.The public policy experts, if you have had a discussion with any, emphasize that implementation has to be an inherent in a policy formation and it becomes all the more important considering the close knit structure in place at IITK, between Executives and Legislature. A thought about possible bottlenecks in  1 GS 2 Head combo remains unexplored, not even an iota bit.There are two extremes, one where we usher into a totalitarian society devoid of any popular forums and participation in governance and the other where we find all policy problems getting solved by the population and it is our efforts in present times which will determine where are we heading to.",

      "The following is anopinion pieceby a concerned campus resident on the sudden surge of optimistic posts in the wake of the recent suicides at IIT-M. A different take has been presented and the views are entirely of the author.",
      "Just after this incident in IIT-M, I see a flood of blog posts and articles urging people to realize that they’re not worthless. That situations can improve. That despite your failures you can still succeed.",
      "But, think for a second, will this have ANY effect on someone who is depressed?",
      "To understand how a depressed person feels, imagine going around life wearing blue-tinted glasses; everything you see will be in shades of blue, despite the reality being totally different. Beliefs function as similar mental filters. All incoming information is “colored” with the belief itself. Successes are discounted as “lucky” incidents and failures reflecting your  incompetence. Dear ones only love you “because they’re obligated to do so” and those who reject you reaffirm your undesirability. Your acts of helpfulness are “what anyone else would have done” and your acts of selfishness confirm your immoral nature.",
      "",
      "This is a vicious cycle. As you keep on noticing more information confirming the beliefs and neglecting the information that contradicts them, the beliefs keeps on becoming stronger. Slowly it trickles down in your life. Your thoughts become colored for the worse, and hence your actions too. You stop getting up in the morning and making an effort, because “it won’t make a difference anyway”. You lose interest in activities you liked earlier, thus becoming worse off at them.  You isolate yourself from people; making all but a few of them think of you as a weirdo. Like self-fulfilling prophecies, your beliefs (which started out as false)  have now become true!",
      "Enter Society. Now you also have to face the pain of being labeled as weak or sentimental when you’re already suffering from beliefs of worthlessness. Great. You are told to “keep a stiff upper lip” and “get over it”. Even those who empathize with you will tell you to just  distract yourself and try to make you see the silver linings.",
      "Okay, out of character now. Stop and Think about the times this may have happened to your loved ones and how you reacted to it.",
      "Done? I hope you get my point now.",
      "I agree that seeing the positive side of things and not ruminating over problems are good mental health strategies, just as exercise and a healthy diet are definitely good for your health. But would they cure an illness? Do you really advice someone with cancer to just exercise and eat healthy food? Or just “get over” their fever? NO, right? You take them to a hospital, get them checked and have them take medication and the best possible treatment. A “normal” fever might indicate a simple viral infection or it might be deadly influenza! But you wouldn’t attempt to diagnose that on your own, would you? Similarly, there may be a fine line between depression and plain old blues. But you’re not the one to decide.",
      "Mental illness, then, should be left to the experts. Psychiatrists who have spent their lives scientifically studying mental illnesses and treating them. Although people’s skepticism of psychiatry is somewhat justified – given its controversial history of advocating therapies with little, if any, empirical evidence – modern psychiatry involves the use of effective medication and empirically validated therapies like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. Today, psychiatry can rightfully  claim quick and effective treatment for depression which is based on science.",
      "",
      "We need to get rid of the stigma of going to a psychiatrist and accept a real problem that’s in front of us. If you know someone who’s having serious mental problems or you are going through a difficult phase, get help, consult a psychiatrist. It may turn out to be nothing serious, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.",
      "It’s high time we acknowledge mental illnesses as serious illnesses, which are “out there” and not just “in your head”. To solve a problem, we must accept it first. Ignoring the problem only aggravates it. Trivializing only worsens it. It’s ironic that we insist on modern medicare for all our maladies but rely on traditional wisdom and aphorisms when it comes to the very thing that defines us: Our minds.",

      "Ever wondered on how you could improve your skill sets? Or what you could do in order to get an edge in the competition that we call life?",
      "Be it Science, Engineering, Management or Humanities!",
      "MOOCs are what you are looking for!",
      "What is a MOOC?",
      "MOOC or Massive Online Open Course, are online courses which are accessible to all, with the only prerequisite being the Internet. The term MOOC was first coined by Dave Cormier in the year 2008, during his time at the University of Prince Edward Island. The whole idea behind MOOCs was to provide a learning platform free of cost and ensuring that quality education is accessible to all. Though MOOCs are free to enroll, a verified certificate from the partner Institute can cost you a few bucks.",
      "What is so massive about a MOOC?",
      "A typical class would have anywhere between a hundred to tens of thousands of students. In the recent years, MOOCs have been popular with an estimate of 450+ universities offering a total of about 2500 courses across the world. It is an interesting fact to know that globally there are about 18 million students enrolled in various MOOCs.A majority of those enrolled were found to be high school students who wanted to explore their career options, undergraduates who wished to learn more on an international platform and graduates who wanted to improve their skillset. However, MOOCs are not limited to students, with a fair number of those who are employed actively taking up courses that they found interesting.",
      "What is the difference between a MOOC and an online video lecture series?",
      "A MOOC involves a lot more participation from the instructor as well as the students, it includes multiple assignments, projects, discussions and many such activities in order to give the user a classroom-experience. For example, MIT has partnered up with Edx (MITx) since 2011, offering courses which involve video lectures, regular assignments, access to a discussion forum and on successful completion of the course you could opt for a verified certificate. MIT Opencourseware(OCW) on the other hand is a lecture series started in 2002 covering various topics, while it does include assignments and quizzes, there isn’t any actual verification or certification involved.",
      "Popularity of MOOCs in India",
      "In India the popularity of MOOCs seem to have skyrocketed due to the awareness brought about by various initiatives. Though the term “MOOC” by itself is not very popular NPTEL, Edx, Udacity and Coursera seem to have found their way to our vocabulary. In terms of Indian Institutes, IIM Bangalore(IIMBx) has about 6 courses up on Edx ranging from Statistics for Business to Introduction to Operations Management. IIT Delhi offers a very interesting course onWeb Intelligence and Big Dataon Coursera, which seems to be a hot course with programming enthusiasts. IIT Bombay(IITBombayX) is offering 4 courses on Edx, with Signals and Systems, and Thermodynamics being popular among undergraduates.",
      "NPTEL: The Indian MOOC Provider",
      "The National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning(NPTEL) is the MOOC provider promoted and funded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), with 7 IITs and IISc as its partner institutes. It currently has 25 ongoing courses with about 52 completed courses and a total of only 7267 students certified as of August 2015. Initially NPTEL, started off as an online video lecture series similar to MIT OCW, but later on ventured into a MOOC provider. Also, It is interesting to know that the NPTEL channel has about 149 million views and 400,000 subscribers.",
      "What makes NPTEL unique?",
      "NPTEL in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), conducts proctored exams held in more than 50 cities across India, whereas other MOOC providers conducts online exams without any such supervision. This provides the students a classroom like experience and also greatly reduces any malpractice involved in the certification exam.",
      "MOOCs-A disruptive innovation in the field of education?",
      "A large number of topics can be effectively delivered by means of MOOCs. A course with thousands of active students would result in larger participation, whereby students could discuss and help each other, understand and grasp the concepts a lot better.This would enable students to experience a completely different approach to education.",
      "MOOCs enable certain specific topics targeted at particular groups to be taught efficiently, though this would result in a smaller course strength. An example would be theAgMOOCsor MOOCs for Agriculture run byProf. T. V. Prabhakar, department of Computer Science & Engineering at IIT-Kanpur. The course was primarily targeted for postgraduates, PhDs and working professionals, who otherwise would not be able to do such a course due to lower popularity.",
      "They also serve as an efficient revision process for those who are already familiar with the subject, for example, a large number ofGATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)aspirants referred to NPTEL videos during their preparation and found them quite helpful!",
      "What are the major hurdles faced by MOOCs in India?",
      "The two main hurdles faced by MOOCs are low broadband penetration and loss of interest in the course being taught.",
      "",
      "With the advent of MOOCs in a country like India, colleges across the country would be forced to invest in their broadband infrastructure. This would ensure greater broadband penetration.As of now, many colleges download the lecture videos and students watch it on LAN. This leads to lower participation and is not sustainable on the long run. Also, colleges should realise YouTube as a tool for education and make sure it is accessible rather than ban it.",
      "The completion rates for MOOCs across the world is under 10 percent. It is quite challenging to pitch courses to a large number of participants. For example, the C programming course, conducted byProf. Satyadev Nandakumar, had upwards of 30,000 registrations each time it was run, with about 1500 students taking the final exam. Prof. Nandakumar has been trying to figure out ways to improve the percentage of successful completion, he hopes to accomplish this by reviewing the feedback given, especially from those who had completed more than 20% of the course but dropped it later on.",
      "MOOCs and the Indian market",
      "Given the competitive and education-oriented behaviour of Indians, a course or a certificate offered by an IIT, or any institute of such repute, would always be of great demand among the general population in India. The number of students enrolled for various MOOCs in India is predicted to grow exponentially with the increase in broadband penetration in the coming years. Also, there seems to be a large and untapped market for MOOC providers to venture into delivering MOOCs in regional languages. This provides a huge opportunity for the growth of education based startups.",
      "So now that we have a rough idea on what a MOOC is, I guess it is about time we start MOOCing. With tons of free courses to explore, we should try to make the best of it!",
      "I would like to thankProf. Satyadev Nandakumar,assistantprofessor in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT- Kanpur, who has been instrumental in helping me write this article. He has been an instructor of a C programming course offered by NPTEL last year and is planning on teaching the same course withProf. Amey Karkarethe coming year.",

Posters, black bands and candles in hand, under the able and headstrong leadership of Samarth Bansal along with the enthusiastic participation of the charismatic students, the three kilometer long march began, in deafening silence. The posters and the discipline made many people join in en route. However none of this would have been possible without the admirable efficiency of the SIS guards on campus, who were there at every step of the way, organizing the walk, controlling the traffic and ensuring that the entire march was smoothly conducted.",
      "Upon culmination, the students placed their candles on the road and met media personnel near the gate to express their views on the event. The students reiterated their demands for justice and expressed hope that an impartial investigation into the events of the 28th of August would take place. Let us hope the march for justice does indeed make justice see the light of the day.",

      "A peaceful gathering of people not older than you or I. Singing, dancing, standing up for a cause. The exuberance of unabashed youth twinkling in their eyes. And suddenly, in a matter of a few hours their world had turned completely turtle. Lathis flew, friends were injured and lives were threatened. And through all this, the student community of Jadavpur University has come out in unison, with courage and strength.",
      "Hok Kolorobisn’t just another phrase from a Bengali textbook. Roughly translated, it means “let voices rise”. And that is exactly what the Jadavpur agitation is all about. To raise one’s voice against what is wrong even in the face of the gravest oppression and staunch opposition. Given the coverage and support this agitation has received from all parts of the country, people already must have a fair idea about the issue. But still, for the sake of relevance, a brief overview of the events is given below.",
      "These events are quoted from two of our friends present in the JU campus who prefer to remain anonymous.",
      "Now, as an individual sitting in the campus of IIT Kanpur, 1200 kilometres up the Ganga, far from where this agitation is on in full swing one may wonder about the relevance of the movement. Although one  cannot comment on whether it was correct on the part of the students to use the method they did to bring justice to the accused for this shameful crime. But it a completely valid and legal path. But as a student and more so as a human being, one simply cannot justify the use of violence on a group of peaceful protestors.",
      "This article however is not about the lathi-charge, it is not a character sketch of the Vice Chancellor or a personal rant of the authors against either of the two parties involved. No, instead this article is about the validity of such a step, of its repercussions, of the need for people to be aware of what is turning out to be a matter of national importance as well as to make sure the original issue does not get overshadowed.",
      "So, firstly, why should one unleash the police force on a group of unarmed students? Could the Vice Chancellor not have been rescued without resorting to such measures? As a nation proud of her democratic identity which also upholds the right to peaceful protest, this was completely uncalled for. September 17, 2014 will perhaps be registered as a black day in the history of Indian Education.",
      "Following the issue, however, presumably neither the police nor the concerned authorities would have anticipated what this would snowball into. From being an isolated event in Kolkata, it transformed almost overnight into a nation-wide movement making #hokkolorob the most trending topic over social media. Students from distant parts of the country have extended their solidarity. From protest marches being undertaken in multiple campuses, to petitions being raised against this blatant use of power, support and solidarity has arrived from the most unlikely sources. A mega protest march on Saturday, 20th September, saw over a lakh students and common citizens of Kolkata converge to march towards Raj Bhavan and lodge a complaint to the Governor of West Bengal, who also happened to be the Chancellor of Jadavpur University.",
      "So, why should the event bother us?",
      "Bengal, especially Kolkata, is notorious over the nation for the influence of politics on education – there is an understandable repulsion for student politics which usually transcends being truly representative of the student voice are often fabricated over greater political gain. This incident though is different. These are our colleagues, our friends, who are protesting, without any tinge of political colour. From a personal view, these are people whom the authors have known and grown up with. And to see them hurt and physically assaulted, without any fault on their part, while standing up for justice –  is something any rational mind cannot fathom.",
      "This event also serves as an eerie reminder of the attack by goons allegedly owing allegiance to a local politician at GSVM College, Kanpur, in March 2014. The campus of IIT Kanpur had not been affected directly, but the audacity of people in power came as a rude shock to many and made us raise our voice. We know now that howsoever isolated such incidents may seem or how far-off and detached one might be, there is no guarantee that this might never happen to you. Sitting far-off in the comforts of one’s home with the escapist view of being glad to be away from all the hullabaloo while wanting the nation to change at the same time is a fool’s utopia. Discussing how wrong such matters are over coffee and yet not doing anything about it, or worse, shrugging them off as something of little concern, is downright dangerous. A nation’s strength lies not in its numbers but in the ideals it is beset in. And the idea of justice has been dealt a blow by this incident. It is precisely this reason that students all over the nation need to (and are) show their solidarity.",
      "A word of caution. The use of oppressive force on unarmed students has somehow taken the limelight away from the root cause of it all. The molestation charges levelled by the girl and justice to be meted out to the ones responsible for such a heinous crime. We would like to emphasize that it is of prime importance this issue is not forgotten. And of course, not allowing any untoward incident to take place that would invalidate the non-violent nature of the protest is also vital. The attitude of the people of Kolkata regarding this has been admirable. There has been no violence or vandalism and we hope that it remains this way.",
      "Finally to conclude, the authors of this article meant it to inspire people to rise up in support of our fellow mates waging their battle miles away. We hope and pray that good sense finally prevails and justice is served. And if such an event happens in the future, the students of the nation, the back-bone of the society, do not need to take to the streets to protest.",
      "It has often been said that there are only two ways to live: “You either let things be or take up the mantle to change what is wrong”. In the end, it is a choice we all have to make.",
      "As an epilogue, a candle march is going to be organized at IIT Kanpur to show solidarity and we encourage the campusjuntato support the cause.",

      "This article raises question on the selection of Rohan Bansal as the Chief Election Officer, Student’s Gymkhana 2014-15. This is an anonymous opinion voiced by a concerned student. Comments of President Students’ Gymkhana and Chairperson, Students’ Senate follow up the opinion piece.",
      "The involvement of students in campus administration is a distinctive feature of our campus. Hence its functioning is endowed with both- the priceless life experience of our faculty members in administering it as well as the vigor and new ideas brought in by young students. Students’ involvement is enacted by an apt division of power between the faculty members and the student body of the campus. Students exercise this power through their representatives. Hence its not only important for the student representatives to be approachable to their electorate, but each student must be given an equal chance to get elected as one of the representatives. This points to the importance of fair and free elections in the campus. If the election procedure is not glitch-free, it will not only harm the foundation of all constitutional provisions, but it will also engender the feeling of distrust among the students in the functioning of Students’ Gymkhana. The responsibility of conducting elections democratically is on the shoulders of Election Council, Students’ Gymkhana.",
      "One of the agenda items for the second meeting of Students’ Senate was the ratification of the selected candidate, Rohan Bansal, for the post of Chief Election Officer(CEO hereafter) for Students’ Gymkhana 2014-15. The candidate to be ratified for the post was the same person whose nomination for UG Y11 Senator, 2014 was canceled by the Election Council last year. His nomination wasn’t canceled because he tried to find out loopholes into the system and tried to deceive the governing body. But, he was one of those few (perhaps the only one), who showed an exceptional confidence in himself that in spite of not abiding by the rules and regulations of the Election Council, EC would not be able to do any harm to his nomination. Contrary to his belief, Election Council rejected his nomination. He came up with a manifesto which was a word to word match to one of the other candidate’s (currently a senator, Y11) manifesto. When the code of conduct is in effect, constitution clearly describes that no two candidates can work in collaboration. To hold the position of responsibility of a senator, he was not only too lethargic to think of the ways in which he wanted to transform the campus for the betterment of the students, but he did not even take a second to interchange the position of words in someone else’s manifesto.",
      "Objection was raised in the Students’ Senate by a few senators on his selection as CEO. There were two primary reasons in favor of Rohan. Firstly, his application was the best among all the candidates who applied for the post according to the selection committee, comprising of the Chairperson, Students’ Senate and the President, Students’ Gymkhana. Secondly, few senators were of the view that humans do commit mistakes, and everyone does deserves a second chance.",
      "And as a consequence, his name was ratified by full consensus. And so here is the situation – An election defaulter is now leading the Election Commission, to ensure free and fair elections.",
      "The situation engendered a need for challenging the selection and the ratification decision by the Students’ Gymkhana. A few students took the job. Some students went to DOSA under the impression that Constitution has vested in him such powers to overrule the decision. Unfortunately, they found out that DOSA was unwilling to interfere and wanted the students to handle the issue themselves.",
      "I have no personal grudges against the concerned person. But I write this article to apprise you that we all are watchdogs this year. Each and every one of you who wants their true representatives to be elected for next year’s Gymkhana should keep an eye on the activities of EC and must report any malpractice. This will maintain pressure on EC to function appropriately according to the constitution. Moving forward, I think that the defaulters should be prohibited from holding any position of responsibility in the next year. In fact, even some faculty members support this. In absence of any such provision till date, this year we have to rely completely on scrutiny of EC’s functioning by the whole electorate. Also to avoid situations like this in future, such suggestions should be taken into consideration by Students’ Senate and constitution must be amended to include such provisions. This whole episode points to the need of an independent judicial body in the campus so that even the decisions of Students’ Senate can be challenged. Current DOSA feels that even if he sees some discrepancies in the working of Gymkhana, the students see his intervention as using a ‘whip’ over the body and a disturbance in the distribution of power granted by the constitution. Hence installation of such a body will reduce workload of DOSA office, grant him redemption from such blames and at the same time, will ensure democratic and transparent functioning of the Gymkhana.",
      "To get the perspective of selection panel, Vox spoke to Abhimanyu Arora (President, Students’ Gymkhana) and Anurag Sahay (Chairperson, Students’ Senate).",
      "Abhimanyu says that in his opinion, the “offense” of Rohan in the past election was minor, and the EC was harsh by cancelling his nomination. “Rohan’s record as the President of HEC, Hall-2 is commendable, and I have no doubts in his leadership abilities. His candidature was way better than any other candidate.”, says Abhimanyu. He also conveyed that CEO doesn’t have dictatorial powers. EC team members are there to keep a check on CEO and making sure he is not misusing the vested powers.",
      "Anurag, in contrast with the President, does not believe that copying an election manifesto is a minor offense. Quoting Anurag, “The first time we called for nominations and conducted interviews, we could not find an apt-candidate. Hence, re-nominations were called, and among the applicants, Rohan was the best candidate. Given his past record, we could have considered calling for renomination for the second time. But that would have resulted in delay in conduction of upcoming DUGC/DPGC and Senate by-elections, to be held in first week of September.”",
      "Adding to that, the Chairperson says, “Any student (not just senators) has the right to come to a Senate meeting and object at any time – all of the students who went to the DOSA knew that the Senate meeting was happening and that the agenda including this ratification. If they truly believe the situation required interference, they should have come and aired their opinions in the Senate instead of approaching the Dean directly and compromising the integrity of the ratification process. Students’ Senate is the judicial body, and even now, if a student strongly feels that something wrong has taken place, all he/she need do is convince a Senator to file an agenda in the next Senate meeting to discuss this decision again, and the matter will be discussed again, despite their tardiness in objecting.”.",

      "With already so much having been commented upon the maiden speech of ‘not-an-accidental’ PM by nearly all prominent journalists and columnists of varied viewpoints and contrasting ideologies there is only little scope left for further review of the confident articulation which many have already classified as historical. So why this article? Actually, we are ‘Pakke Bhartiya’ who never feel contended by any speech made -howsoever great it may sound- as we find something in it to dissent from. Here we didn’t find much to dissent from so we were compelled to explore what more points could be raised in such a special and path-breaking speech. And we came across the issues which were of significance but failed to find space in the archival extempore of our dear Prime Minister. Let’s take them one by one-",
      "That corruption is nowhere in the real agenda of the present governmentis apparent by the PM’s speech where we didn’t hear the word ‘भ्रष्टाचार’for once.",
      "Corruption is certainly one of the most clichéd terms in India’s context and who can be held responsible for this? Surely the politicians who have always deceived the people with their speeches in the doublespeak and with their multiple standards on the various issues. So is it not the responsibility of the most powerful politician of the country to make it clear what his intention and plan of approach is. That  corruption is nowhere in the real agenda of the present governmentis apparent by the Prime Minister’s speech where we didn’t hear the word ‘भ्रष्टाचार’ even for once.And this is disappointing especially when he and his government are already breaking free of the prevailing stereotypes. He talked of reforms at the micro level e.g. moral and human values, platitudes like service-not-job, and the teachings from the scriptures like individual vigilance (जाग्रयाम् वयम्). An appeal for keeping away from corrupt activities could signal at least a positive sign, if not change the behavior of the people overnight.",
      "This is a fact that he has talked so much about the sanitation issue in the pre-election as well as post-election speeches and also that the Ganga Clean Mission has been given very high priority with local people also being involved in this. Then what’s the problem? Perhaps Mr. PM is not directly responsible for this thing but the long tradition of falsehood and betrayals by the bunch of crook politicians has forced the people not to believe in promises and appeals. And the most suitable evidence is the following picture of post-I Day celebrations. PM talked so much of sanitation and what happened just after he finished? Wish he could anticipate it!",
      "Also very important is manual scavenging issue as Jairam Ramesh has reviewed the speech on the sanitation front and has written that ‘given the time he devoted to sanitation in his speech, it would have only been appropriate that the Prime Minister spoke feelingly about the persistent prevalence of manual scavenging across the country’.",
      "",
      "Very closely associated with sanitation is health which- unlike sanitation- couldn’t find the words of PM. He talked about universal access to health infrastructure using broadband but that too in the context of Digital India. Also for a just healthcare system universal access is necessary but certainly not sufficient. The equitable distribution of medicines, the medicine patent issue and improvement in the services of government hospitals are important too. He could talk about IMR and child mortality being 2.5 times higher in rural areas than their urban counterparts. He could have pointed out at the major issue of malnutrition in our children with the fact that 40% of them receive less food than they should.He could have made people aware about the alarming jeopardy of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes etc. especially in North India. He could have drawn attention of his MPs- as part of the village adoption scheme- and other citizen about the miser availability of drinking water at large number of places even today. He could have borrowed the idea of sound health of all citizens from Swami Vivekananda who- as he said- “could never speak a false word”. But he missed it completely!",
      "Everyone knows about the demographic dividend India is likely to enjoy in near future and also about the ambitious plans of PM who emphasized on his slogan of Yuva Shakti and who is prepared to trap this Shakti by introducing new Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. So far, so good.But who would disagree that the youngsters will be only building upon the contributions of the remaining not-so-young population.They should not be treated as if they are like burden on us. PM missed the opportunity to make young India realize this.",
      "Whether it is his dislike for alleged ‘Muslim appeasement’ of Nehru and that of Congress or the start of a new era in Indian politics when politicians will talk less and less in terms of religious disparity- we don’t know and hence wouldn’t comment upon. But just by looking at the various observations and recommendations in report submitted by Sacchar Committee on status and welfare of Muslims in India one can feel the pressing need to take serious steps. The committee had said that Muslims have very less percentage of employed population, even lesser than the SCs/STs.",
      "Also few positive words- but not just of formality- could help the administration a lot in bringing the series of communal violence to an end which have been happening repeatedly in many parts of country, especially in Western UP. He could have been more direct in asking India to celebrate its diversity. His words like‘ye desh sirf kisi ek dharm ya samudaay ka nahin hai’ might have passed important message to religious fanatics. It could also have widened his acceptance among all communities.",
      "While this ad of KBC was being aired on the National TV for the first time I realized that the intensity of the problem was so high and so beautifully presented that even Mr. Bacchan was reduced to a secondary element. Unfortunately PM didn’t see this ad. Hence he could not utilize the opportunity to bring the contribution of North-East in nation building before the whole nation. While mentioning CWG medals he could have recognized the athletes from NE. Also it was convincingly important to add some P.S. to the National Anthem considering the fact that the great poet Tagore couldn’t fit this territory into the rhythm of the song.",
      "He talked about sanitation but made no mention of efforts needed to preserve our environmental resources. Perhaps this was- and is- not a matter of concern for someone coming from poor background. Don’t you remember this is how he came to sanitation point that he has seen what sanitation means for the poor? Anyway he could have endorsed the idea of going green at macro as well as micro level. And as the title goes he had the best opportunity in hand to redefine the third color of Tiranga. Missed the golden opportunity to break another stereotype!",
      "This is the first shloka of the first chapter of Chāndogyopaniṣad which translates loosely as ‘the essence of all beings is the earth, the essence of the earth is water’. This could be used- the same way he used two other shloka- to link the significance of water resource with our cultural values. He should have brought it to notice of nation- specially addressing the rural population- how important it is to redeem our lost and encroached water resources and at the same time to preserve the available ones for future generations.",
      "These are attitudinal changes which percolate from top to bottom in a society. He could have appealed to parents for giving their wards freedom of choice among available options. He could have asked teachers- particularly ones teaching in government-run schools- to understand the great responsibility of nation building they have been vested with. At the same time students could have been encouraged to make constructive inroads in cutting edge technologies.",
      "P.S: Our intention behind writing this long article has not been to show our deliberate skepticism towards the words of PM or the Government but it is only that we wanted to make note of what could be added more. It was important because he should not forget them at Lal Quila next year.",

      "For most, returning back home to India after a summer under a foreign sky is a joyous occasion to look forward to. However, there is one common observation in all the narratives – the overt difference one definitely senses as soon as one touches down in India. The roads, the people, the maintenance, everything is different to the worse. The only joy is getting back home, getting back to college, getting back to friends! However, after having spent a splendid summers at The University of Calgary, Canada under a 3-month internship period, I had to face a harsh reality; sometimes other things also take a turn for the worse!",
      "Registering for a new academic semester at IITK requires a student to be physically present in the campus at the stipulated date. Since the organization has to deal with a rich diversity of students from different backgrounds, students are provided with a flexibility in the form of a ‘late registration’ provision – in case a student is not able to register on the stipulated date due to reasons beyond the individual’s control (medical reasons, unavailability of train tickets, etc.), he/she can get registered a week later by paying a fine of INR 1000. For the semesters I have been in campus, the fine was waived off for the students submitting veritable proof of exigencies (medical prescriptions, train tickets). Those unable to provide such proof,get registered along with the fine. If this has been the protocol, there was certain breach of it this time!",
      "As it turns out, every semester roughly 10 per cent of the students opt for late registration, which is a huge number of exigencies for one single week. Another careful glance at the statistics and it is easy to see that there is some truth in the claim by the administration that the students are taking the provision leniently. As an economist, a valid argument could be that the marginal utility to a student of being at the place of his/her choice for another week, thereby extending the summer vacation or completing a summer intern, is more to the student than the cost of late registration. The demand for late registration is, thus apparently, quite high. Hence, in order to check the existing student behavior, the procedure for late registration now was lengthened and spiced up with reprimand directed towards the students at various outlets of the process of getting registered legitimately.",
      "A late registration procedure requires approval of the application by Chairman, SUGC.  In case the student is not a typical defaulter, there was no fuss made of the procedure and it used to be considerably, glitch-free. The present Chair in the authority had to however, be the strict disciplinarian and he would go by the rules, which are probably his own – he decided to base the case of each application on the merit of it (a good thing when you have the tenacity and patience to do it). It meant that the Chairman had to review applications equivalent to around 10 per cent of the student body, i.e. 600, in a span of a few hours. It also meant that the academic (DOAA) office would be flooded by students wishing to get registered.",
      "Apparently all was fine till lunch, when finally dawned the realization that going through 600 applications in a few hours was impossible and punitively forcing 600 students to drop the semester was also not a feasible option, all the students were allowed to register after signing an ‘undertaking’ –",
      "“The reasons stated by me for late registration are not compelling enough and such behavior, I shall not repeat in future.”",
      "Sorry Sir, where are we? In an institute of national importance or in the kindergarten? He may as well have asked us to write “Sorry, I would not trouble you’’, a hundred times.",
      "There are some flaws visible to me in following the above stated procedure. Firstly, the applications were not scrutinized before getting the ‘undertaking’ signed. Secondly, the students were figuratively made to sign this ex-officio document at gun point – told to sign it if they wished to get registered. So, there is a strong chance no one feels what they have written. Thirdly, for many students who had to reach campus after a hectic and tiring journey (like 48 hours non-stop for me with the jet lag), it seemed neither humanitarian nor ethical to ask them to go through this sadistic cameo!",
      "The focus of this article is now to contrast the recent positive changes in the administration of the country and that of IITK. One of the first issues that took center stage after formation of the new government was speeding up the administrative procedures by eliminating unnecessary paper work and wishing to do away with the red-tapistbabu behaviorby using technology. This policy does not hold true in our country alone, but countries like UK and Australia have also set up separate governmental organizations to speed up the functioning of the government.",
      "Institutions like IITs serve the students from different parts of the country. In such a scenario, the e-registration portal should be developed to facilitate students to get registered by the stipulated date without consumption of any time.It is true that introduction of e-registration at IITK might take some time but it does not make sense to move towards rigidity in a step function till constructive elaborate reforms. Also, following a procedure which is impossible to be completed in the available time is also no solution to check students’ undesirable behavior.",
      "Throughout three years of my stay on campus, I have observed administrative procedures becoming more cumbersome and rigid with time. There have been days during my stay on campus when I wanted to nail a hook on my wall but after going through a chain of authorities to get the permission for the same, my request was rejected!  And few say, IITK offers you the most liberal environment. Maybe we need to do a little more here.",
      "The infamous late registration day was just another instance. On enquiring the reason for the same from the Dean of Students’ Affairs (DOSA), I found out that such rebuttals from the administration were to be interpreted as repercussions of the indiscipline engendering in the student body. I sincerely appreciate the concerns of the administration to bring discipline to campus life but some people probably need to understand Mahatma Gandhi when he said that the future does not only depend upon the goal you choose but also upon the path chosen. The strictness and rigidity might lead us to a disciplined campus like the authorities desire but is this approach progressive or regressive?",
      "Update: In the 2014-15/3rd Meeting of the Senate held on 28th November, 2014, the Senate decided to allow all students to register late for any reason (subject to payment of the fine for late registration). Only in the case that a student wishes a waiver on the late registration fine will he/she have to request the Chairman, SUGC (for UG students) or DOAA (for PG students) to allow him/her to register with no late fee if he/she has a valid reason.",

      "अहम् भोकालम् , Superheroes, Medieval Fantasy, The Mafia – Antaragni has ceaselessly captured my imagination year after year. But despite the fact that I swooned over these themes, I would be fibbing if I claimed that any of themes resonated with what Antaragni could be and what I wanted Antaragni to be. The only theme that could descry what I’m talking about is Antaragni ’09’s theme – ‘I am the change’. After reaching a certain point, an organization of the likes of Antaragni stops being just another student-run festival and becomes a vehicle of change. Legends like Vishal Dadlani, Raghu Dixit, Rahul Ram bear testimony to Antaragni’s legacy and it’s ability to infuse change.",
      "Antaragni stands today for the aspirations of thousands of students who after months of practice compete against the best in the country.Our vision for the festival was very clear, we wanted a theme that the students could identify with, a theme which was steeped in our rich culture and could portray the ambitions of the students who compete here. Choosing a theme which could be a mouthpiece of this sentiment was an uphill task. And after what seemed like an eternity, we came across this gem of a theme which we rejected out of hand. To be frank, it seems absurd in the beginning, but it  grew on all of us. ‘Aham Bhokalam’. You have to marvel the simplicity of the theme, it’s ability to mean different things to different people, its enigma and its closeness to our culture.",
      "Yes, the theme has caused its fair share of cause celebre. I for one believe, that the only way to appreciate it would be to let go of the negative connotations we have associated with the word ‘Bhokal’. ‘Aham Bhokalam’ perfectly portrays the spirit of Antaragni – the unfathomable power of the human will – of unleashing the power within. ‘Aham Bhokalam’ for us is a celebration of our indomitable spirit, of finding new meaning in conventional wisdoms, of creating our own paths, of exploring territories where no woman(or man) has ever gone before, to use that line, of being open to the different choices that people make.",
      "The crux of the theme I shall say, is that we can be what we want to be, with of course a zing of our homeland – Kanpur.",

      "An inter block hall tournament’s final was being played. It was a tense stage. As the scorer gave the scores – “twelve -fourteen”, a section of the audience shouted “Hindi mein bol”. Other parts of the audience whistled appreciatively. Later, as a person from the south was serving, another section of the audience started shouting “ille! pille!” (their conception of all South Indian languages) again to raucous cheers. People say these are comments made in the heat of battle, and should be given no significance. But these are no innocent statements, they are more like Freudian slips. They reveal a deep seated tendency which is current in the majority of IITK students. This article deals with the manifestation of this tendency in the apparent lack of “polish” in IITK graduates. The average IIT Kanpur student develops a certain skill set during his stay in the institute. Yes, every IIT graduate is an expert in writing exams and finishing assignments, but whither the “soft” skills which make the difference in a photo finish in a job interview? What does an interview board do with applicants who cannot interact with unfamiliar people, with superiors and inferiors? What use does it have for people who cannot tolerate differences in opinion and adapt to new conditions? It jettisons them. What can be the causes of this pressing problem? When we contacted Prof Manoj Harbola for his views on the subject, he said that composition of student population in the campus plays a major role. With a huge chunk of the students coming from places nearby, this place now lacks a cosmopolitan culture. The prevalence of the local UP culture has isolated other “minorities”. People with the same traditions and views tend to move around together. This cultural isolation makes it difficult for students to get to know other ways of life and learn how to co-exist. A classic demonstration of the hackneyed adage “Birds of a feather flock together.” Another instantiation of this phenomenon is the lack of communication with students from outside IIT Kanpur. Antaragni, and, to an extent, Udghosh and Techkriti now represent the sum and substance of our “efforts” to meet students of other colleges. Festivals and isolated events are but stepping stones to wider cohesion among students. The isolated location of the campus and the relative paucity of other local colleges are other possible contributors to this malaise. As put by Prof Harbola, an IITK student, over time, develops the attitude that he cannot learn anything from people from supposedly “inferior” colleges. Being in the intellectual bourgeoisie, why do we need to listen to the lesser ones? Alas! The tradition of lone wolves has passed on. The era of teamwork has dawned. Perceptions of the elite and the non-elite no longer hold in an intellectual democracy. In stark contrast, students in other IITs in metropolitan cities have healthy competition from of a lot of other local colleges. Students from different parts of the country intermingle in a veritable melting pot of cultures. Due to this, their students enjoy a campus life throbbing with vitality. Are these problems going to die out by themselves? Sadly, they aren’t. Take the skewed distribution of the students in the incoming batch. It is deteriorating with time. As it becomes narrower, the pressure of the old figures will bear down on new batches. This trend isn’t going to reverse itself. Take the location of the institute. It is a noble thought that this IIT will develop the surrounding areas. But isn’t the interaction two way? The environment of the institute also molds its students and its output. Till the chimera of development is actually achieved, the negative feedback will continue. To change this situation, the students must gear up to broaden their horizons. The reading rooms in the halls subscribe to magazines from different parts of the world. Some of the reading rooms are languishing due to lack of patrons. Similarly, news channels and the internet can help the students keep in touch with happenings in different parts of the world. The much treasured “bulla” sessions (the informal chat sessions which are rife in hostels) can be used like group discussions, to help develop informed opinions on important issues. Most students here do not have the habit of reading, for how can it be useful? These steps do not pay dividends in the narrow sense which most of the supposed “cream” of the country studying here perceive life, based on their limited experience. All these steps require a personal initiative and sincerity of attitude which is sorely missing in IITK students now. As the cliché goes – “true change can come only from within”.",

      "So one more year of disappointment. Out of top 100 JEE rankers, only two have joined IIT Kanpur. For someone belonging to the era where more than 50 joined IIT Kanpur, this is shocking, but it has been this way for a few years. And last year it was actually zero out of 100.Every year, after the JEE statistics are known, we have a discussion on the faculty mailing list. Some people will express shock while a majority would consider this insignificant.Some would say that it is more important to attract good PG students than to attract good UG students. Alright, but are we attracting good PG students compared to those IITs who are attracting higher JEE rankers. I think there is a correlation between the two, since attracting students is a function of our perception in the marketplace. If students perceive us as good they will come, otherwise not. And hence it is necessary to worry why this negative perception about IITK. Also, do we have to attract either good PG students or good UG students. Can’t we attract both. Shouldn’t we attract both.Then some fatalists would say that we can’t compete with metro IITs. Students today are looking for something that only metro cities can provide. What is it that these students are looking for. It seems that when students graduate from here, most of them are pretty happy with their stay here and seem to genuinely believe that they got everything that their friends in metro IITs got and then some more. Can we not leverage this good feelings to attract top rankers in both JEE and GATE.Some will argue that we can’t compete with metro IITs in placement and that is all that students look for at admission time. Unfortunately, these faculty members do not even know our own strengths, and are giving up too soon. Our placements are actually comparable to other IITs, and in certain perspectives, even better.Some would argue that there isn’t much difference between top 100 and the next 100. Lets accept that, but then are we attracting the next 100. Are they coming to IITK because they found something great about IITK. Or did they come to IITK because they couldn’t get into other IITs. Shouldn’t IITK be bothered if in each of its program/discipline, students prefer 2 or 3 other IITs before IITK.Some would argue that we should just do our job well, and not worry about perceptions. Good argument that. It is, of course, yet another debate on whether we are doing our job well. Whether the flexibility that our UG programs has on paper is for real. What percentage of our students are able to complete even minors, not to talk about second major, just to give one example. How many faculty members agree to let students from all departments to register in their courses. The add/drop period is on right now, and the number of queries I get from students asking me how to get any course in the Open Elective slot is not a small number. Of course, these are problems across the IIT system, and not specific to IIT Kanpur, as I found out recently in my meeting with Deans of other IITs.And hence we have an opportunity. If we can somehow create a culture where most faculty members permit students from outside the department to register for their courses, resulting in more number of minors, a greater number of graduates with wider horizons, a more positive student experience overall, I am sure we won’t have to do much more. So, yes, just doing our job well will attract more students.Of course, this will not be the end of the argument. Since as soon as you talk about doing more as a teacher, a new debate on teaching versus research will get started. It will be forgotten that I am really not talking about a higher teaching load, but just a more diversified load. So, the issue is really not of teaching versus research, but just a better student experience. I am sure an improved experience will make all these students to attract next year’s students and so on.We could also take up the task of communicating our huge strengths to our potential students and their parents.Our internal stake holders too need to be aware of those communications.",

      "We had our convocation on 18th June, 2014. This time we tried a new format. For the last few years, we had one main function where there will be speeches, a few awards, in some years, PhD degrees were awarded, and then we had two more ceremonies later, one for just giving away PG degrees and the other for just giving away UG degrees. These degree giving ceremonies neither looked like a formal occasion nor a celebratory one. They did not have academic procession, or any invocation, no speeches, or even the National anthem. It was just a photo opportunity for the students and nothing else. In fact, the students were keen to slip out of the auditorium just after they received their degrees and they had to be stopped by closing the doors or having security volunteers at those doors.",
      "This time we changed to two full-fledged convocations, a morning one and an evening one. Both had a procession, both had their respective Chief guests, all the speeches, invocation, national anthem, etc. In one function, all the PG degrees and awards were given, and in the other all UG degrees and awards.",
      "It was extremely well received, but for one problem. The previous format discouraged students and parents, while the new format was attractive to them. Also, the number of graduates was higher this time compared to previous years. Both these things combined, the number of students who came to receive their degrees in person increased substantially, and we could not accommodate some of the parents in the auditorium, leading to some heartburn.",
      "What is the way forward. In the informal discussions with graduating batch, two points come out very clearly. One, they would like the convocation to be held as soon as possible after their completing the requirements. Two, their parents and possibly other family members be able to watch them receive degrees. Also, students did not like being given degrees without any ceremony. One also has to note that the number of graduates will increase further next year.",
      "The options are as follows (at least those I could think of, I am sure there can be more):",
      "1. Keep two ceremonies on the same day, like this year, and inform students in advance that parents will not be allowed, or at most one parent will be allowed.",
      "2. Keep two ceremonies on the same day, but shift the convocation to a later date, say in October, which would be inconvenient for many graduates, attendance will reduce, and we will manage to permit both parents of all graduates.",
      "3. Have three functions serially on the same day. Of course, we can not have three full-fledged convocations on the same day. So it will have to be the earlier model of one main function and then just the degree distribution functions for providing photo opportunity. But it is not clear if this will really allow both parents of all students to be present in the degree distribution ceremonies. It will be touch and go and may cause heartburns if more students attend.",
      "4. Have three (or more) functions on the same day, but allow parallelism. More on this later in the blog.",
      "5. Have three (or more) functions on different days. Again, more on this below.",
      "It is obvious that with the increasing numbers, we will have to have three (or more) functions to accommodate all graduating students and their parents in the convocation. The issue is whether everyone gets degrees on the same day, or is it ok to give degrees on different days. So, options 4 and 5 are really what we need to focus on.",
      "Option 4 can be implemented by having one function in the morning, and having two (or more) functions in the afternoon. For example, we could have PhD and Master’s degrees granted in the morning session, and in the afternoon, have one session for engineering departments, and another for non-engineering departments. This model is extensible to even larger numbers, since we could introduce more and more parallel sessions as the number of graduates increase. Thankfully, we will soon have another lecture hall with a capacity of 600 which could be used for this purpose. The hall will be available in time for the 2015 convocation.",
      "Option 5 can be implemented by either having the multiple sessions on two consecutive days, or having one or two sessions in summer and having another one or two sessions in the winter. For example, we could continue with the two functions in summer as we did this year, and have one function in winter where all those who graduate in July and December can be given their degrees.",
      "While it will be possible to have two parallel functions in the afternoon, there will be issues. First, one function will be larger (in auditorium with 1200 capacity) and the other will be smaller (in L-20, with 600 capacity). So their relative importance would not be equal in everyone’s mind. Further, we have a very strong notion of batch in the student body. To split the graduating batch into two may not be appreciated by students, since they also want to receive their degrees and specially awards in fron of all their batchmates. Also, in our system, Chairman, Senate gives all the degrees, and he cannot be present in two places at the same time. Also, in our system, DOAA office manages the convocation, and managing two convocations in parallel would be a challenge for the staff. But, these are minor issues. (For example, the functions in the afternoon can be split based on year of joining.)",
      "The other possibility of having convocations in winter and summer does not have above-mentioned issues, and it really helps those who are graduating in July and December. They don’t have to wait for the next summer to receive their degrees. So it is a very attractive option, but it comes with a cost. The convocation organization requires a lot of preparation and substantial funds. Doing it twice in a year would increase the costs both in terms of human resources as well as monetary costs.",
      "Sooner or later, Senate will have to take a call on this. But as of now, there is no consensus, and unless a quick decision is taken between option 4 and option 5, a lack of decision will eventually result in choosing option 1 by default, and a lot more heartburn amongst our graduating students and their parents.",

      "Recently, the Senate approved the branch changes for the 2013 batch students. In a batch of 820, the number of students who have received a branch change after the first year is 54 this year, a significantly higher number compared to recent years since we liberalized our branch change rules last year. Given that we also allow more branch changes after the 3rd and 4th semester, one would estimate that after those two semesters, about 8 percent of the batch would have got a branch change. I believe that this would be amongst the highest percent of branch changes in the IIT system (perhaps with the exception of IIT Gandhinagar), a sign of a very liberal system.Of course, getting into Computer Science and Engineering continued to be extremely difficult. Students needed a CPI of 10.0, and 10 students with that CPI could move to CSE. Getting into Electrical Engineering required a minimum CPI of 9.4, and I am surprised that only 10 students moved into EE. Getting into Mathematics and Scientific Computing as well as Mechanical Engineering was equally difficult, and both could accommodate students with a CPI of 8.7 or higher. Interesting to see Mathematics becoming so popular compared to many of the Engineering programs. And finally, Chemical Engineering was up for grabs at a CPI of 8.0. Branch changes to all other 7 programs was available at any CPI. This is really strange. Just a year ago, all these students would have been complaining about their rank and how they could only get Material Science and not Aerospace or any other such combination, but now when the change was available to anyone on demand, they did not apply. May be they did not expect that rules have become so liberal, or they have realized that there are exciting things happening in all branches.It does not mean that everything is alright with the branch change process. A restriction on granting branch change only once means that if someone could get his/her 2nd choice as a branch change now, would not be able to apply for his/her 1st choice next semester or change his/her mind altogether. Prior to this restriction, there usually were either 0 such cases or 1 such case in a given batch. So what is being achieved by placing this restriction is not quite clear. But for that odd student, this is a terrible restriction.The second problem is the minimum student strength. Departments which do nothing to attract students should not be supported artificially by placing a minimum student strength below which a branch change will not be allowed, or that limit should be low enough that every student with a decent CPI should be able to leave the department if s/he so desires.",

    "title": "Grading Schemes for Evaluating Students",

      "It is well recognized by educationists all over the world that having evaluation in terms of discrete grades is better than giving continuous marks out of 100 (or whatever be the maximum marks). IITs and several other good quality institutes have been awarding grades for decades. Slowly, other universities in India are catching up with the practice. UGC recommends this. And even school boards are now coming around to the view that giving grades is better.",
      "There are two questions that arise. Better in what respect. What kind of grading pattern is to be selected, in particular, how many different grades be there in the grading scheme. Actually, the second question cannot be answered without understanding the first.",
      "The grades are better than marks because they reduce stress on the students. The world over, people have realized that performance metrics are extremely important for students, and they work hard to improve their measured performance. There are very few students who learn for the sake of learning. Normally, in a grading system, the students do have a sense of where they stand in a course, and therefore, what grade they can expect. They can estimate the effort they need to put in to maintain that grade, and the effort that is needed to improve the grade.",
      "Basically, when they are studying for marks, then every extra hour of studies before the exam, could lead to possibly a few more marks, and that pressurizes the student to study more. While ingrading system, a few extra hours of efforts on the last few days may not give him an improved grade, and therefore, the student can be more relaxed. He can spend more effort on courses where the chance of improving the grade is higher.",
      "Of course, we do want some stress on the students. We don’t want them to be completely relaxed throughout the year/semester to the extent that they don’t attend any classes, don’t do any assignments, don’t study for exams, etc. If we take the grading system to an extreme and have only two grades – Pass and Fail – there is absolutely no pressure on the student to study, and that leads to very poor performance on an average. (Many universities have tried pass/fail grades for a few courses, and have had the same result.)",
      "On the other hand, if we have a finer gradingsystem, and if we consider the extreme situation of a different grade for every percentage mark (basically the good old marks scheme), then there is tremendous pressure on the student and that is not good for the learning either.",
      "So, we need to find a balance. What is the right balance – there is no unanimity on this, as can be seen by the diversity of grading schemes in universities of the world. But what is of concern to me is that the grading schemes get changed for wrong reasons.",
      "Just before I assumed the role of Director at LNMIIT Jaipur, they had decided to change the grading scheme, and many students and even faculty were not happy with that, and therefore, I had occasions to listen to lots of arguments  in favor of the older scheme. Similarly, we have gone through lots of debates on this issue at IIT Kanpur.",
      "Basically, students want a finer grading system. Let us look at a system where there are 5 grades – ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, and ‘F’. The students in such a system would argue that if they are missing an ‘A’ grade and get a ‘B’ grade, it is too sharp a drop. If there was an intermediate grade, call it “A-” or “AB” or whatever, it would appear better on their transcript. This is a flawed argument since the assumption behind this argument is that whoever is getting an ‘A’ grade in the current system will continue to get an ‘A’ grade in the finer system. They don’t imagine that if there were a finer grade, some people from higher grade will be reduced to the intermediate grade as well. In fact, if we look at a 5-grade system on a 10 point scale, where passing grades have numerical equivalence of 4, 6, 8, and 10, and if we assume that the students will be equally divided in 4 bins, then the average CPI (or CGPA) would be 7. On the other hand, if we had finer grading system, and we had grades with numerical equivalence of each number from 4 to 10, and the number of students were equally divided into 7 bins now, the average CPI would remain 7. There have been many universities who have changed from coarse to finer grading and vice versa and have seen absolutely no change in their CPI/CGPA. So, the finer grades will only mean a slightly higher grade in a few courses, and a slightly lower grade in some other courses – with the overall impact on CPI being zero. So it really does not help the students.",
      "On the other hand, while students wouldn’t agree – since comparing the impact of two systems on the stress levels is impossible for an individual student – the experts agree that the finer grading system would lead to greater stress – more competition amongst the students. So, each university has to consider whether their students are too stressed out, spending too much time on examination related learning – then make the grading system coarser. On the other hand, if the students seem to be taking the exams and other evaluation mechanisms too lightly, it is time to consider a finer grading system.",
      "At the end, I will like to point out that the grades reduce stress primarily when the student can do a trade off between the effort and the expected grade. This trade off is possible only when there is a continuous evaluation process, whereby the student can correlated the effort and performance over a period of time before the final exam. Hence having exams/quizzes/assignments/projects and other evaluations throughout the year (or semester) is important for success of grading schemes. (Continuous evaluation is anyway a good idea, even if one is not implementing any grading scheme – so that the students learn at a smooth pace throughout the year/semester, and not having to cram everything at the last minute.)"

      "In the last few months, IIT Kanpur has made its academic programs more flexible. For example, it has discontinued admission to five year BTech MTech dual-degree programs. Now, the students take admission to the BTech program, and in the 3rd year decide whether they want to spend an extra year to get an MTech degree as well. Similarly, it has started dual-major programs, whereby the student in the 3rd year can decide to get a second BTech degree in one extra year. Yet another change is re-introduction of minor programs, whereby a student can do 3-4 courses in a specified area and the transcript will mention that s/he has completed a minor program in that area. The flexibility is same for science programs also. The student gets admitted to 4-year BS program, but will have an option to do BS-MS dual-degree, or BS-BS or BS-BTech dual major, or a minor in another discipline. IIT Kanpur has also introduced an Engineering Science degree for which there is no admission through JEE, but students can chose to get into this program as a branch change option.",
      "All these changes are applicable to students who are getting admitted to IIT Kanpur in 2011.",
      "In my opinion, the Institute should attempt to make all options (or as many as possible) available to existing students as well. What that means is that the existing BTech-MTech dual-degree students should have an option to change to BTech degree only (this should be easy to implement for Y10, Y09, and Y08 batches, if not Y07 batch). It should be possible for an existing student to spend extra time and get another undergraduate degree. Again, this should be easy to implement for Y10 and Y09 batches, while Y08 batches may have to spend not just 2 semesters extra, but 3 semesters extra. It should be possible for existing students to opt for a minor. Again, trivial to implement for Y10 batch, and certainly something can be worked out for most Y09 batch students.",
      "Why should such a flexibility be extended to existing students is the question many faculty members have asked me.",
      "My argument is simple. Whenever we decide on a change, it is because we think that in today’s context, the new rule/system is better than the old rule/system. Otherwise, we would not have decided on that change. If the new system is better, then the benefit of that “better” system should be available to as many people as possible.",
      "So any change that we approve for Y11 batch, we should also look into the possibility of making it available to existing students. Of course, we may come to the conclusion that there is no easy way to incorporate the new system into the old, and therefore, we can’t extend the benefit to the old students. But, in general, the benefit of any good idea should be extended to as many stake holders as possible.",
      "Now, of course, those stake holders may have a different point of view, and they may consider the old system to be beneficial to them in some way. Therefore, most good universities, when they decide on something new, give an option to the existing students that they can follow either the old system or the new system (except, as I said above, in cases where adapting new system for old students is very difficult).",
      "Faculty members argue that if we extend any benefit to existing students, then we will be unfair to those students who did not take admission to IIT Kanpur, because they were told about the existing rules then. Hmmm. So we want to be more fair to those who did not take admission to IIT Kanpur, and less fair to those who did take admission to IIT Kanpur.",
      "By this logic, we cannot provide any significant benefit to existing students that we did not announce at the admission time. We cannot, for example, change branch change rules for existing students. An extreme example of this logic would be the following: We should not allow existing students to use the latest sporting facilities, since they were not told about it at the time of admission. If we had told about the upcoming facilities then, perhaps others would have been attracted to IITK, and the current students would not have been able to get admission. So by allowing such an access, we are being unfair to all those who did not take admission to IITK then.",
